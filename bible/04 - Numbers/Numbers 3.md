1 This [[H428]] is the account [[H8435]] of Aaron [[H175]] and Moses [[H4872]] at the time [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H854]] Moses [[H4872]] on Mount [[H2022]] Sinai. [[H5514]] 
2 These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron: [[H175]] Nadab [[H5070]] the firstborn; [[H1060]] then Abihu, [[H30]] Eleazar, [[H499]] and Ithamar. [[H385]] 
3 These [[H428]] [were] Aaron’s [[H175]] sons, [[H1121]] the anointed [[H4886]] priests, [[H3548]] who [[H834]] were ordained [[H4390]] to serve as priests. [[H3547]] 
4 Nadab [[H5070]] and Abihu, however, [[H30]] died [[H4191]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] when they offered [[H7126]] strange [[H2114]] fire [[H784]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai. [[H5514]] And since they had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] sons, [[H1121]] only Eleazar [[H499]] and Ithamar [[H385]] served as priests [[H3547]] during [[H5921]] the lifetime [[H6440]] of their father [[H1]] Aaron. [[H175]] 
5 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
6 “Bring [[H7126]] the tribe [[H4294]] of Levi [[H3881]] and present [[H5975]] them to [[H6440]] Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] to assist him. [[H8334]] 
7 They are to perform [[H8104]] duties for him [[H4931]] and for the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] before [[H6440]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] attending [[H5647]] to the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle. [[H4908]] 
8 They shall take care of [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] the furnishings [[H3627]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and [[H853]] fulfill obligations [[H4931]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] by attending [[H5647]] to the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle. [[H4908]] 
9 Assign [[H5414]] the Levites [[H3881]] to Aaron [[H175]] and his sons; [[H1121]] they [[H1992]] have been given exclusively [[H5414]] to him  from among [[H854]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
10 So [[H853]] you shall appoint [[H6485]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] to carry out [[H8104]] the duties of the priesthood; [[H3550]] but any layman [[H2114]] who approaches [the tabernacle] [[H7126]] must be put to death.” [[H4191]] 
11 Again the LORD [[H3069]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]] 
12 “Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] have taken [[H3947]] the Levites [[H3881]] from among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] in place of [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H6363]] Israelite [[H1121]] from the womb. [[H7358]] The Levites [[H3881]] belong [[H1961]] to Me,  
13 because [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] [are] Mine.  On the day [[H3117]] I struck down [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H1060]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] I consecrated [[H6942]] to Myself  all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] in Israel, [[H3478]] both man [[H120]] and [[H5704]] beast. [[H929]] They are Mine; [[H1961]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
14 Then the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai, [[H5514]] saying, [[H559]] 
15 “Register [[H6485]] the Levites [[H1121]] by their families [[H1]] and clans. [[H4940]] You are to count [[H6485]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] a month old [[H1121]] or more.” [[H4605]] 
16 So Moses [[H4872]] numbered [[H6485]] them [[H853]] according to [[H5921]] the word [[H6310]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] he had been commanded. [[H6680]] 
17 These [[H428]] were [[H1961]] the sons [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3881]] by name: [[H8034]] Gershon, [[H1648]] Kohath, [[H6955]] and Merari. [[H4847]] 
18 These [[H428]] were the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Gershon [[H1648]] by their clans: [[H4940]] Libni [[H3845]] and Shimei. [[H8096]] 
19 The sons [[H1121]] of Kohath [[H6955]] by their clans [[H4940]] were Amram, [[H6019]] Izhar, [[H3324]] Hebron, [[H2275]] and Uzziel. [[H5816]] 
20 And the sons [[H1121]] of Merari [[H4847]] by their clans [[H4940]] were Mahli [[H4249]] and Mushi. [[H4187]] These [[H428]] were [[H1992]] the clans [[H4940]] of the Levites, [[H3881]] according to their families. [[H1]] 
21 From Gershon came [[H1648]] the Libnite [[H3846]] clan [[H4940]] and the Shimeite [[H8097]] clan; [[H4940]] these [[H428]] were the Gershonite [[H1649]] clans. [[H4940]] 
22 The number [[H6485]] of all [[H3605]] the males [[H2145]] a month old [[H1121]] or more [[H4605]] was [[H6485]] 7,500 [[H7651]] 
23 The Gershonite [[H1649]] clans [[H4940]] were to camp [[H2583]] on the west, [[H3220]] behind [[H310]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] 
24 and the leader [[H5387]] of the families [[H1004]] of the Gershonites [[H1649]] was Eliasaph [[H460]] son [[H1121]] of Lael. [[H3815]] 
25 The duties [[H4931]] of the Gershonites [[H1121]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] [were] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and tent, [[H168]] its covering, [[H4372]] the curtain [[H4539]] for the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] 
26 the curtains [[H7050]] of the courtyard, [[H2691]] the curtain [[H4539]] for the entrance [[H6607]] to the courtyard [[H2691]] that [[H834]] surrounds [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and altar, [[H4196]] and the cords— [[H4340]] all [[H3605]] the service [for these items]. [[H5656]] 
27 From Kohath came [[H6955]] the clans [[H4940]] of the Amramites, [[H6020]] the Izharites, [[H3325]] the Hebronites, [[H2276]] and the Uzzielites; [[H5817]] these [[H428]] were the clans [[H4940]] of the Kohathites. [[H6956]] 
28 The number [[H4557]] of all [[H3605]] the males [[H2145]] a month old [[H1121]] or more [[H4605]] was 8,600. [[H8083]] They were responsible for [[H8104]] the duties [[H4931]] of the sanctuary. [[H6944]] 
29 The clans [[H4940]] of the Kohathites [[H1121]] were to camp [[H2583]] on [[H5921]] the south [[H8486]] side [[H3409]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] 
30 and the leader [[H5387]] of the families [[H1004]] of the Kohathites [[H6956]] was Elizaphan [[H469]] son [[H1121]] of Uzziel. [[H5816]] 
31 Their duties [[H4931]] [were] the ark, [[H727]] the table, [[H7979]] the lampstand, [[H4501]] the altars, [[H4196]] the articles [[H3627]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] used with them, [[H8334]] and the curtain— [[H4539]] all [[H3605]] the service [for these items]. [[H5656]] 
32 The chief [[H5387]] of the leaders [[H5387]] of the Levites [[H3881]] was Eleazar [[H499]] son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest; [[H3548]] he oversaw [[H6486]] those responsible for [[H8104]] the duties [[H4931]] of the sanctuary. [[H6944]] 
33 From Merari came [[H4847]] the clans [[H4940]] of the Mahlites [[H4250]] and Mushites; [[H4188]] these [[H428]] were the Merarite [[H4847]] clans. [[H4940]] 
34 The number [[H6485]] of all [[H3605]] the males [[H2145]] one month old [[H1121]] or more [[H4605]] was 6,200. [[H8337]] 
35 The leader [[H5387]] of the families [[H1004]] of the Merarites [[H4847]] was Zuriel [[H6700]] son [[H1121]] of Abihail; [[H32]] they were to camp [[H2583]] on [[H5921]] the north [[H6828]] side [[H3409]] of the tabernacle. [[H4908]] 
36 The duties [[H4931]] assigned [[H6486]] to the sons [[H1121]] of Merari [[H4847]] were the tabernacle’s [[H4908]] frames, [[H7175]] crossbars, [[H1280]] posts, [[H5982]] bases, [[H134]] all [[H3605]] its equipment, [[H3627]] and all [[H3605]] the service of these [items], [[H5656]] 
37 as well as the posts [[H5982]] of the surrounding [[H5439]] courtyard [[H2691]] with their bases, [[H134]] tent pegs, [[H3489]] and ropes. [[H4340]] 
38 Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and [Aaron's sons] [[H1121]] were to camp [[H2583]] to the east [[H6924]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] toward the sunrise, [[H4217]] before [[H6440]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] They were to perform [[H8104]] the duties [[H4931]] of the sanctuary [[H4720]] as a service [[H4931]] on behalf of the Israelites; [[H1121]] but any outsider [[H2114]] who approached [the sanctuary] [[H7126]] was to be put to death. [[H4191]] 
39 The total [[H3605]] number [[H6485]] of Levites [[H3881]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] registered [[H6485]] by their clans [[H4940]] at [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command, [[H6310]] including all [[H3605]] the males [[H2145]] a month old [[H1121]] or more, [[H4605]] was 22,000. [[H8147]] 
40 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to Moses, [[H4872]] “Number [[H6485]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H1060]] male [[H2145]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] a month old [[H1121]] or more, [[H4605]] and list [[H5375]] their names. [[H8034]] 
41 You are to take [[H3947]] the Levites [[H3881]] for Me—  I [[H589]] am the LORD— [[H3068]] in place of [[H8478]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the livestock [[H929]] of the Levites [[H3881]] in place of [[H8478]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of the livestock [[H929]] of the Israelites.” [[H1121]] 
42 So Moses [[H4872]] numbered [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H853]] 
43 The total [[H3605]] number [[H6485]] of the firstborn [[H1060]] males [[H2145]] a month old [[H1121]] or more, [[H4605]] listed [[H4557]] by name, [[H8034]] was [[H1961]] 22,273 [[H8147]] 
44 Again the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]] 
45 “Take [[H3947]] the Levites [[H3881]] in place [[H8478]] of all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the cattle [[H929]] of the Levites [[H3881]] in place of [[H8478]] their cattle. [[H929]] The Levites [[H3881]] belong to Me; [[H1961]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
46 To redeem [[H6302]] the 273 [[H7969]] firstborn [[H1060]] Israelites [[H1121]] who outnumber [[H5736]] the Levites, [[H3881]] 
47 you are to collect [[H3947]] five [[H2568]] shekels [[H8255]] for each one, [[H1538]] according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel [[H8255]] of twenty [[H6242]] gerahs. [[H1626]] 
48 Give [[H5414]] the money [[H3701]] to Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] as the redemption price [[H6302]] for the excess [[H5736]] among [the Israelites].”  
49 So Moses [[H4872]] collected [[H3947]] the redemption [[H6306]] money [[H3701]] from those in excess [[H5736]] of [[H5921]] the number redeemed [[H6302]] by the Levites. [[H3881]] 
50 He collected [[H3947]] the money [[H3701]] from the firstborn [[H1060]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] 1,365 [[H2568]] shekels, [[H8255]] according to the sanctuary shekel. [[H6944]] 
51 And Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H5414]] the redemption [[H6302]] money [[H3701]] to Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] in obedience to [[H5921]] the word [[H6310]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] [him]. [[H4872]]
