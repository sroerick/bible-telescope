[[Numbers 34|←]] • [[Numbers 36|→]]
1 Again the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] on the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] by [[H5921]] the Jordan [[H3383]] across from Jericho: [[H3405]] 
2 “Command [[H6680]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to give, [[H5414]] from the inheritance [[H5159]] they will possess, [[H272]] cities [[H5892]] for the Levites [[H3881]] to live in [[H3427]] and pasturelands [[H4054]] around [[H5439]] the cities. [[H5892]] 
3 The cities [[H5892]] will be [[H1961]] for them to live in, [[H3427]] and the pasturelands [[H4054]] will be [[H1961]] for their herds, [[H929]] flocks, [[H7399]] and all [[H3605]] their other livestock. [[H2416]] 
4 The pasturelands [[H4054]] around the cities [[H5892]] you are to give [[H5414]] the Levites [[H3881]] [will extend] [[H2351]] a thousand [[H505]] cubits [[H520]] from the wall [[H7023]] on every side. [[H5439]] 
5 You are also to measure [[H4058]] two thousand [[H505]] cubits [[H520]] outside [[H2351]] the city [[H5892]] on the east, [[H6924]] two thousand [[H505]] cubits [[H520]] on the south, [[H5045]] two thousand [[H505]] cubits [[H520]] and on the west, [[H3220]] [and] two thousand [[H505]] cubits [[H520]] on the north, [[H6828]] with the city [[H5892]] in the center. [[H8432]] These areas [[H2088]] will serve [[H1961]] as larger pasturelands [[H4054]] for the cities. [[H5892]] 
6 Six [[H8337]] of the cities [[H5892]] you give [[H5414]] the Levites [[H3881]] are to be appointed [[H5414]] as cities [[H5892]] of refuge, [[H4733]] to which a manslayer [[H7523]] may flee. [[H5127]] In addition to these, [[H5921]] give [the Levites] [[H5414]] forty-two [[H705]] other cities. [[H5892]] 
7 The total [[H3605]] number of cities [[H5892]] you give [[H5414]] the Levites [[H3881]] [will be] forty-eight, [[H705]] with their corresponding [[H853]] pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
8 The cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] you apportion [[H5414]] from the territory [[H272]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] should be given [[H5414]] to the Levites [[H3881]] in proportion to [[H6310]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of each [tribe]: [[H376]] more from [[H7235]] a larger [tribe] [[H7227]] and less from [[H4591]] a smaller one. [[H4592]] 
9 Then the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
10 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell them: [[H559]] When [[H3588]] you [[H859]] cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] into the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] 
11 designate [[H7136]] cities [[H5892]] to serve as [[H1961]] your  cities [[H5892]] of refuge, [[H4733]] so that a person [[H7523]] who kills [[H5221]] someone [[H5315]] unintentionally [[H7684]] may flee [[H5127]] there. [[H8033]] 
12 You are to have [[H1961]] these cities [[H5892]] as a refuge [[H4733]] from the avenger, [[H1350]] so that the manslayer [[H7523]] will not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] until [[H5704]] he stands [[H5975]] trial [[H4941]] before [[H6440]] the assembly. [[H5712]] 
13 The cities [[H5892]] you select [[H5414]] will be [[H1961]] your six [[H8337]] cities [[H5892]] of refuge. [[H4733]] 
14 Select three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] and three [[H7969]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] as [[H1961]] cities [[H5892]] of refuge. [[H4733]] 
15 These [[H428]] six [[H8337]] cities [[H5892]] will serve [[H1961]] as a refuge [[H4733]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] and for the foreigner [[H1616]] or sojourner [[H8453]] among them, [[H8432]] so that anyone [[H3605]] who kills [[H5221]] a person [[H5315]] unintentionally [[H7684]] may flee [[H5127]] there. [[H8033]] 
16 If, however, [[H518]] anyone strikes [[H5221]] a person with an iron [[H1270]] object [[H3627]] and kills him, [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] is a murderer; [[H7523]] the murderer [[H7523]] must surely be put to death. [[H4191]] 
17 Or if [[H518]] anyone has in his hand [[H3027]] a stone [[H68]] of deadly size, [[H4191]] and he strikes [[H5221]] and kills another, [[H4191]] he is a murderer; [[H7523]] the murderer [[H7523]] must surely be put to death. [[H4191]] 
18 If [[H176]] anyone has in his hand [[H3027]] a deadly [[H4191]] object [[H3627]] of wood, [[H6086]] and he strikes [[H5221]] and kills another, [[H4191]] he is a murderer; [[H7523]] the murderer [[H7523]] must surely be put to death. [[H4191]] 
19 The avenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] {is to put} the murderer [[H7523]] to death; [[H4191]] when he finds him, [[H6293]] he [[H1931]] is to kill him. [[H4191]] 
20 Likewise, if [[H518]] anyone maliciously [[H8135]] pushes another [[H1920]] or [[H176]] intentionally [[H6660]] throws an object [[H7993]] at him [[H5921]] and kills him, [[H4191]] 
21 or [[H176]] if in hostility [[H342]] he strikes [[H5221]] him with his hand [[H3027]] and he dies, [[H4191]] the one who struck him [[H5221]] must surely be put to death; [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] is a murderer. [[H7523]] When the avenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] finds [[H6293]] the murderer, [[H7523]] he is to kill [[H4191]] him. [[H853]] 
22 But if anyone [[H518]] pushes a person [[H1920]] suddenly, [[H6621]] without [[H3808]] hostility, [[H342]] or [[H176]] unintentionally [[H3808]] hits him [[H7993]] with an [[H3605]] object, [[H3627]] 
23 or [[H176]] without [[H3808]] looking [[H7200]] drops [[H5307]] a heavy stone [[H68]] that kills him, [[H4191]] but he [[H1931]] was not [[H3808]] an enemy [[H341]] and did not [[H3808]] intend [[H1245]] to harm him, [[H7451]] 
24 then the congregation [[H5712]] must judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] the slayer [[H5221]] and the avenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] according to [[H5921]] these [[H428]] ordinances. [[H4941]] 
25 The assembly [[H5712]] is to protect [[H5337]] the manslayer [[H7523]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the avenger [[H1350]] of blood. [[H1818]] Then the assembly [[H5712]] will return [[H7725]] him to [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] to which he fled, [[H5127]] and he must live [[H3427]] there until [[H5704]] the death [[H4194]] of the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] who [[H834]] was anointed [[H4886]] with the holy [[H6944]] oil. [[H8081]] 
26 But if [[H518]] the manslayer [[H7523]] ever goes outside [[H3318]] the limits [[H1366]] of the city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] to which he fled [[H5127]] 
27 and the avenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] finds [[H4672]] him [[H853]] outside [[H2351]] of his city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] and kills him, [[H7523]] the avenger [[H1350]] will not [[H369]] be guilty of bloodshed, [[H1818]] 
28 because [[H3588]] [the manslayer] must remain [[H3427]] in his city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] until [[H5704]] the death [[H4194]] of the high [[H1419]] priest. [[H3548]] Only after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] may [he] [[H7523]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] he owns. [[H272]] 
29 This [[H428]] will be [[H1961]] a statutory [[H4941]] ordinance [[H2708]] for you  for the generations to come, [[H1755]] wherever [[H3605]] you live. [[H4186]] 
30 If anyone [[H3605]] kills [[H5221]] a person, [[H5315]] the murderer [[H7523]] is to be put to death [[H7523]] on the testimony [[H6310]] of [multiple] witnesses. [[H5707]] But no [[H3808]] one [[H5315]] is to be put to death [[H4191]] based on the testimony [[H6030]] of a lone [[H259]] witness. [[H5707]] 
31 You are not [[H3808]] to accept [[H3947]] a ransom [[H3724]] for the life [[H5315]] of a murderer [[H7523]] who [[H834]] deserves [[H7563]] to die; [[H4191]] he must surely be put to death. [[H4191]] 
32 Nor [[H3808]] should you accept [[H3947]] a ransom [[H3724]] for the person who flees [[H5127]] to [[H413]] a city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] and allow him to return [[H7725]] and live [[H3427]] on his own land [[H776]] before [[H5704]] the death [[H4194]] of the high priest. [[H3548]] 
33 Do not [[H3808]] pollute [[H2610]] the land [[H776]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] live,  for [[H3588]] bloodshed [[H1818]] pollutes [[H2610]] the land, [[H776]] and no [[H3808]] atonement can be made [[H3722]] for the land [[H776]] on which the blood [[H1818]] is shed, [[H8210]] except [[H3588]] by the blood [[H1818]] of the one who shed it. [[H8210]] 
34 Do not [[H3808]] defile [[H2930]] the land [[H776]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] live [[H3427]] and where [[H834]] I [[H589]] dwell. [[H7931]] For [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] dwell [[H7931]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites.” [[H1121]]
