[[Numbers 18|←]] • [[Numbers 20|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
2 “This [[H2063]] is the statute [[H2708]] of the law [[H8451]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded: [[H6680]] Instruct [[H1696]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to bring [[H3947]] you [[H413]] an unblemished [[H8549]] red [[H122]] heifer [[H6510]] that [[H834]] has no [[H369]] defect [[H3971]] and has never [[H3808]] been placed [[H5927]] under a yoke. [[H5923]] 
3 Give [[H5414]] it to [[H413]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and he will have it brought [[H3318]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] and slaughtered [[H7819]] in his presence. [[H6440]] 
4 Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] some of its blood [[H1818]] with his finger [[H676]] and sprinkle [[H5137]] [it] [[H1818]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] toward [[H413]] the front [[H6440]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
5 Then the heifer [[H6510]] must be burned [[H8313]] in his sight. [[H5869]] Its hide, [[H5785]] its flesh, [[H1320]] and its blood [[H1818]] are to be burned, [[H8313]] along with [[H5921]] its dung. [[H6569]] 
6 The priest [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] cedar [[H730]] wood, [[H6086]] hyssop, [[H231]] and scarlet wool [[H8144]] and throw [[H7993]] them [[H413]] onto [[H8432]] the burning [[H8316]] heifer. [[H6510]] 
7 Then the priest [[H3548]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] his body [[H1320]] in water; [[H4325]] after that [[H310]] he may enter [[H935]] the camp, [[H4264]] but he [[H3548]] will be ceremonially unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
8 The one who burned [[H8313]] [the heifer] [[H853]] must also wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] his body [[H1320]] in water, [[H4325]] and he too will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
9 Then a man [[H376]] who is clean [[H2889]] is to gather up [[H622]] the ashes [[H665]] of the heifer [[H6510]] and store [them] [[H3240]] in a ceremonially clean [[H2889]] place [[H4725]] outside [[H2351]] the camp. [[H4264]] They must be [[H1961]] kept [[H4931]] by the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] for preparing the water [[H4325]] of purification; [[H5079]] this [is] [[H1931]] for purification from sin. [[H2403]] 
10 The man who has gathered up [[H622]] the ashes [[H665]] of the heifer [[H6510]] must also wash [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] This [[H1961]] is a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] and for the foreigner [[H1616]] residing [[H1481]] among them. [[H8432]] 
11 Whoever touches [[H5060]] any [[H3605]] dead [[H4191]] body [[H5315]] will be unclean [[H2930]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
12 He [[H1931]] must purify himself with the water [[H2398]] on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] and the seventh [[H7637]] day; [[H3117]] then he will be clean. [[H2891]] But if [[H518]] he does not [[H3808]] purify [[H2398]] himself on the third [[H7992]] and seventh [[H7637]] days, [[H3117]] he will not [[H3808]] be clean. [[H2891]] 
13 Anyone [[H3605]] who touches [[H5060]] a corpse, [[H4191]] the body [[H5315]] of a person [[H120]] who [[H834]] has died, [[H4191]] and does not [[H3808]] purify [[H2398]] himself, [[H853]] defiles [[H2930]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the LORD. [[H3069]] That [[H1931]] person [[H5315]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from Israel. [[H3478]] He remains [[H1961]] unclean, [[H2931]] because [[H3588]] the water [[H4325]] of purification [[H5079]] has not [[H3808]] been sprinkled [[H2236]] on him, [[H5921]] and his uncleanness [[H2932]] is still on him. [[H5750]] 
14 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] when [[H3588]] a person [[H120]] dies [[H4191]] in a tent: [[H168]] Everyone [[H3605]] who enters [[H935]] the tent [[H168]] and everyone [[H3605]] already in the tent [[H168]] will be unclean [[H2930]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] 
15 and any [[H3605]] open [[H6605]] container [[H3627]] without [[H369]] a lid [[H6781]] fastened [[H6616]] on it [[H5921]] is unclean. [[H2931]] 
16 Anyone [[H3605]] in [[H5921]] the open field [[H6440]] who [[H834]] touches [[H5060]] someone who has been killed [[H2491]] by the sword [[H2719]] or [[H176]] has died of natural causes, [[H4191]] or [[H176]] anyone who touches a human [[H120]] bone [[H6106]] or [[H176]] a grave, [[H6913]] will be unclean [[H2930]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
17 [For the purification] of the unclean person, [[H2931]] take [[H3947]] some of the ashes [[H6083]] of the burnt purification [[H8316]] offering, [[H2403]] put [[H5414]] them in [[H413]] a jar, [[H3627]] and pour fresh running [[H2416]] water [[H4325]] over them. [[H5921]] 
18 Then a man [[H376]] who is ceremonially clean [[H2889]] is to take [[H3947]] some hyssop, [[H231]] dip [[H2881]] it in the water, [[H4325]] and sprinkle [[H5137]] the tent, [[H168]] all [[H3605]] the furnishings, [[H3627]] and the people [[H5315]] who [[H834]] were [[H1961]] there. [[H8033]] He is also to sprinkle the one who touched [[H5060]] the bone, [[H6106]] grave, [[H6913]] corpse, [[H4191]] or [[H176]] person who had been killed. [[H2491]] 
19 The man who is clean [[H2889]] is to sprinkle [[H5137]] the unclean person [[H2931]] on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] and the seventh [[H7637]] day. [[H3117]] After he purifies [[H2398]] the unclean person on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] [the one being cleansed] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] in water, [[H4325]] and he will be clean [[H2891]] by evening. [[H6153]] 
20 But if a person [[H376]] who [[H834]] is unclean [[H2930]] does not [[H3808]] purify [[H2398]] himself, [[H1931]] [he] [[H5315]] will be cut off [[H3772]] from [[H8432]] the assembly, [[H6951]] because [[H3588]] he has defiled [[H2930]] the sanctuary [[H4720]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] The water [[H4325]] of [purification] [[H5079]] has not [[H3808]] been sprinkled [[H2236]] on him; [[H5921]] he [[H1931]] is unclean. [[H2931]] 
21 This [[H1961]] is a permanent [[H5769]] statute for [the people]: [[H2708]] The one who sprinkles [[H5137]] the water [[H4325]] of [purification] [[H5079]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] and whoever touches [[H5060]] the water [[H4325]] of [purification] [[H5079]] will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
22 Anything [[H3605]] the unclean [[H2931]] person touches [[H5060]] will become unclean, [[H2930]] and anyone [[H5315]] who touches it [[H5060]] will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening.” [[H6153]]
