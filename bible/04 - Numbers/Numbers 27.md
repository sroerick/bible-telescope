1 Now the daughters [[H1323]] of Zelophehad [[H6765]] son [[H1121]] of Hepher, [[H2660]] the son [[H1121]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] the son [[H1121]] of Machir, [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] belonged to the clans [[H4940]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] son [[H1121]] of Joseph. [[H3130]] These [[H428]] were the names [[H8034]] of his daughters: [[H1323]] Mahlah, [[H4244]] Noah, [[H5270]] Hoglah, [[H2295]] Milcah, [[H4435]] and Tirzah. [[H8656]] They approached [[H7126]] 
2 the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Moses, [[H4872]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] the leaders, [[H5387]] and the entire [[H3605]] congregation, [[H5712]] and said, [[H559]] 
3 “Our father [[H1]] died [[H4191]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] but he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] among [[H8432]] the followers [[H5712]] of Korah [[H7141]] who gathered together [[H3259]] against [[H5921]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Instead, [[H3588]] he died [[H4191]] because of his own sin, [[H2399]] and he had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] sons. [[H1121]] 
4 Why [[H4100]] should the name [[H8034]] of our father [[H1]] disappear [[H1639]] from [[H8432]] his clan [[H4940]] because [[H3588]] he had no [[H369]] sons? [[H1121]] Give [[H5414]] us property [[H272]] among [[H8432]] our father’s [[H1]] brothers.” [[H251]] 
5 So Moses [[H4872]] brought [[H7126]] their case [[H4941]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] 
6 and the LORD [[H3068]] answered [[H559]] him, [[H4872]] 
7 “The daughters [[H1323]] of Zelophehad [[H6765]] speak [[H1696]] correctly. [[H3651]] You certainly must give [[H5414]] them  property [[H272]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] their father’s [[H1]] brothers [[H251]] and transfer [[H5674]] their [[H853]] father’s [[H1]] inheritance [[H5159]] to them.  
8 Furthermore, [[H413]] you shall say [[H1696]] to the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] dies [[H4191]] and leaves no [[H369]] son, [[H1121]] you are to transfer [[H5674]] his inheritance [[H5159]] to his daughter. [[H1323]] 
9 If [[H518]] he has no [[H369]] daughter, [[H1323]] give [[H5414]] his inheritance [[H5159]] to his brothers. [[H251]] 
10 If [[H518]] he has no [[H369]] brothers, [[H251]] give [[H5414]] his inheritance [[H5159]] to his father’s [[H1]] brothers. [[H251]] 
11 And if [[H518]] his father [[H1]] has no [[H369]] brothers, [[H251]] give [[H5414]] his inheritance [[H5159]] to the next [[H7138]] of kin [[H7607]] from his clan, [[H4940]] that he may take possession of it. [[H3423]] This is to be [[H1961]] a statutory [[H4941]] ordinance [[H2708]] for the Israelites, [[H1121]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] has commanded [[H6680]] Moses.’” [[H4872]] 
12 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Go up [[H5927]] this [[H2088]] mountain [[H2022]] of the Abarim range [[H5682]] and see [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
13 After you have seen it, [[H7200]] you [[H859]] too will [[H1571]] be gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] your people, [[H5971]] as [[H834]] your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] was; [[H622]] 
14 for [[H834]] when the congregation [[H5712]] contended [[H4808]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin, [[H6790]] both of you rebelled [[H4784]] against My command [[H6310]] to show My holiness [[H6942]] in their sight [[H5869]] regarding the waters.” [[H4325]] Those [[H1992]] were the waters [[H4325]] of Meribah [[H4809]] in Kadesh, [[H6946]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin. [[H6790]] 
15 So Moses [[H4872]] appealed [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] 
16 “May the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of the spirits [[H7307]] of all [[H3605]] flesh, [[H1320]] appoint [[H6485]] a man [[H376]] over [[H5921]] the congregation [[H5712]] 
17 who [[H834]] will go out [[H3318]] and come in [[H935]] before them, [[H6440]] and who [[H834]] will lead them out [[H3318]] and bring them in, [[H935]] so that the congregation [[H5712]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] like sheep [[H6629]] without [[H369]] a shepherd.” [[H7462]] 
18 And the LORD [[H3068]] replied [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Take [[H3947]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] a man with [[H376]] the Spirit in him, [[H7307]] and lay [[H5564]] your hands [[H3027]] on him. [[H5921]] 
19 Have him stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] and the whole [[H3605]] congregation, [[H5712]] and commission [[H6680]] him in their sight. [[H5869]] 
20 Confer [[H5414]] on him [[H5921]] [some of] your authority, [[H1935]] so that [[H4616]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] will obey him. [[H8085]] 
21 He shall stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] who will seek counsel [[H7592]] for him  before the LORD [[H3068]] by the judgment [[H4941]] of the Urim. [[H224]] At [[H5921]] his command [[H6310]] he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] with him, [[H854]] the entire [[H3605]] congregation, [[H5712]] will go out [[H3318]] and come in.” [[H935]] 
22 Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded him. [[H6680]] He took [[H3947]] Joshua, [[H3091]] had him stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] and the whole [[H3605]] congregation, [[H5712]] 
23 and laid [[H5564]] his hands [[H3027]] on him [[H5921]] and commissioned him, [[H6680]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had instructed [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]]
