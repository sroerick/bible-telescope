[[Numbers 5|←]] • [[Numbers 7|→]]
1 Again the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell [[H559]] them: [[H413]] If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] or [[H176]] woman [[H802]] makes a special [[H6381]] vow, [[H5087]] the vow [[H5088]] of a Nazirite, [[H5139]] to separate himself [[H5144]] to the LORD, [[H3069]] 
3 he is to abstain [[H5144]] from wine [[H3196]] and strong drink. [[H7941]] He must not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] vinegar [[H2558]] made from wine [[H3196]] [or] strong drink, [[H7941]] and he must not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] any [[H3605]] grape [[H6025]] juice [[H4952]] or eat [[H398]] fresh [[H3892]] grapes [[H6025]] or raisins. [[H3002]] 
4 All [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his separation, [[H5145]] he is not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] anything that comes from [[H6213]] the grapevine, [[H1612]] not even the seeds [[H2785]] or [[H5704]] skins. [[H2085]] 
5 For the entire [[H3605]] period [[H3117]] of his vow [[H5088]] of separation, [[H5145]] no [[H3808]] razor [[H8593]] shall pass [[H5674]] over [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]] He must be [[H1961]] holy [[H6918]] until [[H5704]] the time [[H3117]] of [[H834]] his separation [[H5144]] to the LORD [[H3068]] is complete; [[H4390]] he must let the hair [[H8181]] of his head [[H7218]] grow [[H1431]] long. [[H6545]] 
6 Throughout [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his separation [[H5144]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] he must not [[H3808]] go [[H935]] near [[H5921]] a dead [[H4191]] body. [[H5315]] 
7 Even if his father [[H1]] or mother [[H517]] or brother [[H251]] or sister [[H269]] should die, [[H4194]] he is not [[H3808]] to defile himself, [[H2930]] because [[H3588]] the crown of consecration [[H5145]] to his God [[H430]] is upon [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]] 
8 Throughout the time [[H3605]] of his separation, [[H5145]] he [[H1931]] is holy [[H6918]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
9 If [[H3588]] someone suddenly [[H6621]] dies [[H4191]] in his presence [[H5921]] and defiles [[H2930]] his consecrated head [[H7218]] of hair, [[H5145]] he must shave [[H1548]] his head [[H7218]] on the day [[H3117]] of his cleansing— [[H2893]] the seventh [[H7637]] day. [[H3117]] 
10 On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] he must bring [[H935]] two [[H8147]] turtledoves [[H8449]] or [[H176]] two [[H8147]] young [[H1121]] pigeons [[H3123]] to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
11 And the priest [[H3548]] is to offer [[H6213]] one [[H259]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] and the other [[H259]] as a burnt offering [[H5930]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for him, [[H5921]] because [[H834]] he has sinned [[H2398]] by being in the presence [[H5921]] of the dead body. [[H5315]] On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] he must consecrate [[H6942]] his head again. [[H7218]] 
12 He must rededicate [[H5144]] his time [[H3117]] of separation [[H5145]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and bring [[H935]] a year-old [[H1121]] male lamb [[H3532]] as a guilt offering. [[H817]] But the preceding [[H7223]] days [[H3117]] shall not be counted, [[H5307]] because [[H3588]] his separation [[H5145]] was defiled. [[H2930]] 
13 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of the Nazirite [[H5139]] when [[H3117]] his time [[H3117]] of separation [[H5145]] is complete: [[H4390]] He must be brought [[H935]] to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] 
14 and he is to present [[H7126]] an offering [[H7133]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of an [[H259]] unblemished [[H8549]] year-old [[H1121]] male lamb [[H3532]] as a burnt offering, [[H5930]] an [[H259]] unblemished [[H8549]] year-old [[H1323]] female lamb [[H3535]] as a sin offering, [[H2403]] and an [[H259]] unblemished [[H8549]] ram [[H352]] as a peace offering— [[H8002]] 
15 together with their grain offerings [[H4503]] and drink offerings— [[H5262]] and a basket [[H5536]] of unleavened [[H4682]] cakes [[H2471]] made from fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with oil [[H8081]] and unleavened [[H4682]] wafers [[H7550]] coated [[H4886]] with oil. [[H8081]] 
16 The priest [[H3548]] is to present all these [[H7126]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] and make [[H6213]] the sin offering [[H2403]] and [[H853]] the burnt offering. [[H5930]] 
17 He shall also offer [[H6213]] the ram [[H352]] as a peace offering [[H8002]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] along with [[H5921]] the basket [[H5536]] of unleavened bread. [[H4682]] And the priest [[H3548]] is to offer [[H6213]] the accompanying grain offering [[H4503]] and drink offering. [[H5262]] 
18 Then at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] the Nazirite [[H5139]] is to shave [[H1548]] his consecrated [[H5145]] head, [[H7218]] take [[H3947]] the hair, [[H8181]] and put [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] the fire [[H784]] under [[H8478]] the peace offering. [[H8002]] 
19 And the priest [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] the boiled [[H1311]] shoulder [[H2220]] from [[H4480]] the ram, [[H352]] one [[H259]] unleavened [[H4682]] cake [[H2471]] from [[H4480]] the basket, [[H5536]] and one [[H259]] unleavened [[H4682]] wafer, [[H7550]] and put [[H5414]] them into [[H5921]] the hands [[H3709]] of the Nazirite [[H5139]] who has just [[H310]] shaved [[H1548]] [the hair of] his consecration. [[H5145]] 
20 The priest [[H3548]] shall then wave [[H5130]] them [[H853]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] This [[H1931]] is a holy [[H6944]] portion for the priest, [[H3548]] in addition to [[H5921]] the breast [[H2373]] of the wave offering [[H8573]] and the thigh [[H7785]] that was presented. [[H8641]] After that, [[H310]] the Nazirite [[H5139]] may drink [[H8354]] wine. [[H3196]] 
21 This [[H2063]] [is] the law [[H8451]] of the Nazirite [[H5139]] who [[H834]] vows [[H5087]] his offering [[H7133]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for [[H5921]] his separation, [[H5145]] in addition to [[H905]] whatever else [[H834]] he can afford; [[H5381]] he must fulfill [[H6213]] whatever [[H834]] vow [[H5088]] he makes, [[H5087]] according to [[H5921]] the ritual [[H8451]] of his separation.” [[H5145]] 
22 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
23 “Tell [[H1696]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons: [[H1121]] This is how you are to bless [[H1288]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] Say to them: [[H559]] 
24 ‘May the LORD [[H3068]] bless you [[H1288]] and keep you; [[H8104]] 
25 may the LORD [[H3068]] cause His face [[H6440]] to shine [[H215]] upon you [[H413]] and be gracious to you; [[H2603]] 
26 may the LORD [[H3068]] lift up [[H5375]] His countenance [[H6440]] toward you [[H413]] and give [[H7760]] you  peace.’ [[H7965]] 
27 So they shall put [[H7760]] My name [[H8034]] on [[H5921]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] and I [[H589]] will bless them.” [[H1288]]
