# Numbers 20
[[Numbers 19|←]] • [[Numbers 21|→]]
1 In the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] entered [[H935]] the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin [[H6790]] [and] [[H5971]] stayed [[H3427]] in Kadesh. [[H6946]] There [[H8033]] Miriam [[H4813]] died [[H4191]] and was buried. [[H6912]] 
2 Now there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] water [[H4325]] for the congregation, [[H5712]] so they gathered [[H6950]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron. [[H175]] 
3 The people [[H5971]] quarreled [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] Moses [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] “If only [[H3863]] we had perished [[H1478]] when our brothers [[H251]] fell dead [[H1478]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 Why [[H4100]] have you brought [[H935]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] assembly [[H6951]] into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] wilderness [[H4057]] for us [[H587]] and our livestock [[H1165]] to die [[H4191]] here? [[H8033]] 
5 Why [[H4100]] have you led us up [[H5927]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] to bring [[H935]] us to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] wretched [[H7451]] place? [[H4725]] It is not [[H3808]] a place [[H4725]] of grain, [[H2233]] figs, [[H8384]] vines, [[H1612]] and pomegranates, [[H7416]] and there is no [[H369]] water [[H4325]] to drink!” [[H8354]] 
6 Then Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went [[H935]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the assembly [[H6951]] to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] They fell facedown, [[H5307]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to them. [[H413]] 
7 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
8 “Take [[H3947]] the staff [[H4294]] and assemble [[H6950]] the congregation. [[H5712]] You [[H859]] and your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] are to speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the rock [[H5553]] while they watch, [[H5869]] and it will pour out [[H5414]] its water. [[H4325]] You will bring out [[H3318]] water [[H4325]] from [[H4480]] the rock [[H5553]] and provide drink [[H8248]] for the congregation [[H5712]] and their livestock. [[H1165]] 
9 So Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the staff [[H4294]] from the LORD’s [[H3068]] presence, [[H6440]] just as [[H834]] He had commanded. [[H6680]] 
10 Then Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] gathered [[H6950]] the assembly [[H6951]] in [[H413]] front [[H6440]] of the rock, [[H5553]] and Moses said to them, [[H559]] “Listen [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] you rebels, [[H4784]] must we bring you water [[H4325]] out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] rock?” [[H5553]] 
11 Then Moses [[H4872]] raised [[H7311]] his hand [[H3027]] and struck [[H5221]] the rock [[H5553]] twice [[H6471]] with his staff, [[H4294]] so that a great amount of [[H7227]] water [[H4325]] gushed out, [[H3318]] and the congregation [[H5712]] and their livestock [[H1165]] were able to drink. [[H8354]] 
12 But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] “Because [[H3282]] you did not [[H3808]] trust [[H539]] Me  to show My holiness [[H6942]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] you will not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] this [[H2088]] assembly [[H6951]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] I have given them.” [[H5414]] 
13 These [[H1992]] were the waters [[H4325]] of Meribah, [[H4809]] where [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] quarreled [[H7378]] with [[H854]] the LORD, [[H3069]] and He showed His holiness [[H6942]] among them.  
14 From Kadesh [[H6946]] Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [tell] [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Edom, [[H123]] “This is what [[H3541]] your brother [[H251]] Israel [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] the hardship [[H8513]] that [[H834]] has befallen us, [[H4672]] 
15 how our fathers [[H1]] went down [[H3381]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] where we lived [[H3427]] many [[H7227]] years. [[H3117]] The Egyptians [[H4713]] mistreated us and our fathers, [[H1]] 
16 and when we cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] He heard [[H8085]] our voice, [[H6963]] sent [[H7971]] an angel, [[H4397]] and brought us [[H3318]] out of Egypt. [[H4714]] Now look, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] are in Kadesh, [[H6946]] a city [[H5892]] on the edge [[H7097]] of your territory. [[H1366]] 
17 Please [[H4994]] let us pass [[H5674]] through your land. [[H776]] We will not [[H3808]] cut [[H5674]] through any field [[H7704]] or vineyard, [[H3754]] [or] [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] from any well. [[H875]] We will stay on [[H1980]] the King’s [[H4428]] Highway; [[H1870]] we will not [[H3808]] turn [[H5186]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left [[H8040]] until [[H5704]] we have passed through [[H5674]] your territory. [[H1366]] 
18 But Edom [[H123]] answered, [[H559]] “You may not [[H3808]] travel [[H5674]] through our land, [[H6435]] or we will come out [[H3318]] and confront [[H7125]] you with the sword.” [[H2719]] 
19 “We will stay [[H5927]] on the main road,” [[H4546]] the Israelites [[H1121]] replied, [[H559]] “and if [[H518]] we [[H589]] or our herds [[H4735]] drink [[H8354]] your water, [[H4325]] we will pay [[H5414]] for it. [[H4377]] There will be no [[H369]] problem; [[H1697]] only [[H7535]] let us pass through [[H5674]] on foot.” [[H7272]] 
20 But Edom [[H123]] insisted, [[H559]] “You may not [[H3808]] pass through.” [[H5674]] And they came out [[H3318]] to confront [the Israelites] [[H7125]] with a large [[H3515]] army [[H5971]] and a strong [[H2389]] hand. [[H3027]] 
21 So Edom [[H123]] refused [[H3985]] to allow [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] to pass [[H5674]] through their territory, [[H1366]] and Israel [[H3478]] turned away [[H5186]] from them. [[H5921]] 
22 After they had set out [[H5265]] from Kadesh, [[H6946]] the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to Mount [[H2022]] Hor. [[H2023]] 
23 And at Mount [[H2022]] Hor, [[H2023]] near [[H5921]] the border [[H1366]] of the land [[H776]] of Edom, [[H123]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
24 “Aaron [[H175]] will be gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] his people; [[H5971]] he will not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] I have given [[H5414]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] because [[H5921]] both of you rebelled [[H4784]] against My command [[H6310]] at the waters [[H4325]] of Meribah. [[H4809]] 
25 Take [[H3947]] Aaron [[H175]] and his son [[H1121]] Eleazar [[H499]] and bring them up [[H5927]] Mount [[H2022]] Hor. [[H2023]] 
26 Remove [[H6584]] Aaron’s [[H175]] priestly garments [[H899]] and put them on [[H3847]] his son [[H1121]] Eleazar. [[H499]] Aaron [[H175]] will be gathered [to his people] [[H622]] and will die [[H4191]] there.” [[H8033]] 
27 So Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded, [[H6680]] and they climbed [[H5927]] Mount [[H2022]] Hor [[H2023]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the whole [[H3605]] congregation. [[H5712]] 
28 After Moses [[H4872]] had removed [[H6584]] Aaron’s [[H175]] garments [[H899]] and put them on [[H3847]] his son [[H1121]] Eleazar, [[H499]] Aaron [[H175]] died [[H4191]] there [[H8033]] on top [[H7218]] of the mountain. [[H2022]] Then Moses [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mountain. [[H2022]] 
29 When all the [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Aaron [[H175]] had died, [[H1478]] the entire [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] mourned [[H1058]] for him [[H175]] thirty [[H7970]] days. [[H3117]]
