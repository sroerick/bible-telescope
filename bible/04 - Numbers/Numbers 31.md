1 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Take vengeance [[H5358]] on [[H853]] the Midianites [[H4084]] for the Israelites. [[H1121]] After that, [[H310]] you will be gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] your people.” [[H5971]] 
3 So Moses [[H4872]] told [[H1696]] the people, [[H5971]] “Arm [[H2502]] some of your men [[H376]] for war, [[H6635]] that they may go [[H1961]] against [[H5921]] the Midianites [[H4080]] and execute [[H5414]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] vengeance [[H5360]] on them. [[H4080]] 
4 Send [[H7971]] into battle [[H6635]] a thousand men [[H505]] from each [[H3605]] tribe [[H4294]] of Israel.” [[H3478]] 
5 So a thousand men [[H505]] were recruited [[H4560]] from each tribe [[H4294]] of Israel— [[H3478]] twelve [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] armed [[H2502]] for war. [[H6635]] 
6 And Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] the thousand [[H505]] from each tribe [[H4294]] into battle, [[H6635]] along with [[H853]] Phinehas [[H6372]] son [[H1121]] of Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] who took with him [[H3027]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] and the trumpets [[H2689]] for signaling. [[H8643]] 
7 Then they waged war [[H6633]] against [[H5921]] Midian, [[H4080]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses, [[H4872]] and killed [[H2026]] every [[H3605]] male. [[H2145]] 
8 Along [[H5921]] with those who were slain, [[H2491]] they killed [[H2026]] the kings [[H4428]] of Midian— [[H4080]] Evi, [[H189]] Rekem, [[H7552]] Zur, [[H6698]] Hur, [[H2354]] and Reba— [[H7254]] the five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] of Midian. [[H4080]] They also killed [[H2026]] Balaam [[H1109]] son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] with the sword. [[H2719]] 
9 The Israelites [[H1121]] captured [[H7617]] the Midianite [[H4080]] women [[H802]] and their children, [[H2945]] and they plundered [[H962]] all [[H3605]] their herds, [[H929]] flocks, [[H4735]] and goods. [[H2428]] 
10 Then they burned [[H8313]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] where [the Midianites] had lived, [[H4186]] as well as all [[H3605]] their encampments, [[H2918]] 
11 and carried away [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the plunder [[H7998]] and [[H3605]] spoils, [[H4455]] both people [[H120]] and animals. [[H929]] 
12 They brought [[H935]] the captives, [[H7628]] spoils, [[H4455]] and plunder [[H7998]] to Moses, [[H4872]] to Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and to the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H1121]] at [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] on [[H413]] the plains [[H6160]] of Moab, [[H4124]] by [[H5921]] the Jordan [[H3383]] across from Jericho. [[H3405]] 
13 And Moses, [[H4872]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] went to meet them [[H3318]] outside [[H2351]] the camp. [[H4264]] 
14 But Moses [[H4872]] was angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] the officers [[H6485]] of the army— [[H2428]] the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds— [[H3967]] who were returning [[H935]] from [[H6635]] the battle. [[H4421]] 
15 “Have you spared [[H2421]] all [[H3605]] the women?” [[H5347]] he [[H4872]] asked them. [[H559]] 
16 “Look, [[H2005]] these women [[H2007]] {caused} the sons [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] through the counsel [[H1697]] of Balaam, [[H1109]] to turn [[H4560]] unfaithfully [[H4604]] against the LORD [[H3068]] at [[H5921]] Peor, [[H6465]] so that the plague [[H4046]] struck [[H1961]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
17 So now, [[H6258]] kill [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the boys, [[H2145]] and kill [[H2026]] every [[H3605]] woman [[H802]] who has had relations with [[H3045]] a man, [[H2145]] 
18 but spare [[H2421]] for yourselves  every [[H3605]] girl [[H2945]] who [[H834]] has never [[H3808]] had relations [[H3045]] with a man. [[H2145]] 
19 All of you [[H3605]] who have killed [[H2026]] a person [[H5315]] or touched [[H5060]] the dead [[H2491]] are to remain [[H2583]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] On the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] and the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] you are to purify [[H2398]] [both] yourselves [[H859]] and your captives. [[H7628]] 
20 And purify [[H2398]] every [[H3605]] garment [[H899]] and leather [[H5785]] good, [[H3627]] everything [[H4639]] made of goat’s hair, [[H5795]] and every [[H3605]] article [[H3627]] of wood.” [[H6086]] 
21 Then Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the soldiers [[H582]] who had gone [[H935]] into battle, [[H4421]] “This [[H2063]] is the statute [[H2708]] of the law [[H8451]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] has commanded [[H6680]] Moses: [[H4872]] 
22 Only [[H389]] the gold, [[H2091]] silver, [[H3701]] bronze, [[H5178]] iron, [[H1270]] tin, [[H913]] and lead— [[H5777]] 
23 everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] can withstand [[H935]] the fire— [[H784]] must be put [[H5674]] through the fire, [[H784]] and it will be clean. [[H2891]] But [[H389]] it must still be purified [[H2398]] with the water [[H4325]] of purification. [[H5079]] And everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] withstand [[H935]] the fire [[H784]] must pass [[H5674]] through the water. [[H4325]] 
24 On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] you are to wash [[H3526]] your clothes, [[H899]] and you will be clean. [[H2891]] After that [[H310]] you may enter [[H935]] the camp.” [[H4264]] 
25 The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
26 “You [[H859]] and Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] and the family [[H1]] heads [[H7218]] of the congregation [[H5712]] are to take a count [[H5375]] of what was captured, [[H7218]] [both] of man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]] 
27 Then divide [[H2673]] the captives [[H4455]] between [[H996]] the troops [[H8610]] who went out [[H3318]] to battle [[H6635]] and the rest of [[H3605]] the congregation. [[H5712]] 
28 Set aside [[H7311]] a tribute [[H4371]] for the LORD [[H3068]] from what belongs [[H4480]] to the soldiers [[H4421]] who went [[H3318]] into battle: [[H6635]] one [[H259]] out of [[H4480]] every five [[H2568]] hundred, [[H3967]] whether persons, [[H120]] cattle, [[H1241]] donkeys, [[H2543]] or sheep. [[H6629]] 
29 Take it [[H3947]] from their half [[H4276]] and give [[H5414]] it to Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] as an offering [[H8641]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
30 From [[H4480]] the Israelites’ [[H1121]] half, [[H4276]] take [[H3947]] one [[H259]] out of [[H4480]] every fifty, [[H2572]] whether persons, [[H120]] cattle, [[H1241]] donkeys, [[H2543]] sheep, [[H6629]] [or] other [[H3605]] animals, [[H929]] and give [[H5414]] them to the Levites [[H3881]] who keep [[H8104]] charge [[H4931]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
31 So Moses [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
32 [and] [[H1961]] this plunder [[H4455]] remained [[H3499]] from the spoils [[H957]] the soldiers [[H5971]] had taken: [[H962]] 675,000 [[H8337]] sheep, [[H6629]] 
33 72,000 [[H8147]] cattle, [[H1241]] 
34 61,000 [[H259]] donkeys, [[H2543]] 
35 and 32,000 [[H8147]] women [[H802]] who [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] slept with [[H3045]] a man. [[H2145]] 
36 This [was] the half [[H4275]] portion [[H2506]] for those who had gone [[H3318]] to war: [[H6635]] 337,500 [[H7969]] sheep [[H6629]] 
37 with a tribute [[H4371]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of 675, [[H8337]] 
38 36,000 [[H8337]] cattle [[H1241]] with a tribute [[H4371]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of 72, [[H8147]] 
39 30,500 [[H7970]] donkeys [[H2543]] with a tribute [[H4371]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of 61, [[H259]] 
40 and 16,000 [[H8337]] people [[H5315]] with a tribute [[H4371]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of 32. [[H8147]] 
41 Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H5414]] the tribute [[H4371]] to Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] as an offering [[H8641]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
42 From [[H4480]] the Israelites’ [[H1121]] half, [[H4276]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had set apart [[H2673]] from the men [[H376]] who had gone to war, [[H6633]] 
43 this half belonged to [[H4275]] the congregation: [[H5712]] 337,500 [[H7969]] sheep, [[H6629]] 
44 36,000 [[H8337]] cattle, [[H1241]] 
45 30,500 [[H7970]] donkeys, [[H2543]] 
46 and 16,000 [[H8337]] people. [[H5315]] 
47 From the Israelites’ [[H1121]] half, [[H4276]] Moses [[H4872]] took [[H270]] one [[H259]] out of [[H4480]] every fifty [[H2572]] persons [[H120]] and animals [[H929]] and gave [[H5414]] them [[H853]] to the Levites [[H3881]] who kept [[H8104]] charge [[H4931]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H4872]] 
48 Then the officers [[H6485]] who [[H834]] were over the units [[H505]] of the army— [[H6635]] the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and of hundreds— [[H3967]] approached [[H7126]] Moses [[H4872]] 
49 and said, [[H559]] “Your servants [[H5650]] have counted [[H5375]] the soldiers [[H4421]] under our command, [[H3027]] and not [[H3808]] one [[H376]] of us [[H4480]] is missing. [[H6485]] 
50 So we have brought [[H7126]] to the LORD [[H3068]] an offering [[H7133]] of the gold [[H2091]] articles [[H3627]] each man [[H376]] acquired— [[H4672]] armlets, [[H685]] bracelets, [[H6781]] rings, [[H2885]] earrings, [[H5694]] and necklaces— [[H3558]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] ourselves [[H5315]] before [[H6440]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
51 So Moses [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] received [[H3947]] from them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] made [[H4639]] of gold. [[H2091]] 
52 All [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] that the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and of hundreds [[H3967]] presented [[H7311]] as an offering [[H8641]] to the LORD [[H3068]] weighed 16,750 [[H8337]] shekels. [[H8255]] 
53 Each [[H376]] of the soldiers [[H376]] had taken plunder for himself. [[H962]] 
54 And Moses [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] received [[H3947]] the gold [[H2091]] from the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and of hundreds [[H3967]] and brought [[H935]] it into [[H413]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] as a memorial [[H2146]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] before [[H6440]] the LORD.
