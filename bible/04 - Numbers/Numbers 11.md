1 Soon [[H1961]] the people [[H5971]] began to complain [[H596]] about their hardship [[H7451]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and when He [[H3068]] heard [them], [[H8085]] His anger [[H639]] was kindled, [[H2734]] and fire [[H784]] from the LORD [[H3068]] blazed [[H1197]] among them  and consumed [[H398]] the outskirts [[H7097]] of the camp. [[H4264]] 
2 And the people [[H5971]] cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] and he [[H4872]] prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and the fire [[H784]] died down. [[H8257]] 
3 So that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] was called [[H7121]] Taberah, [[H8404]] because [[H3588]] the fire [[H784]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had burned [[H1197]] among them.  
4 Meanwhile, the rabble [[H628]] among them [[H7130]] had a strong craving for other food, [[H183]] and [[H1571]] again [[H7725]] the Israelites [[H1121]] wept [[H1058]] and said, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] will feed [[H398]] us meat? [[H1320]] 
5 We remember [[H2142]] the fish [[H1710]] we ate [[H398]] freely [[H2600]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] along with the cucumbers, [[H7180]] melons, [[H20]] leeks, [[H2682]] onions, [[H1211]] and garlic. [[H7762]] 
6 But now [[H6258]] our appetite [[H5315]] is gone; [[H3002]] there is nothing [[H369]] to see [[H5869]] but [[H1115]] this manna!” [[H4478]] 
7 Now the manna [[H4478]] resembled coriander [[H1407]] seed, [[H2233]] and its appearance [[H5869]] was like that [[H5869]] of gum resin. [[H916]] 
8 The people [[H5971]] walked around [[H7751]] and gathered it, [[H3950]] ground it [[H2912]] on a handmill [[H7347]] or [[H176]] crushed it [[H1743]] in a mortar, [[H4085]] then boiled [[H1310]] it in a cooking pot [[H6517]] or shaped it into [[H6213]] cakes. [[H5692]] It tasted [[H2940]] like pastry [[H3955]] baked with fine oil. [[H8081]] 
9 When the dew [[H2919]] fell [[H3381]] on [[H5921]] the camp [[H4264]] at night, [[H3915]] the manna [[H4478]] would fall [[H3381]] with it. [[H5921]] 
10 Then Moses [[H4872]] heard [[H8085]] the people [[H5971]] of family [[H4940]] after family [[H376]] weeping [[H1058]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of their tents, [[H168]] and the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3069]] was kindled [[H2734]] greatly, [[H3966]] and Moses [[H4872]] also was displeased. [[H5869]] 
11 So Moses [[H4872]] asked [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “Why [[H4100]] have You brought this trouble [[H7489]] on Your servant? [[H5650]] Why [[H4100]] have I not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in Your sight, [[H5869]] that You have laid [[H7760]] upon me [[H5921]] the burden [[H4853]] of all [[H3605]] these [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]] 
12 Did I [[H595]] conceive [[H2029]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]] Did I [[H595]] give them birth, [[H3205]] so that [[H3588]] You should tell [[H559]] me, [[H413]] ‘Carry them [[H5375]] in your bosom, [[H2436]] as [[H834]] a nurse [[H539]] carries [[H5375]] a nursing infant,’ [[H3243]] to [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] that [[H834]] You swore to give [[H7650]] their fathers? [[H1]] 
13 Where [[H370]] can I get meat [[H1320]] for [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]] For [[H3588]] they keep crying out [[H1058]] to me, [[H5921]] ‘Give [[H5414]] us meat [[H1320]] to eat!’ [[H398]] 
14 I [[H595]] cannot [[H3808]] carry [[H5375]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] by myself; [[H905]] [it is] too burdensome [[H3515]] for me. [[H4480]] 
15 If [[H518]] this is how [[H3602]] You [[H859]] are going to treat [[H6213]] me,  please [[H4994]] kill me right now— [[H2026]] if [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in Your eyes— [[H5869]] and let me not [[H408]] see [[H7200]] my own wretchedness.” [[H7451]] 
16 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to Moses, [[H4872]] “Bring [[H622]] Me  seventy [[H7657]] of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] known to you [[H3045]] as leaders [[H2205]] and officers [[H7860]] of the people. [[H5971]] Bring [[H3947]] them [[H853]] to [[H413]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and have them stand [[H3320]] there [[H8033]] with you. [[H5973]] 
17 And I will come down [[H3381]] and speak [[H1696]] with you [[H5973]] there, [[H8033]] and I will take [[H680]] some of [[H4480]] the Spirit [[H7307]] who [[H834]] is on [[H5921]] you and put [[H7760]] [that Spirit] upon them. [[H5921]] They will help you bear [[H5375]] the burden [[H4853]] of the people, [[H5971]] so that you [[H859]] do not [[H3808]] have to bear it [[H5375]] by yourself. [[H905]] 
18 And [[H413]] say [[H559]] to the people: [[H5971]] Consecrate yourselves [[H6942]] for tomorrow, [[H4279]] and you will eat [[H398]] meat, [[H1320]] because [[H3588]] you have cried out [[H1058]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Who [[H4310]] will feed [[H398]] us meat? [[H1320]] For [[H3588]] we were better off [[H2895]] in Egypt.’ [[H4714]] Therefore the LORD [[H3068]] will give [[H5414]] you meat, [[H1320]] and you will eat. [[H398]] 
19 You will eat it [[H398]] not [[H3808]] for one [[H259]] or two days, [[H3117]] nor [[H3808]] for five [[H2568]] or ten [[H6235]] or twenty [[H6242]] days, [[H3117]] 
20 but for [[H5704]] a whole month— [[H2320]] until [[H5704]] it comes out [[H3318]] of your nostrils [[H639]] and makes [[H1961]] you  nauseous— [[H2214]] because [[H3282]] you have despised [[H3988]] the LORD [[H3068]] who [[H834]] is among you, [[H7130]] and cried out [[H1058]] before Him [[H6440]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H4100]] did we ever [[H2088]] leave [[H3318]] Egypt?’” [[H4714]] 
21 But Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H559]] “Here I am [[H595]] among [[H7130]] 600,000 [[H8337]] men [[H5971]] on foot, [[H7273]] yet You [[H859]] say, [[H559]] ‘I will give [[H5414]] them meat, [[H1320]] and they will eat [[H398]] for a month.’ [[H2320]] 
22 If flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] were slaughtered for them, [[H7819]] would they have enough? [[H4672]] Or if [[H518]] all [[H3605]] the fish [[H1709]] in the sea [[H3220]] were caught for them, [[H622]] would they have enough?” [[H4672]] 
23 The LORD [[H3068]] answered [[H559]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Is the LORD’s [[H3068]] arm [[H3027]] too short? [[H7114]] Now [[H6258]] you will see [[H7200]] whether or [[H518]] not [[H3808]] My word [[H1697]] shall come to pass.” [[H7136]] 
24 So Moses [[H4872]] went out [[H3318]] and relayed [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] the words [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and he gathered [[H622]] seventy [[H7657]] of the elders [[H2205]] of the people [[H5971]] and had them stand [[H5975]] around [[H5439]] the tent. [[H168]] 
25 Then the LORD [[H3068]] came down [[H3381]] in the cloud [[H6051]] and spoke [[H1696]] to him, [[H413]] and He took [[H680]] some of [[H4480]] the Spirit [[H7307]] that [[H834]] was on [Moses] [[H5921]] and placed [[H5414]] that Spirit on [[H5921]] the seventy [[H7657]] elders. [[H2205]] As the Spirit [[H7307]] rested [[H5117]] on them, [[H5921]] they prophesied— [[H5012]] but they never [[H3808]] did so again. [[H3254]] 
26 Two [[H8147]] men, [[H376]] however, had remained [[H7604]] in the camp— [[H4264]] one [[H259]] named [[H8034]] Eldad [[H419]] and the other [[H8145]] Medad— [[H4312]] and the Spirit [[H7307]] rested [[H5117]] on them. [[H5921]] They [[H1992]] were among those listed, [[H3789]] but they had not [[H3808]] gone out [[H3318]] to the tent, [[H168]] and they prophesied [[H5012]] in the camp. [[H4264]] 
27 A young man [[H5288]] ran [[H7323]] and reported [[H5046]] to Moses, [[H4872]] “Eldad [[H419]] and Medad [[H4312]] are prophesying [[H5012]] in the camp.” [[H4264]] 
28 Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] the attendant [[H8334]] to Moses [[H4872]] since youth, [[H979]] spoke up [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] “Moses, [[H4872]] my lord, [[H113]] stop them!” [[H3607]] 
29 But Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H559]] “Are you [[H859]] jealous [[H7065]] on my account? [[H4310]] I wish that [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] people [[H5971]] were prophets [[H5030]] and that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] would place [[H5414]] His Spirit [[H7307]] on them!” [[H5921]] 
30 Then Moses [[H4872]] returned [[H622]] to [[H413]] the camp, [[H4264]] along with the elders [[H2205]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
31 Now a wind [[H7307]] sent by [[H4480]] the LORD [[H3068]] came up, [[H5265]] drove in [[H1468]] quail [[H7958]] from [[H853]] the sea, [[H3220]] and dropped [[H5203]] them near [[H5921]] the camp, [[H4264]] about two cubits [[H520]] deep [[H5921]] for a day’s [[H3117]] journey [[H1870]] in every direction [[H3541]] around [[H5439]] the camp. [[H4264]] 
32 All [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] and night, [[H3915]] and all [[H3605]] the next [[H4283]] day, [[H3117]] the people [[H5971]] stayed up [[H6965]] gathering [[H622]] the quail. [[H7958]] No one gathered [[H622]] less than [[H4591]] ten [[H6235]] homers, [[H2563]] and they spread them out [[H7849]] all around [[H5439]] the camp. [[H4264]] 
33 But while [[H5750]] the meat [[H1320]] was still between [[H996]] their teeth, [[H8127]] before [[H2962]] it was chewed, [[H3772]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against the people, [[H5971]] and the LORD [[H3068]] struck [[H5221]] them [[H5971]] with a severe [[H7227]] plague. [[H4347]] 
34 So they called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Kibroth-hattaavah, [[H6914]] because [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] they buried [[H6912]] the people [[H5971]] who had craved other food. [[H183]] 
35 From  Kibroth-hattaavah [[H6914]] the people [[H5971]] moved on [[H5265]] to Hazeroth, [[H2698]] where they remained for some time. [[H1961]]
