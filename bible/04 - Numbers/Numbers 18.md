# Numbers 18
[[Numbers 17|←]] • [[Numbers 19|→]]
1 The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] “You, [[H859]] your sons, [[H1121]] and your father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] must bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] against the sanctuary. [[H4720]] And you [[H859]] and your sons [[H1121]] [alone] [[H854]] must bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] against the priesthood. [[H3550]] 
2 But bring [[H7126]] with you [[H854]] also [[H1571]] your brothers [[H251]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Levi, [[H3878]] the tribe [[H7626]] of your father, [[H1]] that they may join [[H3867]] you [[H5921]] and assist [[H8334]] you [[H859]] and your sons [[H1121]] before [[H6440]] the Tent [[H168]] of the Testimony. [[H5715]] 
3 And they shall attend [[H8104]] to your duties [[H4931]] and all the duties [[H4931]] of the Tent; [[H168]] but [[H413]] they must not [[H3808]] come near [[H7126]] to the furnishings [[H3627]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] or the altar, [[H4196]] or [[H3808]] both [[H1571]] they [[H1992]] and [[H1571]] you [[H859]] will die. [[H4191]] 
4 They are to join [[H3867]] you [[H5921]] and attend [[H8104]] to the obligations [[H4931]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] doing all [[H3605]] the work [[H5656]] at the Tent; [[H168]] but no [[H3808]] outsider [[H2114]] may come near [[H7126]] you. [[H413]] 
5 So you shall attend [[H8104]] to the obligations [[H4931]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] [and] [[H4931]] of the altar, [[H4196]] that wrath [[H7110]] may not [[H3808]] fall [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the Israelites [[H1121]] again. [[H5750]] 
6 Behold, [[H2009]] I Myself [[H589]] have selected [[H3947]] your fellow [[H251]] Levites [[H3881]] from [[H8432]] the Israelites [[H1121]] as a gift [[H4979]] to you,  dedicated [[H5414]] to the LORD [[H3068]] to perform [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] for the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
7 But only you [[H859]] and your sons [[H1121]] shall attend [[H8104]] to your priesthood [[H3550]] for everything [[H3605]] concerning [[H1697]] the altar, [[H4196]] and for what is inside [[H1004]] the veil, [[H6532]] and you are to perform that service. [[H5647]] I am giving [[H5414]] you the work [[H5656]] of the priesthood [[H3550]] as a gift, [[H4979]] but any outsider [[H2114]] who comes near [the sanctuary] [[H7126]] must be put to death.” [[H4191]] 
8 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] have put [[H5414]] you in charge [[H4931]] of My offerings. [[H8641]] As for all [[H3605]] the sacred offerings [[H6918]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] I have given them [[H5414]] to you  and your sons [[H1121]] as a portion [[H4888]] and a permanent [[H5769]] statute. [[H2706]] 
9 A portion of [[H4480]] the most holy offerings [[H6944]] [reserved] from the fire [[H784]] will be yours. [[H1961]] From all [[H3605]] the offerings [[H7133]] that [[H834]] they give Me, [[H7725]] whether grain offerings, [[H4503]] sin offerings, [[H2403]] or guilt offerings, [[H817]] it shall be most holy [[H6944]] to you and your sons. [[H1121]] 
10 You are to eat [[H398]] it as most holy. [[H6944]] Every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] may eat it; [[H398]] it shall be [[H1961]] holy [[H6944]] to you.  
11 And this [[H2088]] is yours as well:  the offering [[H8641]] of their gifts, [[H4976]] along with all [[H3605]] the wave offerings [[H8573]] of the Israelites. [[H1121]] I have given this [[H5414]] to you  and your sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] as a permanent [[H5769]] statute. [[H2706]] Every [[H3605]] ceremonially clean person [[H2889]] in your household [[H1004]] may eat it. [[H398]] 
12 I give you [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the freshest [[H2459]] olive oil [[H3323]] and all [[H3605]] the finest [[H2459]] new wine [[H8492]] and grain [[H1715]] that [[H834]] the Israelites give [[H5414]] to the LORD [[H3068]] as their firstfruits. [[H7225]] 
13 The firstfruits [[H1061]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] is in their land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] they bring [[H935]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] belong [[H1961]] to you.  Every [[H3605]] ceremonially clean person [[H2889]] in your household [[H1004]] may eat them. [[H398]] 
14 Every [[H3605]] devoted thing [[H2764]] in Israel [[H3478]] belongs to you. [[H1961]] 
15 The firstborn [[H6363]] of every [[H3605]] womb, [[H1320]] whether [[H834]] man [[H120]] or beast, [[H929]] that is offered [[H7126]] to the LORD [[H3068]] belongs to you. [[H1961]] But [[H389]] you must surely redeem [[H6299]] every firstborn [[H1060]] son [[H120]] [and] [[H6299]] every firstborn male [[H1060]] of unclean [[H2931]] animals. [[H929]] 
16 You are to pay the redemption price [[H6299]] for a month-old male [[H1121]] according to your valuation: [[H6187]] five [[H2568]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver, [[H3701]] according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel, [[H8255]] which [[H1931]] is twenty [[H6242]] gerahs. [[H1626]] 
17 But [[H389]] you must not [[H3808]] redeem [[H6299]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of an ox, [[H7794]] a sheep, [[H3775]] or [[H176]] a goat; [[H5795]] they [[H1992]] are holy. [[H6944]] You are to sprinkle [[H2236]] their blood [[H1818]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] and burn [[H6999]] their fat [[H2459]] as an offering made by fire, [[H801]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
18 And their meat [[H1320]] belongs to you, [[H1961]] just as the breast [[H2373]] and right [[H3225]] thigh [[H7785]] of the wave offering [[H8573]] belong to you. [[H1961]] 
19 All [[H3605]] the holy [[H6944]] offerings [[H8641]] that [[H834]] the Israelites [[H3478]] present [[H7311]] to the LORD [[H3068]] I give [[H5414]] to you  and to your sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] as a permanent [[H5769]] statute. [[H2706]] It [[H1931]] is a permanent [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] of salt [[H4417]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] for you and your offspring.” [[H2233]] 
20 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to Aaron, [[H175]] “You will have no [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5157]] in their land, [[H776]] nor [[H3808]] will you have [[H1961]] any portion [[H2506]] among them. [[H8432]] I [[H589]] am your portion [[H2506]] and your inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
21 Behold, [[H2009]] I have given [[H5414]] to the Levites [[H1121]] all [[H3605]] the tithes [[H4643]] in Israel [[H3478]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] in return for [[H2500]] the work [[H5656]] they [[H1992]] do, [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
22 No [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] may the Israelites [[H1121]] come [[H413]] near [[H7126]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] or they will incur [[H5375]] guilt [[H2399]] and die. [[H4191]] 
23 The Levites [[H3881]] are to perform [[H5647]] the work [[H5656]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and they [[H1992]] must bear [[H5375]] their iniquity. [[H5771]] This is a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] The Levites will not [[H3808]] receive an inheritance [[H5157]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
24 For [[H3588]] I have given [[H5414]] the Levites [[H3881]] as their inheritance [[H5159]] the tenth [[H4643]] that [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] present [[H7311]] to the LORD [[H3068]] as a contribution. [[H8641]] That is why [[H5921]] I told [[H559]] them that they would not [[H3808]] receive an inheritance [[H5157]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites.” [[H1121]] 
25 And the LORD [[H3068]] instructed [[H1696]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
26 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Levites [[H3881]] and tell them: [[H559]] When [[H3588]] you receive [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] the Israelites [[H1121]] the tithe [[H4643]] that [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] you  as your inheritance, [[H5159]] you must present [[H7311]] part of [[H4480]] it as an offering [[H8641]] to the LORD— [[H3068]] a tenth [[H4643]] of the tenth. [[H4643]] 
27 Your offering [[H8641]] will be reckoned [[H2803]] to you  as grain [[H1715]] from [[H4480]] the threshing floor [[H1637]] or juice [[H4395]] from [[H4480]] the winepress. [[H3342]] 
28 So [[H3651]] you [[H859]] are to present [[H7311]] an offering [[H8641]] to the LORD [[H3068]] from every [[H3605]] tenth [[H4643]] you receive [[H3947]] from the Israelites, [[H1121]] and from it [[H4480]] give [[H5414]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] offering [[H8641]] to Aaron [[H175]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
29 You must present [[H7311]] the offering [[H8641]] due the LORD [[H3068]] from [[H3605]] all [[H3605]] the best [[H2459]] of every [[H3605]] gift, [[H4979]] the holiest part [[H4720]] of it. [[H4480]] 
30 Therefore say [[H559]] to [the Levites]: [[H413]] Once you have presented [[H7311]] the best part, [[H2459]] it will be reckoned [[H2803]] [to you] [[H3881]] as the produce [[H8393]] of the threshing floor [[H1637]] or the winepress. [[H3342]] 
31 And you [[H859]] and your households [[H1004]] may eat [the rest of it] anywhere; [[H398]] it [[H1931]] is the compensation [[H7939]] for [[H2500]] your work [[H5656]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
32 Once you have presented [[H7311]] the best part [[H2459]] of it, [[H4480]] you will not [[H3808]] incur [[H5375]] guilt [[H2399]] because of it. [[H5921]] But [[H853]] you must not [[H3808]] defile [[H2490]] the sacred offerings [[H6918]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] lest [[H3808]] you die.” [[H4191]]
