1 Now Korah [[H7141]] son [[H1121]] of Izhar, [[H3324]] the son [[H1121]] of Kohath [[H6955]] son [[H1121]] of Levi, [[H3878]] along with some Reubenites— [[H7205]] Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram, [[H48]] sons [[H1121]] of Eliab, [[H446]] and On [[H203]] son [[H1121]] of Peleth— [[H6431]] conducted [[H3947]] 
2 a rebellion [[H6965]] against [[H6440]] Moses, [[H4872]] along with 250 [[H2572]] men [[H582]] of Israel [[H3478]] renowned [[H8034]] as leaders [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] and representatives [[H7148]] in the assembly. [[H4150]] 
3 They came together [[H6950]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and [[H5921]] Aaron [[H175]] and told them, [[H559]] “You have gone too far! [[H7227]] Everyone [[H3605]] in the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] is holy, [[H6918]] and the LORD [[H3068]] is in their midst. [[H8432]] Why [[H4069]] then do you exalt [[H5375]] yourselves above [[H5921]] the assembly [[H6951]] of the LORD?” [[H3068]] 
4 When Moses [[H4872]] heard this, [[H8085]] he fell [[H5307]] facedown. [[H5921]] 
5 Then he said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Korah [[H7141]] and all [[H3605]] his followers, [[H5712]] “Tomorrow morning [[H1242]] the LORD [[H3068]] will reveal [[H3045]] who belongs [[H834]] to Him  and [[H853]] who is holy, [[H6918]] and He will bring that person near [[H7126]] to Himself. [[H413]] The one [[H834]] He chooses [[H977]] He will bring near [[H7126]] to Himself. [[H413]] 
6 You, Korah, [[H7141]] and all [[H3605]] your followers [[H5712]] are to do [[H6213]] as follows: [[H2063]] Take [[H3947]] censers, [[H4289]] 
7 and tomorrow [[H4279]] you are to place [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] and incense [[H7004]] in them [[H2004]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Then the man [[H376]] the LORD [[H3068]] chooses [[H977]] will be [[H1961]] the one [[H1931]] who is holy. [[H6918]] It is you sons [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3878]] who have gone too far!” [[H7227]] 
8 Moses [[H4872]] also said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Korah, [[H7141]] “Now [[H4994]] listen, [[H8085]] you sons [[H1121]] of Levi! [[H3878]] 
9 Is it not enough [[H4592]] for [[H4480]] you that [[H3588]] the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] has separated you [[H914]] from the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] and brought you near [[H7126]] to Himself [[H413]] to perform [[H5647]] the work [[H5656]] at the LORD’s [[H3068]] tabernacle [[H4908]] and to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the congregation [[H5712]] to minister to them? [[H8334]] 
10 He has brought you near, [[H7126]] [you] and all [[H3605]] your fellow [[H251]] Levites, [[H1121]] but you are seeking [[H1245]] the priesthood [[H3550]] as well. [[H1571]] 
11 Therefore, [[H3651]] it is you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] your followers [[H5712]] who have conspired [[H3259]] against [[H5921]] the LORD! [[H3068]] As for Aaron, [[H175]] who [[H4100]] is he [[H1931]] that [[H3588]] you should grumble [[H3885]] against him?” [[H5921]] 
12 Then Moses [[H4872]] summoned [[H7971]] Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram, [[H48]] the sons [[H1121]] of Eliab, [[H446]] but they said, [[H559]] “We will not [[H3808]] come! [[H5927]] 
13 Is it not enough [[H4592]] that [[H3588]] you have brought us up [[H5927]] out of a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey [[H1706]] to kill [[H4191]] us in the wilderness? [[H4057]] Must you also [[H1571]] appoint yourself as ruler [[H8323]] over us? [[H5921]] 
14 Moreover, [[H637]] you have not [[H3808]] brought us [[H935]] into [[H413]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey [[H1706]] or given [[H5414]] us an inheritance [[H5159]] of fields [[H7704]] and vineyards. [[H3754]] Will you gouge out [[H5365]] the eyes [[H5869]] of these [[H1992]] men? [[H376]] No, we will not [[H3808]] come!” [[H5927]] 
15 Then Moses [[H4872]] became very [[H3966]] angry [[H2734]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “Do not [[H408]] regard [[H6437]] their offering. [[H4503]] I have not [[H3808]] taken [[H5375]] one [[H259]] donkey [[H2543]] from them [[H1992]] or mistreated [[H7489]] a single [[H259]] one of them.” [[H1992]] 
16 So Moses [[H4872]] told [[H559]] Korah, [[H7141]] “You [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] your followers [[H5712]] are to appear [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] tomorrow— [[H4279]] you [[H859]] and they [[H1992]] and Aaron. [[H175]] 
17 Each man [[H376]] is to take [[H3947]] his censer, [[H4289]] place [[H5414]] incense [[H7004]] in it, [[H5921]] and present [[H7126]] [it] [[H4289]] before [[H6440]] the LORD— [[H3068]] 250 [[H2572]] censers [in all]. [[H4289]] You [[H859]] and Aaron [[H175]] are to present your censers as well.” [[H4289]] 
18 So each man [[H376]] took [[H3947]] his censer, [[H4289]] put [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] and incense [[H7004]] in it, [[H5921]] and stood [[H5975]] with Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
19 When Korah [[H7141]] had gathered [[H6950]] his whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H5712]] against [[H5921]] them at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation. [[H5712]] 
20 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
21 “Separate yourselves [[H914]] from [[H8432]] this [[H2063]] congregation [[H5712]] so that I may consume [[H3615]] them [[H853]] in an instant.” [[H7281]] 
22 But Moses and Aaron fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H5921]] and said, [[H559]] “O God, [[H410]] the God [[H430]] of the spirits [[H7307]] of all [[H3605]] flesh, [[H1320]] when one [[H259]] man [[H376]] sins, [[H2398]] will You vent Your wrath [[H7107]] on [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation?” [[H5712]] 
23 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
24 “Tell [[H1696]] the congregation [[H5712]] to move away [[H5927]] from [[H5439]] the dwellings [[H4908]] of Korah, [[H7141]] Dathan, [[H1885]] and Abiram.” [[H48]] 
25 So Moses [[H4872]] got up [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram, [[H48]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] followed [[H1980]] him. [[H310]] 
26 And he warned [[H1696]] the congregation, [[H5712]] “Move away [[H5493]] now [[H4994]] from [[H5921]] the tents [[H168]] of these [[H428]] wicked [[H7563]] men. [[H376]] Do not [[H408]] touch [[H5060]] anything [[H3605]] that belongs to them, [[H834]] or [[H6435]] you will be swept away [[H5595]] because of all [[H3605]] their sins.” [[H2403]] 
27 So they moved away [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] the dwellings [[H4908]] of Korah, [[H7141]] Dathan, [[H1885]] and Abiram. [[H48]] Meanwhile, [[H5439]] Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram [[H48]] had come out [[H3318]] and stood [[H5324]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of their tents [[H168]] with their wives [[H802]] and children [[H1121]] and infants. [[H2945]] 
28 Then Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] “This is how [[H2063]] you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has sent me [[H7971]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things, [[H4639]] for [[H3588]] it was not [[H3808]] my own doing: [[H3820]] 
29 If [[H518]] these [[H428]] men die [[H4191]] a natural death, [[H4194]] or if they suffer [[H6485]] the fate [[H6486]] of all [[H3605]] men, [[H120]] then the LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] sent me. [[H7971]] 
30 But if [[H518]] the LORD [[H3068]] brings about [[H1254]] something unprecedented, [[H1278]] and the earth [[H127]] opens [[H6475]] its mouth [[H6310]] and swallows [[H1104]] them [[H853]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] belongs to them  so that they go down [[H3381]] alive [[H2416]] into Sheol, [[H7585]] then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] have treated [[H5006]] the LORD {with contempt}. [[H3068]] 
31 As soon as [Moses] had finished [[H3615]] saying [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] this, [[H428]] the ground [[H127]] beneath them [[H8478]] split open, [[H1234]] 
32 and the earth [[H776]] opened [[H6605]] its mouth [[H6310]] and swallowed [[H1104]] them [[H853]] and [[H853]] their households, [[H1004]] all [[H3605]] Korah’s [[H7141]] men [[H120]] and all [[H3605]] their possessions. [[H7399]] 
33 They [[H1992]] went down [[H3381]] alive [[H2416]] into Sheol [[H7585]] with all [[H3605]] they owned. [[H834]] The earth [[H776]] closed [[H3680]] over them, [[H5921]] and they vanished [[H6]] from [[H8432]] the assembly. [[H6951]] 
34 At their cries, [[H6963]] all [[H3605]] the people of Israel [[H3478]] who [were] [[H834]] around them [[H5439]] fled, [[H5127]] saying, [[H559]] “The earth [[H776]] may [[H6435]] swallow us too!” [[H1104]] 
35 And fire [[H784]] came forth [[H3318]] from the LORD [[H3068]] and consumed [[H398]] the 250 [[H2572]] men [[H376]] who were offering [[H7126]] the incense. [[H7004]] 
36 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
37 “Tell [[H559]] Eleazar [[H499]] son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] to remove [[H7311]] the censers [[H4289]] from [[H996]] the flames, [[H8316]] because [[H3588]] they are holy, [[H6942]] and to scatter [[H2219]] the coals [[H784]] far away. [[H1973]] 
38 As for the censers [[H4289]] of those [[H428]] who sinned [[H2400]] at the cost of their own lives, [[H5315]] hammer them into [[H7555]] sheets [[H6341]] to overlay [[H6826]] the altar, [[H4196]] for [[H3588]] these were presented [[H7126]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and so have become holy. [[H6942]] They will serve as [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] to the Israelites.” [[H1121]] 
39 So Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] took [[H3947]] the bronze [[H5178]] censers [[H4289]] brought [[H7126]] by those who had been burned up, [[H8313]] and he had them hammered out [[H7554]] to overlay [[H6826]] the altar, [[H4196]] 
40 just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H1696]] him through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]] This was to be a reminder [[H2146]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] that [[H4616]] no [[H3808]] outsider [[H2114]] who is not [[H3808]] a descendant [[H2233]] of Aaron [[H175]] should approach [[H7126]] to offer [[H6999]] incense [[H7004]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] lest he become [[H1961]] like Korah [[H7141]] and his followers. [[H5712]] 
41 The next day [[H4283]] the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] grumbled [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] saying, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] have killed [[H4191]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] people!” [[H5971]] 
42 But [[H1961]] when the congregation [[H5712]] gathered [[H6950]] against them, [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] turned [[H6437]] toward [[H413]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and suddenly the cloud [[H6051]] covered it [[H3680]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] appeared. [[H7200]] 
43 Then Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the front [[H6440]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] 
44 and the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
45 “Get away [[H7426]] from [[H8432]] this [[H2063]] congregation [[H5712]] so that I may consume [[H3615]] them [[H853]] in an instant.” [[H7281]] And they fell [[H5307]] facedown. [[H5921]] 
46 Moses [[H4872]] said to [[H559]] Aaron, [[H175]] “Take [[H3947]] your censer, [[H4289]] place [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] from [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] in it, [[H5921]] and add incense. [[H7004]] Go [[H1980]] quickly [[H4120]] to [[H413]] the congregation [[H5712]] and make atonement [[H3722]] for them, [[H5921]] because [[H3588]] wrath [[H7110]] has come [[H3318]] out from [[H6440]] the LORD; [[H3068]] the plague [[H5063]] has begun. [[H2490]] 
47 So Aaron [[H175]] took [the censer] [[H3947]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had ordered [[H1696]] and ran [[H7323]] into [[H413]] the middle [[H8432]] of the assembly. [[H6951]] And seeing that the plague [[H5063]] had begun [[H2490]] among the people, [[H5971]] he offered the incense [[H7004]] and made atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the people. [[H5971]] 
48 He stood [[H5975]] between [[H996]] the living [[H2416]] and the dead, [[H4191]] and the plague [[H4046]] was halted. [[H6113]] 
49 But those who died [[H4191]] from the plague [[H4046]] numbered 14,700, [[H702]] in addition to [[H905]] those who had died [[H4191]] on account [[H5921]] of Korah. [[H7141]] 
50 Then Aaron [[H175]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] since the plague [[H4046]] had been halted. [[H6113]]
