1 On the day [[H3117]] Moses [[H4872]] finished [[H3615]] setting up [[H6965]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] he anointed [[H4886]] and consecrated [[H6942]] it [[H853]] and all [[H3605]] its furnishings, [[H3627]] along with the altar [[H4196]] and all [[H3605]] its utensils. [[H3627]] 
2 And the leaders [[H5387]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the heads [[H7218]] of their families, [[H1]] presented an offering. [[H7126]] These [men] [[H1992]] were the tribal [[H4294]] leaders [[H5387]] who had supervised [[H5975]] the registration. [[H6485]] 
3 They brought [[H935]] as their offering [[H7133]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] six [[H8337]] covered [[H6632]] carts [[H5699]] and twelve [[H8147]] oxen— [[H1241]] an ox [[H7794]] from each [leader] [[H259]] and a cart [[H5699]] from [[H5921]] every two [[H8147]] leaders— [[H5387]] and presented [[H7126]] them [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the tabernacle. [[H4908]] 
4 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
5 “Accept these [gifts] [[H3947]] from them, [[H853]] that they may be [[H1961]] used [[H5647]] in the work [[H5656]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] And give [[H5414]] them [[H853]] to [[H413]] the Levites, [[H3881]] to every man [[H376]] according to [[H6310]] his service.” [[H5656]] 
6 So Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the carts [[H5699]] and oxen [[H1241]] and gave [[H5414]] them to [[H413]] the Levites. [[H3881]] 
7 He gave [[H5414]] the Gershonites [[H1121]] two [[H8147]] carts [[H5699]] and four [[H702]] oxen, [[H1241]] as their service [[H5656]] required, [[H6310]] 
8 and [[H853]] he gave [[H5414]] the Merarites [[H1121]] four [[H702]] carts [[H5699]] and eight [[H8083]] oxen, [[H1241]] as their service [[H5656]] required, [[H6310]] all under the direction [[H3027]] of Ithamar [[H385]] son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
9 But he did not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] any to the Kohathites, [[H1121]] since [[H3588]] they were to carry [[H5375]] on their [[H5921]] shoulders [[H3802]] the holy objects [[H6944]] for which they were responsible. [[H5656]] 
10 When [[H3117]] [the altar] was anointed, [[H4886]] the leaders [[H5387]] approached [[H7126]] with their offerings [[H7133]] for [its] dedication [[H2598]] [and] [[H5387]] presented them [[H7126]] before [[H6440]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
11 And the LORD said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Each day [[H3117]] one [[H259]] leader [[H5387]] is to present [[H7126]] his offering [[H7133]] for the dedication [[H2598]] of the altar.” [[H4196]] 
12 On the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] Nahshon [[H5177]] son [[H1121]] of Amminadab [[H5992]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah [[H3063]] drew near [[H7126]] with his offering. [[H7133]]
