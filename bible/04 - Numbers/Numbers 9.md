[[Numbers 8|←]] • [[Numbers 10|→]]
1 In the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] of the second [[H8145]] year [[H8141]] after [Israel] had come out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to Moses [[H4872]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai: [[H5514]] 
2 “The Israelites [[H1121]] are to observe [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] at its appointed time. [[H4150]] 
3 You are to observe [[H6213]] it [[H853]] at the appointed time, [[H4150]] at [[H996]] twilight [[H6153]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of this [[H2088]] month, [[H2320]] in accordance with [[H3605]] its statutes [[H2708]] and ordinances.” [[H4941]] 
4 So Moses [[H4872]] told [[H1696]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to observe [[H6213]] the Passover, [[H6453]] 
5 and they [did so] [[H6213]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai, [[H5514]] at [[H996]] twilight [[H6153]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month. [[H2320]] The Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
6 But there were [[H1961]] some men [[H582]] who [[H834]] were [[H1961]] unclean [[H2931]] due to a dead body, [[H120]] so they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] observe [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] on that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]] And they came [[H7126]] before [[H6440]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] that same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] 
7 and said [[H559]] to [Moses], [[H413]] “We [[H587]] are unclean [[H2931]] because of a dead body, [[H120]] but why [[H4100]] should we be excluded [[H1639]] from [[H1115]] presenting [[H7126]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] offering [[H7133]] with [[H8432]] the other Israelites [[H1121]] at the appointed time?” [[H4150]] 
8 “Wait here [[H5975]] until I hear [[H8085]] what [[H4100]] the LORD [[H3068]] commands concerning you,” [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] replied. [[H559]] 
9 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
10 “Tell [[H1696]] the Israelites: [[H1121]] When [[H3588]] any one [[H376]] of you or [[H176]] your descendants [[H1755]] is [[H1961]] unclean [[H2931]] because of a dead body, [[H5315]] or [[H176]] is away [[H7350]] on a journey, [[H1870]] he may still observe [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 Such people are to observe [[H6213]] it [[H853]] at [[H996]] twilight [[H6153]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the second [[H8145]] month. [[H2320]] They are to eat [the lamb], [[H398]] together with [[H5921]] unleavened bread [[H4682]] and bitter herbs; [[H4844]] 
12 they may not [[H3808]] leave [[H7604]] any of [[H4480]] it until [[H5704]] morning [[H1242]] or break [[H7665]] any of its bones. [[H6106]] They must observe [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] according to all [[H3605]] its statutes. [[H2708]] 
13 But the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] is ceremonially clean, [[H2889]] is [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] on a journey, [[H1870]] and still fails [[H2308]] to observe [[H6213]] the Passover, [[H6453]] is to be cut off [[H3772]] from his people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] he did not [[H3808]] present [[H7126]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] offering [[H7133]] at its appointed time. [[H4150]] That [[H1931]] man [[H376]] will bear [[H5375]] the consequences of his sin. [[H2399]] 
14 If [[H3588]] a foreigner [[H1616]] dwelling [[H1481]] among you [[H854]] wants to observe [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] he is to do [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] according to the Passover [[H6453]] statute [[H2708]] and its ordinances. [[H4941]] You are to apply [[H1961]] the same [[H259]] statute [[H2708]] to both the foreigner [[H1616]] and the native [[H249]] of the land.” [[H776]] 
15 On the day that [[H3117]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the Tent [[H168]] of the Testimony, [[H5715]] was set up, [[H6965]] the cloud [[H6051]] covered [[H3680]] [it] [[H4908]] and appeared [[H4758]] like fire [[H784]] above [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] from evening [[H6153]] until [[H5704]] morning. [[H1242]] 
16 It remained [[H1961]] that way [[H3651]] continually; [[H8548]] the cloud [[H6051]] would cover [the tabernacle] [by day], [[H3680]] and at night [[H3915]] it would appear [[H4758]] like fire. [[H784]] 
17 Whenever [[H6310]] the cloud [[H6051]] was taken up [[H5927]] from above [[H5921]] the Tent, [[H168]] the Israelites [[H1121]] would set out, [[H5265]] and wherever [[H4725]] the cloud [[H6051]] settled, [[H7931]] there [[H8033]] the Israelites [[H1121]] would camp. [[H2583]] 
18 At [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command [[H6310]] the Israelites [[H1121]] set out, [[H5265]] and at [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command [[H6310]] they camped. [[H2583]] As long as [[H3605]] the cloud [[H6051]] remained [[H7931]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] they camped. [[H2583]] 
19 Even when the cloud [[H6051]] lingered [[H748]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] for many [[H7227]] days, [[H3117]] the Israelites [[H1121]] kept [[H8104]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] charge [[H4931]] and did not [[H3808]] set out. [[H5265]] 
20 Sometimes [[H3426]] the cloud [[H6051]] remained [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] for only a few [[H4557]] days, [[H3117]] and they would camp [[H2583]] at [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command [[H6310]] and set out [[H5265]] at [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command. [[H6310]] 
21 Sometimes [[H3426]] the cloud [[H6051]] remained [[H1961]] only from evening [[H6153]] until [[H5704]] morning, [[H1242]] and when [it] [[H6051]] lifted [[H5927]] in the morning, [[H1242]] they would set out. [[H5265]] Whether [[H176]] [it was] by day [[H3119]] or by night, [[H3915]] when the cloud [[H6051]] was taken up, [[H5927]] they would set out. [[H5265]] 
22 Whether [[H176]] [the cloud] lingered [[H748]] for two days, [[H3117]] a month, [[H2320]] or longer, [[H176]] the Israelites [[H1121]] camped [[H2583]] and did not [[H3808]] set out [[H5265]] as long as the cloud [[H6051]] remained [[H7931]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle; [[H4908]] but when it was lifted, [[H5927]] they would set out. [[H5265]] 
23 They camped [[H2583]] at [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command, [[H6310]] and they set out [[H5265]] at [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command; [[H6310]] they carried out [[H8104]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] charge [[H4931]] according to [[H5921]] His [[H3068]] command [[H6310]] through [[H3027]] Moses.
