1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
2 “Take a census [[H5375]] of the Kohathites [[H6955]] among [[H8432]] the Levites [[H3881]] by their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] 
3 men from thirty [[H7970]] to [[H5704]] fifty [[H2572]] years old— [[H1121]] everyone [[H3605]] who is qualified [[H935]] to serve [[H6635]] in the work [[H4399]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
4 This [[H2063]] service [[H5656]] of the Kohathites [[H1121]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] regards the most [[H6944]] holy things. [[H6944]] 
5 Whenever the camp [[H4264]] sets out, [[H5265]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] are to go in, [[H935]] take down [[H3381]] the veil [[H6532]] of the curtain, [[H4539]] and cover [[H3680]] the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] with it.  
6 They are to place [[H5414]] over [[H5921]] this a covering [[H3681]] of fine leather, [[H8476]] spread [[H6566]] a solid [[H3632]] blue [[H8504]] cloth [[H899]] over it, [[H4605]] and insert [[H7760]] its poles. [[H905]] 
7 Over [[H5921]] the table [[H7979]] of the Presence [[H6440]] they are to spread [[H6566]] a blue [[H8504]] cloth [[H899]] and place [[H5414]] the plates [[H7086]] and cups [[H3709]] on it, [[H5921]] along with [[H853]] the bowls [[H4518]] and pitchers [[H7184]] for the drink offering. [[H5262]] The regular [[H8548]] bread [[H3899]] offering is to remain [[H1961]] on it. [[H5921]] 
8 And they shall spread [[H6566]] a scarlet [[H8438]] cloth [[H899]] over them, [[H5921]] cover [[H3680]] them [[H853]] with [[H4372]] fine leather, [[H8476]] and insert [[H7760]] the poles. [[H905]] 
9 They are to take [[H3947]] a blue [[H8504]] cloth [[H899]] and cover [[H3680]] the lampstand [[H4501]] used for light, [[H3974]] together [[H853]] with its lamps, [[H5216]] wick trimmers, [[H4457]] and trays, [[H4289]] as well as the jars [[H3627]] of oil [[H8081]] with which [[H834]] to service it. [[H8334]] 
10 Then they shall place [[H5414]] it [[H853]] with all [[H3605]] its utensils [[H3627]] inside [[H413]] a covering [[H4372]] of fine leather [[H8476]] and put [[H5414]] [it] on [[H5921]] the carrying frame. [[H4132]] 
11 Over [[H5921]] the gold [[H2091]] altar [[H4196]] they are to spread [[H6566]] a blue [[H8504]] cloth, [[H899]] cover [[H3680]] it [[H853]] with [[H4372]] fine leather, [[H8476]] and insert [[H7760]] the poles. [[H905]] 
12 They are to take [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the utensils [[H3627]] for serving [[H8335]] in the sanctuary, [[H6944]] place [[H5414]] them in [[H413]] a blue [[H8504]] cloth, [[H899]] cover [[H3680]] them [[H853]] with [[H4372]] fine leather, [[H8476]] and put [[H5414]] them on [[H5921]] a carrying frame. [[H4132]] 
13 Then they shall remove the ashes [[H1878]] from the bronze altar, [[H4196]] spread [[H6566]] a purple [[H713]] cloth [[H899]] over it, [[H5921]] 
14 and place [[H5414]] on it [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] used to serve [[H8334]] there: [[H5921]] the firepans, [[H4289]] meat forks, [[H4207]] shovels, [[H3257]] and basins— [[H4219]] all [[H3605]] the equipment [[H3627]] of the altar. [[H4196]] They are to spread [[H6566]] over it [[H5921]] a covering [[H3681]] of fine leather [[H8476]] and insert [[H7760]] the poles. [[H905]] 
15 When Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] have finished [[H3615]] covering [[H3680]] the holy objects [[H6944]] and all [[H3605]] their equipment, [[H3627]] as soon as the camp [[H4264]] is ready to move, [[H5265]] the Kohathites [[H1121]] shall come [[H935]] and do the carrying. [[H5375]] But they must not [[H3808]] touch [[H5060]] the holy objects, [[H6944]] or they will die. [[H4191]] These [[H428]] are the transportation duties [[H4853]] of the Kohathites [[H1121]] regarding the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
16 Eleazar [[H499]] son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] shall oversee [[H6486]] the oil [[H8081]] for the light, [[H3974]] the fragrant [[H5561]] incense, [[H7004]] the daily [[H8548]] grain offering, [[H4503]] and the anointing [[H4888]] oil. [[H8081]] He has oversight [[H6486]] of the entire [[H3605]] tabernacle [[H4908]] and everything [[H3605]] in it,  including the holy objects [[H6944]] and their utensils. [[H3627]] 
17 Then the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
18 “Do not [[H408]] allow the Kohathite [[H6956]] tribal [[H7626]] clans [[H4940]] to be cut off [[H3772]] from among [[H8432]] the Levites. [[H3881]] 
19 In order that they may live [[H2421]] and not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] when they come near [[H5066]] the most [[H6944]] holy things, [[H6944]] do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] for them:  Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] are to go in [[H935]] and assign [[H7760]] each man [[H376]] his task [[H5656]] and what he is to carry. [[H4853]] 
20 But [the Kohathites] are not [[H3808]] to go in [[H935]] and look [[H7200]] at the holy objects, [[H6944]] even for a moment, [[H1104]] or they will die.” [[H4191]] 
21 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
22 “Take a census [[H5375]] of the Gershonites [[H1121]] as well, [[H1571]] by their families [[H1]] and their clans, [[H4940]] 
23 from thirty [[H7970]] to [[H5704]] fifty [[H2572]] years old, [[H1121]] counting [[H6485]] everyone [[H3605]] who comes [[H935]] to serve [[H6633]] in the work [[H5656]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
24 This [[H2063]] is the service [[H5656]] of the Gershonite [[H1649]] clans [[H4940]] regarding work [[H5647]] and transport: [[H4853]] 
25 They are to carry [[H5375]] the curtains [[H3407]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] with the covering [[H4372]] of fine leather [[H8476]] over [[H5921]] it, [[H4605]] the curtains [[H4539]] for the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] 
26 the curtains [[H7050]] of the courtyard, [[H2691]] and [[H853]] the curtains [[H4539]] for the entrance [[H6607]] at the gate [[H8179]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] that [[H834]] surrounds [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and altar, [[H4196]] along with their ropes [[H4340]] and all [[H3605]] the equipment [[H3627]] for their service. [[H5656]] [The Gershonites] will do [[H5647]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] needs to be done [[H6213]] with these items.  
27 All [[H3605]] the service [[H5656]] of the Gershonites— [[H1121]] all [[H3605]] their transport duties [[H4853]] and [[H3605]] other work— [[H5656]] is to be done at [[H5921]] the direction [[H6310]] of Aaron [[H175]] and his sons; [[H1121]] you are to assign [[H6485]] to [[H5921]] them all [[H3605]] that they are responsible [[H4931]] to carry. [[H4853]] 
28 This [[H2063]] is the service [[H5656]] of the Gershonite [[H1121]] clans [[H4940]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and their duties [[H4931]] shall be under the direction [[H3027]] of Ithamar [[H385]] son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
29 As for the sons [[H1121]] of Merari, [[H4847]] you are to register [[H6485]] them by their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] 
30 from thirty [[H7970]] to [[H5704]] fifty [[H2572]] years old, [[H1121]] counting [[H6485]] everyone [[H3605]] who comes [[H935]] to serve [[H6635]] in the work [[H5656]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
31 This [[H2063]] is the duty [[H4931]] for all [[H3605]] their service [[H5656]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting: [[H4150]] to carry [[H4853]] the frames [[H7175]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] with its crossbars, [[H1280]] posts, [[H5982]] and bases, [[H134]] 
32 the posts [[H5982]] of the surrounding [[H5439]] courtyard [[H2691]] with their bases, [[H134]] tent pegs, [[H3489]] and ropes, [[H4340]] including all [[H3605]] their equipment [[H3627]] everything [[H3605]] related to their use. [[H5656]] You shall assign [[H6485]] by name [[H8034]] the items [[H3627]] that they are responsible [[H4931]] to carry. [[H4853]] 
33 This [[H2063]] is the service [[H5656]] of the Merarite [[H1121]] clans [[H4940]] according to all [[H3605]] their work [[H5656]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] under the direction [[H3027]] of Ithamar [[H385]] son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest.” [[H3548]] 
34 So Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and the leaders [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] numbered [[H6485]] the Kohathites [[H1121]] by their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]]

36 And those [[H1961]] numbered [[H6485]] by their clans [[H4940]] totaled 2,750. [[H505]] 
37 These [[H428]] were counted [[H6485]] from the Kohathite [[H6956]] clans, [[H4940]] everyone [[H3605]] who could serve [[H5647]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] numbered [[H6485]] them [[H834]] according to [[H5921]] the command [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
38 Then the Gershonites [[H1121]] were numbered [[H6485]] by their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] 
39 everyone [[H3605]] from thirty [[H7970]] to [[H5704]] fifty [[H2572]] years old [[H1121]] who came [[H935]] to serve [[H6635]] in the work [[H5656]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
40 And those [[H1961]] numbered [[H6485]] by their clans [[H4940]] and families [[H1]] totaled 2,630. [[H505]] 
41 These [[H428]] were counted [[H6485]] from the Gershonite [[H1648]] clans [[H4940]] who served [[H5647]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] whom [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] counted [[H6485]] at [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command. [[H6310]] 
42 And the Merarites [[H4847]] were counted [[H6485]] by their clans [[H4940]] and their families, [[H1]] 
43 everyone [[H3605]] from thirty [[H7970]] to [[H5704]] fifty [[H2572]] years old [[H1121]] who came [[H935]] to serve [[H6635]] in the work [[H5656]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
44 The men registered [[H6485]] by their clans [[H4940]] numbered 3,200. [[H7969]] 
45 These [[H428]] were counted [[H6485]] from the Merarite [[H4847]] clans, [[H4940]] whom [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] numbered [[H6485]] at [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command [[H6310]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
46 So Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and the leaders [[H5387]] of Israel [[H3478]] counted [[H6485]] by their clans [[H4940]] and families [[H1]] all [[H3605]] the Levites [[H3881]]

49 At [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command [[H6310]] they were registered [[H6485]] through [[H3027]] Moses [[H4872]] and each one [[H376]] was assigned [[H6485]] his work [[H5656]] and burden, [[H4853]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]
