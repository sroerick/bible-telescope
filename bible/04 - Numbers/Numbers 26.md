1 After [[H310]] the plague [had ended], [[H4046]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest, [[H3548]] 
2 “Take a census [[H5375]] of the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] and older, [[H4605]] by the houses [[H1004]] of their fathers— [[H1]] all [[H3605]] who can serve [[H3318]] in the army [[H6635]] of Israel.” [[H3478]] 
3 So on the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] by [[H5921]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] across from Jericho, [[H3405]] Moses [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] issued [[H1696]] the instruction, [[H559]] 
4 “[Take a census of the men] twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] and older, [[H4605]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded [[H6680]] Moses.” [[H4872]] And [these were] the Israelites [[H1121]] who came out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] 
5 Reuben [[H7205]] was the firstborn [[H1060]] of Israel. [[H3478]] [These were] the descendants [[H1121]] of Reuben: [[H7205]] The Hanochite [[H2599]] clan [[H4940]] from Hanoch, [[H2585]] the Palluite [[H6384]] clan [[H4940]] from Pallu, [[H6396]] 
6 the Hezronite [[H2697]] clan [[H4940]] from Hezron, [[H2696]] [and] the Carmite [[H3756]] clan [[H4940]] from Carmi. [[H3757]] 
7 These [[H428]] were the [[H1961]] clans [[H4940]] of Reuben, [[H7206]] and their registration [[H6485]] numbered 43,730. [[H7969]] 
8 Now the son [[H1121]] of Pallu [[H6396]] was Eliab, [[H446]] 
9 and the sons [[H1121]] of Eliab [[H446]] were Nemuel, [[H5241]] Dathan, [[H1885]] and Abiram. [[H48]] It [[H1931]] was Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram, [[H48]] chosen [[H7148]] by the congregation, [[H5712]] who [[H834]] fought [[H5327]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] with the followers [[H5712]] of Korah [[H7141]] who rebelled [[H5327]] against [[H5921]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
10 And the earth [[H776]] opened [[H6605]] its mouth [[H6310]] and swallowed [[H1104]] them [[H853]] along with Korah, [[H7141]] whose followers [[H5712]] died [[H4194]] when the fire [[H784]] consumed [[H398]] 250 [[H2572]] men. [[H376]] They serve [[H1961]] as a warning sign. [[H5251]] 
11 However, the line [[H1121]] of Korah [[H7141]] did not [[H3808]] die out. [[H4191]]

17 the Arodite [[H722]] clan [[H4940]] from Arod, [[H720]] [and] the Arelite [[H692]] clan [[H4940]] from Areli. [[H692]] 
18 These [[H428]] [were] the clans [[H4940]] of Gad, [[H1410]] and their registration numbered [[H6485]] 40,500 [[H705]] 
19 The sons [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] [were] Er [[H6147]] and Onan, [[H209]] but they [[H6147]] died [[H4191]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

27 These [were] [[H428]] the clans [[H4940]] of Zebulun, [[H2075]] and their registration numbered [[H6485]] 60,500 [[H8346]] 
28 The descendants [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] [were] their clans [[H4940]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] and Ephraim. [[H669]] 
29 [These were] the descendants [[H1121]] of Manasseh: [[H4519]] The Machirite [[H4354]] clan [[H4940]] from Machir. [[H4353]] Machir [[H4353]] was the father of [[H3205]] Gilead, [[H1568]] the Gileadite [[H1569]] clan [[H4940]] from Gilead. [[H1568]]

33 Now Zelophehad [[H6765]] son [[H1121]] of Hepher [[H2660]] had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] sons— [[H1121]] only [[H3588]] daughters. [[H1323]] The names [[H8034]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Zelophehad [[H6765]] were Mahlah, [[H4244]] Noah, [[H5270]] Hoglah, [[H2295]] Milcah, [[H4435]] and Tirzah. [[H8656]]

39 the Shuphamite [[H7781]] clan [[H4940]] from Shupham, [[H8197]] [and] the Huphamite [[H2350]] clan [[H4940]] from Hupham. [[H2349]]

45 [These were] the descendants [[H1121]] of Beriah: [[H1283]] the Heberite [[H2277]] clan [[H4940]] from Heber, [[H2268]] [and] the Malchielite [[H4440]] clan [[H4940]] from Malchiel. [[H4439]] 
46 And the name [[H8034]] of Asher’s [[H836]] daughter [[H1323]] was Serah. [[H8294]] 
47 These [were] [[H428]] the clans [[H4940]] of Asher, [[H836]] and their registration numbered [[H6485]] 53,400 [[H7969]] 
48 [These were] the descendants [[H1121]] of Naphtali [[H5321]] by their clans: [[H4940]] The Jahzeelite [[H3184]] clan [[H4940]] from Jahzeel, [[H3183]] the Gunite [[H1477]] clan [[H4940]] from Guni, [[H1476]]

50 These [were] [[H428]] the clans [[H4940]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] and their registration numbered [[H6485]] 45,400 [[H2568]] 
51 These [[H428]] men [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] numbered [[H6485]] 601,730 [in all]. [[H8337]] 
52 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
53 “The land [[H776]] is to be divided [[H2505]] among [the tribes] [[H428]] as an inheritance, [[H5159]] according to the number [[H4557]] of names. [[H8034]] 
54 Increase [[H7235]] the inheritance [[H5159]] for a large [tribe] [[H7227]] and decrease [[H4591]] it [[H5159]] for a small one; [[H4592]] each [[H376]] is to receive [[H5414]] its inheritance [[H5159]] according to [[H6310]] the number of those registered. [[H6485]] 
55 Indeed, [[H389]] the land [[H776]] must be divided [[H2505]] by lot; [[H1486]] they shall receive their inheritance [[H5157]] according to the names [[H8034]] of the tribes [[H4294]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
56 Each inheritance [[H5159]] is to be divided [[H2505]] by [[H5921]] lot [[H1486]] among [[H996]] the larger [[H7227]] and smaller tribes.” [[H4592]] 
57 Now these [[H428]] were the Levites [[H3881]] registered [[H6485]] by their clans: [[H4940]] The Gershonite [[H1649]] clan [[H4940]] from Gershon, [[H1648]] the Kohathite [[H6956]] clan [[H4940]] from Kohath, [[H6955]] and the Merarite [[H4848]] clan [[H4940]] from Merari. [[H4847]] 
58 These [were] [[H428]] the families [[H4940]] of the Levites: [[H3881]] The Libnite [[H3846]] clan, [[H4940]] the Hebronite [[H2276]] clan, [[H4940]] the Mahlite [[H4250]] clan, [[H4940]] the Mushite [[H4188]] clan, [[H4940]] and the Korahite [[H7145]] clan. [[H4940]] Now Kohath [[H6955]] was the father of [[H3205]] Amram, [[H6019]] 
59 and Amram’s [[H6019]] wife [[H802]] was named [[H8034]] Jochebed. [[H3115]] She was also a descendant [[H1323]] of Levi, [[H3878]] born [[H3205]] to Levi [[H3878]] in Egypt. [[H4714]] To Amram [[H6019]] she bore [[H3205]] Aaron, [[H175]] Moses, [[H4872]] and their sister [[H269]] Miriam. [[H4813]] 
60 Nadab, [[H5070]] Abihu, [[H30]] Eleazar, [[H499]] and Ithamar [[H385]] were born [[H3205]] to Aaron, [[H175]] 
61 but Nadab [[H5070]] and Abihu [[H30]] died [[H4191]] when they offered [[H7126]] unauthorized [[H2114]] fire [[H784]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
62 The registration [of the Levites] [[H6485]] totaled [[H1961]] 23,000, [[H7969]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] one month old [[H1121]] or more; [[H4605]] they were not [[H3808]] registered [[H6485]] among [[H8432]] the other Israelites, [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] was given [[H5414]] to them among [[H8432]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
63 These [[H428]] were the ones registered [[H6485]] by Moses [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] when [[H834]] they numbered [[H6485]] the Israelites [[H1121]] on the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] by [[H5921]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] across from Jericho. [[H3405]] 
64 Among all these, however, [[H428]] there was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] one [[H376]] who had been registered [[H6485]] by Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] when [[H834]] they numbered [[H6485]] the Israelites [[H1121]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai. [[H5514]] 
65 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had told [[H559]] them  that they would surely die [[H4191]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] Not one [[H3808]] was left [[H3498]] except [[H3588]] Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] and Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun. [[H5126]]
