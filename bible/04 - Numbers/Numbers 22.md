1 Then the Israelites [[H1121]] traveled on [[H5265]] and camped [[H2583]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] near the Jordan, [[H3383]] across from [[H5676]] Jericho. [[H3405]] 
2 Now Balak [[H1111]] son [[H1121]] of Zippor [[H6834]] saw [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Israel [[H3478]] had done [[H6213]] to the Amorites, [[H567]] 
3 and Moab [[H4124]] was terrified [[H1481]] of [[H6440]] the people [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] were numerous. [[H7227]] Indeed, Moab [[H4124]] dreaded [[H6973]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
4 So the Moabites [[H4124]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] of Midian, [[H4080]] “This horde [[H6951]] will devour [[H3897]] everything [[H3605]] around us, [[H5439]] as an ox [[H7794]] licks up [[H3897]] the grass [[H3418]] of the field.” [[H7704]] Since Balak [[H1111]] son [[H1121]] of Zippor [[H6834]] was king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] 
5 he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Balaam [[H1109]] son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] at Pethor, [[H6604]] which [[H834]] is by [[H5921]] the Euphrates [[H5104]] in the land [[H776]] of his people. [[H1121]] “Behold, [[H2009]] a people [[H5971]] has come out [[H3318]] of Egypt,” [[H4714]] said Balak. [[H7121]] “They cover [[H3680]] the face [[H5869]] of the land [[H776]] and have settled [[H3427]] next to me. [[H4136]] 
6 So please [[H4994]] come [[H1980]] now [[H6258]] and put a curse [[H779]] on these [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] are too mighty [[H6099]] for me. [[H4480]] Perhaps I may [[H194]] be able [[H3201]] to defeat [[H5221]] them  and drive them out [[H1644]] of [[H4480]] the land; [[H776]] for [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] that those [[H834]] you bless [[H1288]] are blessed, [[H1288]] and those [[H834]] you curse [[H779]] are cursed. [[H779]] 
7 The elders [[H2205]] of Moab [[H4124]] and Midian [[H4080]] departed [[H1980]] with the fees for divination [[H7081]] in hand. [[H3027]] They came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Balaam [[H1109]] and relayed [[H1696]] to him [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of Balak. [[H1111]] 
8 “Spend [[H3885]] the night [[H3915]] here,” [[H6311]] [Balaam] replied, [[H559]] “and I will give [[H7725]] you the answer [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] speaks [[H1696]] to me.” [[H413]] So the princes [[H8269]] of Moab [[H4124]] stayed [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] Balaam. [[H1109]] 
9 Then God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Balaam [[H1109]] and asked, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] are these [[H428]] men [[H582]] with you?” [[H5973]] 
10 And Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] “Balak [[H1111]] son [[H1121]] of Zippor, [[H6834]] king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] sent me [[H7971]] this message: [[H413]] 
11 ‘Behold, [[H2009]] a people [[H5971]] has come out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and they cover [[H3680]] the face [[H5869]] of the land. [[H776]] Now [[H6258]] come [[H1980]] and put a curse [[H6895]] on them [[H853]] for me.  Perhaps I may [[H194]] be able [[H3201]] to fight [[H3898]] against them  and drive them away.’” [[H1644]] 
12 But God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] “Do not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] with them. [[H5973]] You are not [[H3808]] to curse [[H779]] this people, [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] are blessed.” [[H1288]] 
13 So Balaam [[H1109]] got up [[H6965]] the next morning [[H1242]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Balak’s [[H1111]] princes, [[H8269]] “Go back [[H1980]] to [[H413]] your homeland, [[H776]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has refused [[H3985]] to let [[H5414]] me go [[H1980]] with you.” [[H5973]] 
14 And the princes [[H8269]] of Moab [[H4124]] arose, [[H6965]] returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] and said, [[H559]] “Balaam [[H1109]] refused [[H3985]] to come [[H1980]] with us.” [[H5973]] 
15 Then Balak [[H1111]] sent [[H7971]] other [[H3254]] princes, [[H8269]] more numerous [[H7227]] and more distinguished [[H3513]] than the [first messengers]. [[H428]] 
16 They came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Balaam [[H1109]] and said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] Balak [[H1111]] son [[H1121]] of Zippor [[H6834]] says: [[H559]] ‘Please [[H4994]] let nothing [[H408]] hinder [[H4513]] you from coming [[H1980]] to me, [[H413]] 
17 for [[H3588]] I will honor you [[H3513]] richly [[H3966]] and do [[H6213]] whatever [[H3605]] you say. [[H559]] So please [[H4994]] come [[H1980]] and put a curse [[H6895]] on these [[H2088]] people for me!’” [[H5971]] 
18 But Balaam [[H1109]] replied [[H6030]] to [[H413]] the servants [[H5650]] of Balak, [[H1111]] “If [[H518]] Balak [[H1111]] were to give [[H5414]] me his house [[H1004]] full [[H4393]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] I could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] anything small [[H6996]] or [[H176]] great [[H1419]] to go beyond [[H5674]] the command [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] my God. [[H430]] 
19 So now, [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] stay [[H3427]] here [[H2088]] overnight [[H3915]] as the others did, [[H1571]] that I may find out [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] else [[H3254]] the LORD [[H3068]] has to tell me.” [[H1696]] 
20 That night [[H3915]] God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Balaam [[H1109]] and said, [[H559]] “Since [[H518]] these men [[H376]] have come [[H935]] to summon you, [[H7121]] get up [[H6965]] and go [[H1980]] with them, [[H854]] but you must only [[H389]] do [[H6213]] what [[H834]] I tell you.” [[H1696]] 
21 So Balaam [[H1109]] got up [[H6965]] in the morning, [[H1242]] saddled [[H2280]] his donkey, [[H860]] and went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] the princes [[H8269]] of Moab. [[H4124]] 
22 Then God’s [[H430]] anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] because [[H3588]] Balaam [[H1931]] was going along, [[H1980]] and the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] stood [[H3320]] in the road [[H1870]] to oppose him. [[H7854]] Balaam [[H1931]] was riding [[H7392]] his donkey, [[H860]] and his two [[H8147]] servants [[H5288]] were with him. [[H5973]] 
23 When the donkey [[H860]] saw [[H7200]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] standing [[H5324]] in the road [[H1870]] with a drawn [[H8025]] sword [[H2719]] in His hand, [[H3027]] she [[H860]] turned [[H5186]] off [[H4480]] the path [[H1870]] and went [[H1980]] into a field. [[H7704]] So Balaam [[H1109]] beat [[H5221]] her [[H860]] to return her [[H5186]] to the path. [[H1870]] 
24 Then the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] stood [[H5975]] in a narrow passage [[H4934]] between two vineyards, [[H3754]] with walls [[H1447]] on either side. [[H2088]] 
25 And the donkey [[H860]] saw [[H7200]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and pressed [[H3905]] herself against [[H413]] the wall, [[H7023]] crushing [[H3905]] Balaam’s [[H1109]] foot [[H7272]] against [[H413]] it. [[H7023]] So he beat her [[H5221]] once again. [[H3254]] 
26 And the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] moved [[H5674]] on ahead [[H3254]] and stood [[H5975]] in a narrow [[H6862]] place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] there was no [[H369]] room [[H1870]] to turn [[H5186]] to the right [[H3225]] or left. [[H8040]] 
27 When the donkey [[H860]] saw [[H7200]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] she lay down [[H7257]] under [[H8478]] Balaam, [[H1109]] and [he] [[H1109]] became furious [[H2734]] and beat [[H5221]] [her] [[H860]] with his staff. [[H4731]] 
28 Then the LORD [[H3068]] opened [[H6605]] the donkey’s [[H860]] mouth, [[H6310]] and she said [[H559]] to Balaam, [[H1109]] “What [[H4100]] have I done [[H6213]] to you  that [[H3588]] you have beaten [[H5221]] me these [[H2088]] three [[H7969]] times?” [[H7272]] 
29 Balaam [[H1109]] answered [[H559]] the donkey, [[H860]] “You have made a fool of me! [[H5953]] If [[H3863]] I had [[H3426]] a sword [[H2719]] in my hand, [[H3027]] I would kill you [[H2026]] right now!” [[H6258]] 
30 But the donkey [[H860]] said [[H559]] to Balaam, [[H1109]] “Am I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] the donkey [[H860]] you have ridden [[H7392]] all your life [[H5750]] until today? [[H5704]] Have I ever treated [[H6213]] you  this way [[H3541]] before?” [[H5532]] “No,” [[H3808]] he replied. [[H559]] 
31 Then the LORD [[H3068]] opened [[H1540]] Balaam’s [[H1109]] eyes, [[H5869]] and he saw [[H7200]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] standing [[H5324]] in the road [[H1870]] with a drawn [[H8025]] sword [[H2719]] in His hand. [[H3027]] And Balaam bowed low [[H7812]] and fell facedown. [[H639]] 
32 The Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] asked him, [[H559]] “Why [[H5921]] have you beaten [[H5221]] your donkey [[H860]] these [[H2088]] three [[H7969]] times? [[H7272]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] have come out [[H3318]] to oppose you, [[H7854]] because [[H3588]] your way [[H1870]] is perverse [[H3399]] before me. [[H5048]] 
33 The donkey [[H860]] saw [[H7200]] me and turned away [[H5186]] from me [[H6440]] these [[H2088]] three [[H7969]] times. [[H7272]] If she had not [[H194]] turned away, [[H5186]] I would surely have killed [[H2026]] you [[H853]] by now, [[H6258]] and let her live.” [[H2421]] 
34 “I have sinned,” [[H2398]] Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] “for [[H3588]] I did not [[H3808]] realize [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] were standing [[H5324]] in the road [[H1870]] to confront me. [[H7125]] And now, [[H6258]] if [[H518]] this is displeasing [[H7451]] in Your sight, [[H5869]] I will go back [home].” [[H7725]] 
35 But the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] “Go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] the men, [[H376]] but you are to speak [[H1696]] only [[H657]] what [[H834]] I tell you.” [[H1696]] So Balaam [[H1109]] went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] the princes [[H8269]] of Balak. [[H1111]] 
36 When Balak [[H1111]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Balaam [[H1109]] was coming, [[H935]] he went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] him at [[H413]] the Moabite [[H4124]] city [[H5892]] on [[H5921]] the Arnon [[H769]] border, [[H1366]] at the edge [[H7097]] of his territory. [[H1366]] 
37 And [he] [[H1111]] said to [[H559]] Balaam, [[H1109]] “Did I not [[H3808]] send you an urgent summons? [[H7971]] Why [[H4100]] did you not come [[H1980]] to me? [[H413]] Am I really [[H552]] not [[H3808]] able [[H3201]] to richly reward you?” [[H3513]] 
38 “See, [[H2009]] I have come [[H935]] to you,” [[H413]] Balaam [[H1109]] replied, [[H559]] “but can [[H3201]] I say [[H1696]] just anything? [[H3972]] I must speak [[H1696]] only the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] puts [[H7760]] in my mouth.” [[H6310]] 
39 So Balaam [[H1109]] accompanied [[H1980]] Balak, [[H1111]] and they came [[H935]] to Kiriath-huzoth. [[H7155]] 
40 Balak [[H1111]] sacrificed [[H2076]] cattle [[H1241]] and sheep, [[H6629]] and he gave [portions] [[H7971]] to Balaam [[H1109]] and the princes [[H8269]] who [[H834]] were with him. [[H854]] 
41 The next morning, [[H1242]] Balak [[H1111]] took [[H3947]] Balaam [[H1109]] and brought him [[H5927]] up to Bamoth-baal. [[H1120]] From there [[H8033]] he could see [[H7200]] the outskirts of the camp [[H7097]] of the people. [[H5971]]
