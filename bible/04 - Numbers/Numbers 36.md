# Numbers 36
[[Numbers 35|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 1|→]]
1 Now the family [[H1]] heads [[H7218]] of the clan [[H4940]] of Gilead [[H1568]] son [[H1121]] of Machir [[H4353]] son [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] one of the clans [[H4940]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] approached [[H7126]] and addressed [[H1696]] Moses [[H4872]] and the leaders [[H5387]] who were the heads [[H7218]] of the Israelite [[H1121]] families, [[H3478]] 
2 saying, [[H559]] “When the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] my lord [[H113]] to give [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] to the Israelites [[H1121]] by lot, [[H1486]] [He] [[H3068]] also commanded [[H6680]] [him] [[H113]] to give [[H5414]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of our brother [[H251]] Zelophehad [[H6765]] to his daughters. [[H1323]] 
3 But if they marry [[H1961]] any of the men [[H259]] from the [other] tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] their inheritance [[H5159]] will be withdrawn [[H1639]] from the portion [[H5159]] of our fathers [[H1]] and added [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] the tribe [[H4294]] into which [[H834]] they marry. [[H1961]] So our  allotted [[H1486]] inheritance [[H5159]] would be taken away. [[H1639]] 
4 And when [[H518]] the Jubilee [[H3104]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] comes, [[H1961]] their inheritance [[H5159]] will be added [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] the tribe [[H4294]] into which [[H834]] they marry [[H1961]] [and] [[H5159]] taken away [[H1639]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of our fathers.” [[H1]] 
5 So at [[H5921]] the word [[H6310]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] the Israelites: [[H1121]] “The tribe [[H4294]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] speaks [[H1696]] correctly. [[H3651]] 
6 This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded [[H6680]] concerning the daughters [[H1323]] of Zelophehad: [[H6765]] They may marry [[H1961]] anyone they please, [[H2896]] provided [[H389]] they marry [[H1961]] within a clan [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of their father. [[H1]] 
7 No [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] in Israel [[H1121]] may be transferred [[H5437]] from tribe [[H4294]] to [[H413]] tribe, [[H4294]] because [[H3588]] each [[H376]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] is to retain [[H1692]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of his fathers. [[H1]] 
8 Every [[H3605]] daughter [[H1323]] who possesses [[H3423]] an inheritance [[H5159]] from any Israelite [[H3478]] tribe [[H4294]] must marry [[H1961]] within a clan [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of her father, [[H1]] so that [[H4616]] every [[H376]] Israelite [[H1121]] will possess [[H3423]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of his fathers. [[H1]] 
9 No [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] may be transferred [[H5437]] from one tribe [[H4294]] to another, [[H4294]] because [[H3588]] each [[H376]] tribe [[H4294]] of Israel [[H3478]] must retain [[H1692]] its inheritance.” [[H5159]] 
10 So the daughters [[H1323]] of Zelophehad [[H6765]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
11 Mahlah, [[H4244]] Tirzah, [[H8656]] Hoglah, [[H2295]] Milcah, [[H4435]] and Noah, [[H5270]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Zelophehad, [[H6765]] were married [[H802]] to cousins on their [[H1121]] father’s side. [[H1730]] 
12 They married [[H1961]] within the clans [[H4940]] of the descendants [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] son [[H1121]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] and their inheritance [[H5159]] remained [[H1961]] within [[H5921]] the tribe [[H4294]] of their father’s [[H1]] clan. [[H4940]] 
13 These [[H428]] are the commandments [[H4687]] and ordinances [[H4941]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H6680]] to the Israelites [[H1121]] through [[H3027]] Moses [[H4872]] on the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] by [[H5921]] the Jordan [[H3383]] across from Jericho. [[H3405]]
