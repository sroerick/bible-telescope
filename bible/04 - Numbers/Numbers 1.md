1 On the first [[H259]] day of the second [[H8145]] month [[H2320]] of the second [[H8145]] year [[H8141]] after [the Israelites] had come out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai. [[H5514]] He told him, [[H559]] 
2 “Take a census [[H5375]] of the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] by their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] listing [[H4557]] the name [[H8034]] of every [[H3605]] man, [[H2145]] one by one. [[H1538]] 
3 You [[H859]] and Aaron [[H175]] are to register [[H6485]] those [[H853]] who are twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] by their divisions— [[H6635]] everyone [[H3605]] who can serve [[H3318]] in Israel’s [[H3478]] army. [[H6635]] 
4 And one man [[H376]] from each tribe, [[H4294]] the head [[H7218]] of each family, [[H1]] must be there [[H1961]] with you. [[H854]] 
5 These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of the men [[H376]] who [[H834]] are to assist [[H5975]] you: [[H854]] From [the tribe of] Reuben, [[H7205]] Elizur [[H468]] son [[H1121]] of Shedeur; [[H7707]] 
6 from Simeon, [[H8095]] Shelumiel [[H8017]] son [[H1121]] of Zurishaddai; [[H6701]] 
7 from Judah, [[H3063]] Nahshon [[H5177]] son [[H1121]] of Amminadab; [[H5992]] 
8 from Issachar, [[H3485]] Nethanel [[H5417]] son [[H1121]] of Zuar; [[H6686]] 
9 from Zebulun, [[H2074]] Eliab [[H446]] son [[H1121]] of Helon; [[H2497]] 
10 from the sons [[H1121]] of Joseph: [[H3130]] from Ephraim, [[H669]] Elishama [[H476]] son [[H1121]] of Ammihud, [[H5989]] and from Manasseh, [[H4519]] Gamaliel [[H1583]] son [[H1121]] of Pedahzur; [[H6301]] 
11 from Benjamin, [[H1144]] Abidan [[H27]] son [[H1121]] of Gideoni; [[H1441]] 
12 from Dan, [[H1835]] Ahiezer [[H295]] son [[H1121]] of Ammishaddai; [[H5996]] 
13 from Asher, [[H836]] Pagiel [[H6295]] son [[H1121]] of Ocran; [[H5918]] 
14 from Gad, [[H1410]] Eliasaph [[H460]] son [[H1121]] of Deuel; [[H1845]] 
15 [and] from Naphtali, [[H5321]] Ahira [[H299]] son [[H1121]] of Enan.” [[H5881]] 
16 These men [[H428]] were appointed [[H7148]] from the congregation; [[H5712]] they [were] [[H1992]] the leaders [[H5387]] of the tribes [[H4294]] of their fathers, [[H1]] the heads [[H7218]] of the clans [[H505]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
17 So Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] took [[H3947]] these men [[H428]] who [[H834]] had been designated [[H5344]] by name, [[H8034]] 
18 and [[H853]] on the first [[H259]] day of the second [[H8145]] month [[H2320]] they assembled [[H6950]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] and recorded their ancestry [[H3205]] by [[H5921]] clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] one by one [[H1538]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older, [[H4605]] 
19 just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] So [Moses] numbered [[H6485]] them in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai: [[H5514]] 
20 From the sons [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Israel, [[H3478]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] one [[H1538]] by one the names [[H8034]] of every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older, [[H4605]] everyone [[H3605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
21 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Reuben [[H7205]] numbered 46,500. [[H8337]] 
22 From the sons [[H1121]] of Simeon, [[H8095]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] one [[H1538]] by one the names [[H8034]] of every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
23 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Simeon [[H8095]] numbered 59,300. [[H8672]] 
24 From the sons [[H1121]] of Gad, [[H1410]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
25 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Gad [[H1410]] numbered 45,650. [[H2568]] 
26 From the sons [[H1121]] of Judah, [[H3063]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
27 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah [[H3063]] numbered 74,600. [[H702]] 
28 From the sons [[H1121]] of Issachar, [[H3485]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
29 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Issachar [[H3485]] numbered 54,400. [[H702]] 
30 From the sons [[H1121]] of Zebulun, [[H2074]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
31 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Zebulun [[H2074]] numbered 57,400. [[H7651]] 
32 From the sons [[H1121]] of Joseph: [[H3130]] From the sons [[H1121]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
33 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Ephraim [[H669]] numbered 40,500. [[H705]] 
34 And from the sons [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
35 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] numbered 32,200. [[H8147]] 
36 From the sons [[H1121]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
37 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] numbered 35,400. [[H2568]] 
38 From the sons [[H1121]] of Dan, [[H1835]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
39 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan [[H1835]] numbered 62,700. [[H8147]] 
40 From the sons [[H1121]] of Asher, [[H836]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
41 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Asher [[H836]] numbered 41,500. [[H259]] 
42 From the sons [[H1121]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] according to the records [[H8435]] of their clans [[H4940]] and families, [[H1]] counting [[H4557]] the names [[H8034]] of those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] 
43 those registered [[H6485]] to the tribe [[H4294]] of Naphtali [[H5321]] numbered 53,400. [[H7969]] 
44 These [[H428]] were the men [[H834]] numbered [[H6485]] by Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] with the assistance of the twelve [[H8147]] leaders [[H5387]] of Israel; [[H3478]] each one [[H259]] representing his family. [[H1]] 
45 So all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who could serve [[H3318]] in Israel’s [[H3478]] army [[H6635]] were [[H1961]] registered [[H6485]] according to their families. [[H1]] 
46 And [[H1961]] the total of [[H3605]] those registered [[H6485]] numbered 603,550. [[H8337]] 
47 The Levites, however, [[H3881]] were not [[H3808]] registered [[H6485]] with [[H8432]] the tribe [[H4294]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
48 For the LORD [[H3068]] had said to [[H1696]] Moses: [[H4872]] 
49 “Do not [[H3808]] register [[H6485]] the tribe [[H4294]] of Levi [[H3881]] in the census [[H7218]] with [[H8432]] the other Israelites. [[H1121]] 
50 Instead, [[H859]] you are to appoint [[H6485]] the Levites [[H3881]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the testimony, [[H5715]] all [[H3605]] its furnishings, [[H3627]] and everything in it. [[H3605]] They [[H1992]] shall carry [[H5375]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and all [[H3605]] its articles, [[H3627]] care for it, [[H8334]] and camp [[H2583]] around [[H5439]] it. [[H4908]] 
51 Whenever the tabernacle [[H4908]] is to move, [[H5265]] the Levites [[H3881]] are to take it down, [[H3381]] and whenever it [[H4908]] is to be pitched, [[H2583]] the Levites [[H3881]] are to set it up. [[H6965]] Any outsider [[H2114]] who goes near it [[H7126]] must be put to death. [[H4191]] 
52 The Israelites [[H1121]] are to camp [[H2583]] by their divisions, [[H6635]] each man [[H376]] in [[H5921]] his own camp [[H4264]] and under [[H5921]] his own [family] banner. [[H1714]] 
53 But the Levites [[H3881]] are to camp [[H2583]] around [[H5439]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] and watch over it, [[H8104]] so that no [[H3808]] wrath [[H7110]] shall fall [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the Israelite [[H1121]] congregation. [[H5712]] So the Levites [[H3881]] are responsible [[H4931]] for the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Testimony.” [[H5715]] 
54 Thus the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]
