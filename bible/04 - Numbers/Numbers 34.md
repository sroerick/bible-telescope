1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Command [[H6680]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and say [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] When [[H3588]] you [[H859]] enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] it [[H776]] will be allotted [[H5307]] to you as an inheritance [[H5159]] with these boundaries: [[H1367]] 
3 Your southern [[H5045]] border [[H6285]] will extend [[H1961]] from the wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin [[H6790]] along [[H5921]] the border [[H3027]] of Edom. [[H123]] On the east, [[H6924]] your southern [[H5045]] border [[H1366]] will extend [[H1961]] from the end [[H7097]] of the Salt [[H4417]] Sea, [[H3220]] 
4 turn [[H5437]] from the south [[H5045]] to the ascent of Akrabbim, [[H4610]] continue [[H5674]] to Zin, [[H6790]] and go [[H1961]] south [[H5045]] of Kadesh-barnea. [[H6947]] Then it will go on [[H3318]] to Hazar-addar [[H2692]] and proceed [[H5674]] to Azmon, [[H6111]] 
5 where [it] [[H1366]] will turn [[H5437]] from Azmon, [[H6111]] join the Brook [[H5158]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and end [[H1961]] at the Sea. [[H3220]] 
6 Your western [[H3220]] border [[H1366]] will be [[H1961]] the coastline [[H1366]] of the Great [[H1419]] Sea; [[H3220]] this [[H2088]] will be [[H1961]] your  boundary [[H1366]] on the west. [[H3220]] 
7 Your northern [[H6828]] border [[H1366]] will run [[H1961]] from [[H4480]] the Great [[H1419]] Sea [[H3220]] directly [[H8376]] to Mount [[H2022]] Hor, [[H2023]] 
8 and from Mount [[H2022]] Hor [[H2023]] to Lebo-hamath, [[H2574]] [then] [[H1366]] extending [[H1961]] to Zedad, [[H6657]] 
9 continuing [[H3318]] to Ziphron, [[H2202]] and ending [[H1961]] at Hazar-enan. [[H2704]] This [[H2088]] will be [[H1961]] your  boundary [[H1366]] on the north. [[H6828]] 
10 And your eastern [[H6924]] border [[H1366]] will run straight [[H184]] from  Hazar-enan [[H2704]] to Shepham, [[H8221]] 
11 [then] [[H1366]] go down [[H3381]] from Shepham [[H8221]] to Riblah [[H7247]] on the east side [[H6924]] of Ain [[H5871]] and continue along [[H3381]] the slopes [[H3802]] east [[H6924]] of the Sea [[H3220]] of Chinnereth. [[H3672]] 
12 Then the border [[H1366]] will go down [[H3381]] along the Jordan [[H3383]] and end [[H1961]] at the Salt [[H4417]] Sea. [[H3220]] This [[H2063]] will be [[H1961]] your land, [[H776]] defined by its borders [[H1367]] on all sides.” [[H5439]] 
13 So Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “{Apportion} this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] by lot [[H1486]] as an inheritance, [[H5157]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] to be given [[H5414]] to the nine [[H8672]] and a half [[H2677]] tribes. [[H4294]] 
14 For [[H3588]] the tribes [[H4294]] of the Reubenites [[H1121]] [and] [[H4294]] Gadites, [[H1121]] along with the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] have already received their inheritance. [[H3947]] 
15 These two [[H8147]] and a half [[H2677]] tribes [[H4294]] have received [[H3947]] their inheritance [[H5159]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] from Jericho, [[H3405]] toward the sunrise.” [[H4217]] 
16 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
17 “These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of the men [[H376]] who [[H834]] are to assign the land [[H776]] as an inheritance for you: [[H5157]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] and Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun. [[H5126]] 
18 Appoint [[H3947]] one [[H259]] leader [[H5387]] from each [[H259]] tribe [[H4294]] to distribute [[H5157]] the land. [[H776]] 
19 These [[H428]] are their names: [[H8034]] Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah; [[H3063]] 
20 Shemuel [[H8050]] son [[H1121]] of Ammihud [[H5989]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Simeon; [[H1121]] 
21 Elidad [[H449]] son [[H1121]] of Chislon [[H3692]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Benjamin; [[H1144]] 
22 Bukki [[H1231]] son [[H1121]] of Jogli, [[H3020]] a leader [[H5387]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan; [[H1121]] 
23 Hanniel [[H2592]] son [[H1121]] of Ephod, [[H641]] a leader [[H5387]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Manasseh [[H1121]] son [[H1121]] of Joseph; [[H3130]] 
24 Kemuel [[H7055]] son [[H1121]] of Shiphtan, [[H8204]] a leader [[H5387]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Ephraim [son of Joseph]; [[H1121]] 
25 Eli-zaphan [[H469]] son [[H1121]] of Parnach, [[H6535]] a leader [[H5387]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Zebulun; [[H1121]] 
26 Paltiel [[H6409]] son [[H1121]] of Azzan, [[H5821]] a leader [[H5387]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Issachar; [[H1121]] 
27 Ahihud [[H282]] son [[H1121]] of Shelomi, [[H8015]] a leader [[H5387]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Asher; [[H1121]] 
28 and Pedahel [[H6300]] son [[H1121]] of Ammihud, [[H5989]] a leader [[H5387]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Naphtali.” [[H1121]] 
29 These [[H428]] are the ones whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] to apportion the inheritance [[H5157]] to the Israelites [[H1121]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]
