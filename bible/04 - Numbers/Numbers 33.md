38 At [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command, [[H6310]] Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] climbed [[H5927]] Mount [[H2022]] Hor [[H2023]] and died [[H4191]] there [[H8033]] on the first [[H259]] [day] of the fifth [[H2549]] month, [[H2320]] in the fortieth [[H705]] year [[H8141]] after the Israelites [[H1121]] came out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

50 On the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] by [[H5921]] the Jordan [[H3383]] across from Jericho, [[H3405]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
51 “Speak to [[H1696]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell [[H559]] them: [[H413]] When [[H3588]] you [[H859]] cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] 
52 you must drive out [[H3423]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] before you, [[H6440]] destroy [[H6]] all [[H3605]] their carved images [[H4906]] and cast [[H4541]] idols, [[H6754]] and demolish [[H8045]] all [[H3605]] their high places. [[H1116]] 
53 You are to take possession of [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] and settle [[H3427]] in it,  for [[H3588]] I have given [[H5414]] you the land [[H776]] to possess. [[H3423]] 
54 And you are to divide [[H5157]] the land [[H776]] by lot [[H1486]] according to your clans. [[H4940]] Give a larger [[H7235]] inheritance [[H5159]] to a larger clan [[H7227]] and a smaller [[H4591]] inheritance [[H5159]] to a smaller one. [[H4592]] Whatever [[H834]] falls [[H3318]] to each one  by lot [[H1486]] will be his. [[H1961]] You will receive an inheritance [[H5157]] according to the tribes [[H4294]] of your fathers. [[H1]] 
55 But if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] before you, [[H6440]] those [[H834]] you allow to remain [[H3498]] will become [[H1961]] thorns [[H7899]] in your eyes [[H5869]] and in your sides; [[H6654]] they will harass [[H6887]] you in [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] settle. [[H3427]] 
56 And then [[H1961]] I will do to you [[H6213]] what [[H834]] I had planned [[H1819]] to do to them.” [[H6213]]
