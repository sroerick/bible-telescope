[[Numbers 24|←]] • [[Numbers 26|→]]
1 While Israel [[H3478]] was staying [[H3427]] in Acacia Grove, [[H7851]] the men [[H5971]] began [[H2490]] to indulge in sexual immorality [[H2181]] with [[H413]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Moab, [[H4124]] 
2 who also invited [[H7121]] them [[H5971]] to the sacrifices [[H2077]] for their gods. [[H430]] And the people [[H5971]] ate [[H398]] and bowed down [[H7812]] to these gods. [[H430]] 
3 So Israel [[H3478]] joined in worshiping [[H6775]] Baal of Peor, [[H1187]] and the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against [them]. [[H3478]] 
4 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Take [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H7218]] of the people [[H5971]] and execute [[H3363]] them in [[H5048]] broad daylight [[H8121]] before the LORD, [[H3068]] so that His [[H3068]] fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] may turn away [[H7725]] from Israel.” [[H3478]] 
5 So Moses [[H4872]] told [[H559]] the judges [[H8199]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “Each of you must kill [[H2026]] all of his men [[H582]] who have joined in worshiping [[H6775]] Baal of Peor.” [[H1187]] 
6 Just then, [[H2009]] an Israelite [[H1121]] man [[H376]] brought [[H7126]] to his family [[H251]] a Midianite woman [[H4084]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Moses [[H4872]] [and] [[H5869]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] while they [[H1992]] were weeping [[H1058]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
7 On seeing this, [[H7200]] Phinehas [[H6372]] son [[H1121]] of Eleazar, [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest, [[H3548]] got up [[H6965]] from [[H8432]] the assembly, [[H5712]] took [[H3947]] a spear [[H7420]] in his hand, [[H3027]] 
8 followed [[H935]] the Israelite [[H3478]] into [[H413]] his tent, [[H6898]] and drove [the spear] through [[H1856]] both of them— [[H8147]] through the Israelite [[H3478]] and on through [[H413]] the belly [[H6897]] of the woman. [[H802]] So the plague [[H4046]] against [[H5921]] the Israelites [[H1121]] was halted, [[H6113]] 
9 but those who died [[H4191]] in the plague [[H4046]] numbered 24,000. [[H702]] 
10 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
11 “Phinehas [[H6372]] son [[H1121]] of Eleazar, [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest, [[H3548]] has turned [[H7725]] My wrath [[H2534]] away from [[H5921]] the Israelites; [[H1121]] for he was zealous [[H7068]] [for My sake] [[H7068]] among them, [[H8432]] so that I did not [[H3808]] consume [[H3615]] the Israelites [[H1121]] in My zeal. [[H7068]] 
12 Declare, [[H559]] therefore, [[H3651]] that [[H2005]] I grant [[H5414]] him  My covenant [[H1285]] of peace. [[H7965]] 
13 It will be [[H1961]] a covenant [[H1285]] of permanent [[H5769]] priesthood [[H3550]] for him  and his descendants, [[H2233]] because [[H8478]] he was zealous [[H7065]] for his God [[H430]] and made atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the Israelites.” [[H1121]] 
14 The name [[H8034]] of the Israelite [[H3478]] who was slain [[H5221]] with [[H854]] the Midianie woman [[H4084]] was Zimri [[H2174]] son [[H1121]] of Salu, [[H5543]] the leader [[H5387]] of a Simeonite [[H8099]] family. [[H1]] 
15 And the name [[H8034]] of the slain [[H5221]] Midianite [[H4084]] woman [[H802]] was Cozbi, [[H3579]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Zur, [[H6698]] a tribal [[H523]] chief [[H7218]] of a Midianite [[H4080]] family. [[H1]] 
16 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to Moses, [[H4872]] 
17 “Attack [[H6887]] the Midianites [[H4084]] and strike them dead. [[H5221]] 
18 For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] assailed you [[H6887]] deceitfully [[H5231]] when [[H834]] they seduced [[H5230]] you  in [[H5921]] the matter [[H1697]] of Peor [[H6465]] and [[H5921]] their sister [[H269]] Cozbi, [[H3579]] the daughter [[H1323]] of the Midianite [[H4080]] leader, [[H5387]] [the woman] who was killed [[H5221]] on the day [[H3117]] the plague [[H4046]] came [[H5921]] because of [[H1697]] Peor.
