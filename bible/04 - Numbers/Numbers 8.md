1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] and tell him: [[H559]] When you set up [[H5927]] the seven [[H7651]] lamps, [[H5216]] they are to light [the area] [[H215]] in [[H413]] front [[H4136]] of the lampstand.” [[H4501]] 
3 And Aaron [[H175]] did [[H6213]] so; [[H3651]] he set up [[H5927]] the lamps [[H5216]] facing [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] the front [[H4136]] of the lampstand, [[H4501]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
4 This is how [[H2088]] the lampstand [[H4501]] was constructed: [[H4639]] it was made of hammered [[H4749]] gold [[H2091]] from [[H5704]] its base [[H3409]] to [[H5704]] its blossoms, [[H6525]] fashioned [[H6213]] according to the pattern [[H4758]] the LORD [[H3068]] had shown [[H7200]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
5 Again the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]] 
6 “Take [[H3947]] the Levites [[H3881]] from among [[H8432]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and make them ceremonially clean. [[H2891]] 
7 This is what [[H3541]] you must do [[H6213]] to cleanse them: [[H2891]] Sprinkle [[H5137]] them [[H5921]] with the water [[H4325]] of purification. [[H2403]] Have them shave [[H5674]] their whole [[H3605]] bodies [[H1320]] and wash [[H3526]] their clothes, [[H899]] and so purify themselves. [[H2891]] 
8 Then have them take [[H3947]] a young bull [[H6499]] with its grain offering [[H4503]] of fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with oil, [[H8081]] and you are to take [[H3947]] a second [[H8145]] young bull [[H6499]] for a sin offering. [[H2403]] 
9 Bring [[H7126]] the Levites [[H3881]] before [[H6440]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and assemble [[H6950]] the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
10 You are to present [[H7126]] the Levites [[H3881]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3069]] and have the Israelites [[H1121]] lay [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] [them]. [[H3881]] 
11 Aaron [[H175]] is to present [[H5130]] the Levites [[H3881]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] from the sons [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] so that they may perform [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 And the Levites [[H3881]] are to lay [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the heads [[H7218]] of the bulls, [[H6499]] and offer [[H6213]] to the LORD [[H3068]] one [[H259]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] and the other [[H259]] as a burnt offering, [[H5930]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the Levites. [[H3881]] 
13 You are to have the Levites [[H3881]] stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] and then present [[H5130]] them before the LORD [[H3068]] as a wave offering. [[H8573]] 
14 In this way you shall separate [[H914]] the Levites [[H3881]] from [[H8432]] the rest of the Israelites, [[H1121]] and the Levites [[H3881]] will belong [[H1961]] to Me.  
15 After [[H310]] you have cleansed [[H2891]] them [[H853]] and presented [[H5130]] them as a wave offering, [[H8573]] [they] [[H3881]] may come [[H935]] to serve [[H5647]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
16 For [[H3588]] [the Levites] [[H1992]] have been wholly given [[H5414]] to Me  from among [[H8432]] the sons [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]] I have taken [[H3947]] them for Myself [[H853]] in place of [[H8478]] all [[H3605]] who come first [[H6363]] from the womb, [[H7358]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
17 For [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H1060]] among the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] is Mine,  both man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]] I set them apart [[H6942]] for Myself  on the day [[H3117]] I struck down [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
18 But I have taken [[H3947]] the Levites [[H3881]] in place of [[H8478]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] among the sons [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
19 And I have given [[H5414]] the Levites [[H3881]] as a gift [[H5414]] to Aaron [[H175]] [and] his sons [[H1121]] from among [[H8432]] the Israelites, [[H3478]] to perform [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and to make atonement [[H3722]] on their [[H1121]] behalf, [[H5921]] so that no [[H3808]] plague [[H5063]] will come [[H1961]] against the Israelites [[H1121]] when they [[H1121]] approach [[H5066]] the sanctuary. [[H6944]] 
20 Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] to the Levites [[H3881]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] [they] [[H1121]] should do. [[H6213]] 
21 The Levites [[H3881]] purified [[H2398]] themselves and washed [[H3526]] their clothes, [[H899]] and Aaron [[H175]] presented [[H5130]] them [[H853]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Aaron [[H175]] also made atonement [[H3722]] for them [[H5921]] to cleanse them. [[H2891]] 
22 After [[H310]] that, [[H3651]] the Levites [[H3881]] came [[H935]] to perform [[H5647]] their service [[H5656]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] in the presence [[H6440]] of Aaron [[H175]] and his sons. [[H1121]] So [[H3651]] they did [[H6213]] to the Levites [[H3881]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
23 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
24 “This [[H2063]] applies [[H834]] to the Levites: [[H3881]] Men twenty-five [[H2568]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] shall enter [[H935]] to perform [[H6633]] the service [[H6635]] in the work [[H5656]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
25 But at the age [[H1121]] of fifty, [[H2572]] they must retire [[H7725]] from performing [[H6635]] the work [[H5656]] and no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] serve. [[H5647]] 
26 After that, they may assist [[H8334]] their brothers [[H251]] in fulfilling [[H8104]] their duties [[H4931]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] but they themselves are not [[H3808]] to do [[H5647]] the work. [[H5656]] This is how [[H3602]] you are to assign [[H6213]] responsibilities [[H4931]] to the Levites.” [[H3881]]
