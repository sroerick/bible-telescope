1 Then the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] lifted [[H5375]] up their voices [[H6963]] and cried out, [[H5414]] and that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] the people [[H5971]] wept. [[H1058]] 
2 All [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] grumbled [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] and the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “If only [[H3863]] we had died [[H4191]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] or [[H176]] if only [[H3863]] we had died [[H4191]] in this [[H2088]] wilderness! [[H4057]] 
3 Why [[H4100]] is the LORD [[H3068]] bringing [[H935]] us into [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to fall [[H5307]] by the sword? [[H2719]] Our wives [[H802]] and children [[H2945]] will become [[H1961]] plunder. [[H957]] Would it not [[H3808]] be better [[H2896]] for us to go back [[H7725]] to Egypt?” [[H4714]] 
4 So they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another, [[H251]] “Let us appoint [[H5414]] a leader [[H7218]] and return [[H7725]] to Egypt.” [[H4714]] 
5 Then Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H6440]] before [[H6440]] the entire [[H3605]] assembled [[H6951]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
6 Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] and Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh, [[H3312]] who were [[H4480]] among those who had spied out [[H8446]] the land, [[H776]] tore [[H7167]] their clothes [[H899]] 
7 and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “The land [[H776]] we passed through [[H5674]] and explored [[H8446]] [is] an exceedingly [[H3966]] good [[H2896]] land. [[H776]] 
8 If [[H518]] the LORD [[H3068]] is pleased with us, [[H2654]] He will bring [[H935]] us into [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] and He will give it to us. [[H5414]] 
9 Only [[H389]] do not [[H408]] rebel [[H4775]] against the LORD, [[H3068]] and do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] they will be like bread for us. [[H3899]] Their protection [[H6738]] has been removed, [[H5493]] and the LORD [[H3068]] is with us. [[H854]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid of them!” [[H3372]] 
10 But the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] threatened [[H559]] to stone [[H7275]] [Joshua and Caleb]. [[H68]] Then the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
11 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “How long [[H5704]] will this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] treat Me with contempt? [[H5006]] How long [[H5704]] will they refuse [[H3808]] to believe [[H539]] in Me,  despite all [[H3605]] the signs [[H226]] I have performed [[H6213]] among them? [[H7130]] 
12 I will strike [[H5221]] them with a plague [[H1698]] and destroy them— [[H3423]] and I will make [[H6213]] you [[H853]] into a nation [[H1471]] greater [[H1419]] and mightier [[H6099]] than they are.” [[H4480]] 
13 But Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “The Egyptians [[H4713]] will hear [[H8085]] of it, [[H3588]] for by Your strength [[H3581]] You brought [[H5927]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] from among them. [[H7130]] 
14 And they will tell it [[H559]] to [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]] They have already heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] are in the midst [[H7130]] of this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] that [[H834]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] have been seen [[H7200]] face [[H5869]] to face, [[H5869]] [that] Your cloud [[H6051]] stands [[H5975]] over them, [[H5921]] and [that] You [[H859]] go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] them in a pillar [[H5982]] of cloud [[H6051]] by day [[H3119]] and a pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] by night. [[H3915]] 
15 If You kill [[H4191]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] as one [[H259]] man, [[H376]] the nations [[H1471]] who [[H834]] have heard [[H8085]] of Your fame [[H8088]] will say, [[H559]] 
16 ‘Because the LORD [[H3068]] was unable [[H3201]] to bring [[H935]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] He swore to give them, [[H7650]] He has slaughtered [[H7819]] them in the wilderness.’ [[H4057]] 
17 So now [[H6258]] I pray, [[H4994]] may the power [[H3581]] of the Lord [[H136]] be magnified, [[H1431]] just as [[H834]] You have declared: [[H1696]] 
18 ‘The LORD [[H3068]] is slow [[H750]] to anger [[H639]] and abounding [[H7227]] in loving devotion, [[H2617]] forgiving [[H5375]] wrongdoing [[H5771]] and rebellion. [[H6588]] But He will by no means [[H3808]] leave the guilty unpunished; [[H5352]] He visits [[H6485]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the fathers [[H1]] upon [[H5921]] their children [[H1121]] to [[H5921]] the third [[H8029]] and fourth generation.’ [[H7256]] 
19 Pardon, [[H5545]] I pray, [[H4994]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] in keeping with the greatness [[H1433]] of Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] just as [[H834]] You have forgiven [[H5375]] [them] [[H5971]] ever [[H5704]] since [[H2008]] [they left] Egypt.” [[H4714]] 
20 “I have pardoned them [[H5545]] as you requested,” [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] replied. [[H559]] 
21 “Yet [[H199]] as surely as I [[H589]] live [[H2416]] and as surely as the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] is filled [[H4390]] with the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] 
22 [not one] [[H3605]] of the men [[H582]] who have seen [[H7200]] My glory [[H3519]] and the signs [[H226]] I performed [[H6213]] in Egypt [[H4714]] and in the wilderness— [[H4057]] yet have tested [[H5254]] Me [[H853]] and disobeyed [[H8085]] Me [[H6963]] these [[H2088]] ten [[H6235]] times— [[H6471]] 
23 not one [[H518]] will ever see [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] I swore [[H7650]] to give their fathers. [[H1]] None [[H3605]] of those who have treated Me with contempt [[H5006]] will see it. [[H7200]] 
24 But because [[H6118]] My servant [[H5650]] Caleb [[H3612]] has [[H1961]] a different [[H312]] spirit [[H7307]] and has followed Me [[H310]] wholeheartedly, [[H4390]] I will bring [[H935]] him into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] he has entered, [[H935]] and his descendants [[H2233]] will inherit it. [[H3423]] 
25 Now since the Amalekites [[H6003]] and Canaanites [[H3669]] are living [[H3427]] in the valleys, [[H6010]] turn back [[H6437]] tomorrow [[H4279]] and head for [[H5265]] the wilderness [[H4057]] along the route to [[H1870]] the Red [[H5488]] Sea.” [[H3220]] 
26 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
27 “How long [[H5704]] will this [[H2063]] wicked [[H7451]] congregation [[H5712]] grumble [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Me? [[H853]] I have heard [[H8085]] the complaints [[H8519]] that [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] {are making} against Me. [[H5921]] 
28 So tell them: [[H559]] As surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] I will do [[H6213]] to you  exactly [[H518]] as [[H834]] I heard [[H241]] you say. [[H1696]] 
29 Your bodies [[H6297]] will fall [[H5307]] in this [[H2088]] wilderness— [[H4057]] all [[H3605]] who were numbered [[H6485]] in the census, [[H4557]] everyone [[H3605]] twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older— [[H4605]] because [[H834]] you have grumbled [[H3885]] against Me. [[H5921]] 
30 Surely none [[H518]] of you [[H859]] will enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] in which [[H834]] I swore [[H5375]] to settle you, [[H7931]] except [[H3588]] Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] and Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun. [[H5126]] 
31 But I will bring your children, [[H2945]] whom [[H834]] you said [[H559]] would become [[H1961]] plunder, [[H957]] into [[H935]] the land [[H776]] you have rejected— [[H3988]] and they will enjoy it. [[H3045]] 
32 But as for you, [[H859]] your bodies [[H6297]] will fall [[H5307]] in this [[H2088]] wilderness. [[H4057]] 
33 Your children [[H1121]] will be [[H1961]] shepherds [[H7462]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] for forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] and they will suffer [[H5375]] [for] your unfaithfulness [[H2184]] until [[H5704]] the last [[H8552]] of your bodies [[H6297]] lie scattered in the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
34 In keeping with the [[H4557]] forty [[H705]] of days [[H3117]] you spied [[H8446]] out the land, [[H776]] you shall bear [[H5375]] your guilt [[H5771]] forty [[H705]] years— [[H8141]] a year [[H8141]] for each day— [[H8141]] and you will experience [[H3045]] My alienation. [[H8569]] 
35 I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken, [[H1696]] and I will surely [[H518]] do [[H6213]] these things [[H2063]] to this entire [[H3605]] wicked [[H7451]] congregation, [[H5712]] which has conspired [[H3259]] against Me. [[H5921]] They will meet their end [[H8552]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and there [[H8033]] they will die.” [[H4191]] 
36 So the men [[H376]] Moses [[H4872]] had sent [[H7971]] to spy [[H8446]] out the land, [[H776]] and who [[H834]] had returned [[H7725]] and made all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] grumble [[H3885]] against him [[H5921]] by bringing [[H3318]] a bad report [[H1681]] about [[H5921]] the land— [[H776]] 
37 those men who had spread [[H3318]] the bad [[H7451]] report [[H1681]] about the land [[H776]] were struck down [[H4191]] by a plague [[H4046]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3069]] 
38 Of [[H4480]] those [[H1992]] men [[H376]] who had gone [[H1980]] to spy [[H8446]] out the land, [[H776]] only Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] and Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] remained alive. [[H2421]] 
39 And when Moses [[H4872]] relayed [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] the people [[H5971]] mourned [[H56]] greatly. [[H3966]] 
40 Early the next morning [[H1242]] they got up [[H7925]] and went up [[H5927]] toward [[H413]] the ridge [[H7218]] of the hill country. [[H2022]] “We have indeed [[H2005]] sinned,” [[H2398]] they said, [[H559]] “but we will go [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] has promised.” [[H559]] 
41 But Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] are you [[H859]] transgressing [[H5674]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the LORD? [[H3068]] This [[H1931]] will not [[H3808]] succeed! [[H6743]] 
42 Do not [[H408]] go up, [[H5927]] lest [[H3808]] you be struck down [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] your enemies, [[H341]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is not [[H369]] among you. [[H7130]] 
43 For [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] the Amalekites [[H6003]] and Canaanites [[H3669]] will face you, [[H6440]] and you will fall [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]] Because [[H3588]] you have turned [[H7725]] away [[H310]] from the LORD, [[H3068]] [He] [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] with you.” [[H5973]] 
44 But they dared [[H6075]] to go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the ridge [[H7218]] of the hill country, [[H2022]] though neither [[H3808]] Moses [[H4872]] [nor] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] moved [[H4185]] from [[H7130]] the camp. [[H4264]] 
45 Then the Amalekites [[H6003]] and Canaanites [[H3669]] who lived [[H3427]] in that [[H1931]] part of the hill country [[H2022]] came down, [[H3381]] attacked them, [[H5221]] and routed them [[H3807]] all the way [[H5704]] to Hormah. [[H2767]]
