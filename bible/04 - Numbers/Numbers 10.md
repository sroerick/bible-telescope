[[Numbers 9|←]] • [[Numbers 11|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Make [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] trumpets [[H2689]] of hammered [[H4749]] silver [[H3701]] to be used [[H1961]] for calling [[H4744]] the congregation [[H5712]] and for having the camps [[H4264]] set out. [[H4550]] 
3 When both are sounded, [[H8628]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] is to assemble [[H3259]] before [[H413]] you at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
4 But if [[H518]] [only] one [[H259]] is sounded, [[H8628]] then the leaders, [[H5387]] the heads [[H7218]] of the clans [[H505]] of Israel, [[H3478]] are to gather [[H3259]] before you. [[H413]] 
5 When you sound [[H8628]] short blasts, [[H8643]] the camps [[H4264]] that lie [[H2583]] on the east side [[H6924]] are to set out. [[H5265]] 
6 When you sound [[H8628]] the short blasts [[H8643]] a second time, [[H8145]] the camps [[H4264]] that lie [[H2583]] on the south side [[H8486]] are to set out. [[H5265]] The blasts [[H8643]] are to signal them [[H8628]] to set out. [[H4550]] 
7 To convene [[H6950]] the assembly, [[H6951]] you are to sound long blasts, [[H8628]] not [[H3808]] short ones. [[H7321]] 
8 The sons [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] the priests, [[H3548]] are to sound [[H8628]] the trumpets. [[H2689]] This shall be [[H1961]] a perpetual [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for you  [and] the generations to come. [[H1755]] 
9 When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] into battle [[H4421]] in your land [[H776]] against [[H5921]] an adversary [[H6862]] who attacks [[H6887]] you, [[H853]] sound short blasts [[H7321]] on the trumpets, [[H2689]] and you will be remembered [[H2142]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and delivered [[H3467]] from your enemies. [[H341]] 
10 And on your joyous [[H8057]] occasions, [[H3117]] your appointed feasts, [[H4150]] and the beginning [[H7218]] of each month, [[H2320]] you are to blow [[H8628]] the trumpets [[H2689]] over [[H5921]] your burnt offerings [[H5930]] and fellowship [[H8002]] offerings, [[H2077]] and they will serve [[H1961]] as a reminder [[H2146]] for you before [[H6440]] your God. [[H430]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]] 
11 On the twentieth [[H6242]] day [[H2320]] of the second [[H8145]] month [[H2320]] of the second [[H8145]] year, [[H8141]] the cloud [[H6051]] was lifted [[H5927]] from above [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Testimony, [[H5715]] 
12 and the Israelites [[H1121]] set out [[H5265]] from the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai, [[H5514]] traveling from place to place [[H4550]] until the cloud [[H6051]] settled [[H7931]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran. [[H6290]] 
13 They set out, [[H5265]] this first time, [[H7223]] according to [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command [[H6310]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
14 First, [[H7223]] the divisions [[H6635]] of the camp [[H4264]] of Judah [[H1121]] set out [[H5265]] under their banner, [[H1714]] with Nahshon [[H5177]] son [[H1121]] of Amminadab [[H5992]] in command. [[H5921]] 
15 Nethanel [[H5417]] son [[H1121]] of Zuar [[H6686]] was over [[H5921]] the division [[H6635]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Issachar, [[H3485]] 
16 and Eliab [[H446]] son [[H1121]] of Helon [[H2497]] was over [[H5921]] the division [[H6635]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Zebulun. [[H2074]] 
17 Then the tabernacle [[H4908]] was taken down, [[H3381]] and the Gershonites [[H1121]] and the Merarites [[H1121]] set out, [[H5265]] transporting [[H5375]] [it]. [[H4908]] 
18 Then the divisions [[H6635]] of the camp [[H4264]] of Reuben [[H7205]] set out, [[H5265]] under their banner, [[H1714]] with Elizur [[H468]] son [[H1121]] of Shedeur [[H7707]] in command. [[H5921]] 
19 Shelumiel [[H8017]] son [[H1121]] of Zurishaddai [[H6701]] was over [[H5921]] the division [[H6635]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Simeon, [[H8095]] 
20 and Eliasaph [[H460]] son [[H1121]] of Deuel [[H1845]] was over [[H5921]] the division [[H6635]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Gad. [[H1121]] 
21 Then the Kohathites [[H6956]] set out, [[H5265]] transporting [[H5375]] the holy objects; [[H4720]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] was to be set up [[H6965]] before [[H5704]] their arrival. [[H935]] 
22 Next, the divisions [[H6635]] of the camp [[H4264]] of Ephraim [[H1121]] set out, [[H5265]] under their banner, [[H1714]] with Elishama [[H476]] son [[H1121]] of Ammihud [[H5989]] in command. [[H5921]] 
23 Gamaliel [[H1583]] son [[H1121]] of Pedahzur [[H6301]] was over [[H5921]] the division [[H6635]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Manasseh, [[H1121]] 
24 and Abidan [[H27]] son [[H1121]] of Gideoni [[H1441]] was over [[H5921]] the division [[H6635]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]] 
25 Finally, the divisions [[H6635]] of the camp [[H4264]] of Dan [[H1121]] set out, [[H5265]] under their banner, [[H1714]] serving as the rear guard [[H622]] for all [[H3605]] units, [[H4264]] with Ahiezer [[H295]] son [[H1121]] of Ammishaddai [[H5996]] in command. [[H5921]] 
26 Pagiel [[H6295]] son [[H1121]] of Ocran [[H5918]] was over [[H5921]] the division [[H6635]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Asher, [[H1121]] 
27 and Ahira [[H299]] son [[H1121]] of Enan [[H5881]] was over [[H5921]] the division [[H6635]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Naphtali. [[H1121]] 
28 This [[H428]] was the order of march [[H4550]] for the Israelite [[H1121]] divisions [[H6635]] as they set out. [[H5265]] 
29 Then Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to Hobab, [[H2246]] son [[H1121]] of [his] [[H4872]] father-in-law [[H2859]] Reuel [[H7467]] the Midianite, [[H4084]] “We are [[H587]] setting out [[H5265]] for [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] said: [[H559]] ‘I will give it to you.’ [[H5414]] Come [[H1980]] with us, [[H854]] and we will treat you well, [[H3190]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has promised [[H1696]] good [[H2896]] things to [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
30 “I will not [[H3808]] go,” [[H1980]] [Hobab] replied. [[H559]] “Instead, [[H3588]] I am going back [[H1980]] to [[H413]] my own land [[H776]] and my own people.” [[H4138]] 
31 “Please [[H4994]] do not [[H408]] leave us,” [[H5800]] Moses said, [[H559]] “since [[H3588]] you know [[H3045]] where we should camp [[H2583]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and you can serve [[H1961]] as our eyes. [[H5869]] 
32 If [[H3588]] you come [[H1980]] with us, [[H5973]] we will share [[H3190]] with you  whatever [[H834]] good things [[H2896]] the LORD [[H3068]] gives us.” [[H5973]] 
33 So they set out [[H5265]] on a three-day [[H7969]] journey [[H1870]] from the mountain [[H2022]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] with the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] traveling [[H5265]] ahead of them [[H6440]] for those three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] to seek [[H8446]] a resting place [[H4496]] for them.  
34 And the cloud [[H6051]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was over [[H5921]] them by day [[H3119]] when they set out [[H5265]] from [[H4480]] the camp. [[H4264]] 
35 Whenever [[H1961]] the ark [[H727]] set out, [[H5265]] Moses [[H4872]] would say, [[H559]] “Rise up, [[H6965]] O LORD! [[H3068]] May Your enemies [[H341]] be scattered; [[H6327]] may those who hate You [[H8130]] flee [[H5127]] before You.” [[H6440]] 
36 And when it came to rest, [[H5117]] he would say: [[H559]] “Return, [[H7725]] O LORD, [[H3068]] to the countless [[H7233]] thousands [[H505]] of Israel.” [[H3478]]
