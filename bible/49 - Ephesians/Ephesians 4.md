[[Ephesians 3|←]] • [[Ephesians 5|→]]
1 [As a] [[G3588]] prisoner [[G1198]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] then, [[G3767]] I [[G1473]] urge [[G3870]] you [[G4771]] to walk [[G4043]] in a manner worthy [[G516]] of the [[G3588]] calling [[G2821]] you have received: [[G2564]] 
2 with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] humility [[G5012]] and [[G2532]] gentleness, [[G4240]] with [[G3326]] patience, [[G3115]] bearing with [[G430]] one another [[G240]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] 
3 [and] with diligence [[G4704]] to preserve [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] unity [[G1775]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] through [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] bond [[G4886]] of peace. [[G1515]] 
4 [There is] one [[G1520]] body [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] Spirit, [[G4151]] just as [[G2531]] you were called [[G2564]] to [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] hope [[G1680]] [when] [[G3588]] you [[G4771]] were called; [[G2821]] 
5 one [[G1520]] Lord, [[G2962]] one [[G1520]] faith, [[G4102]] one [[G1520]] baptism; [[G908]] 
6 one [[G1520]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] of all, [[G3956]] who [is] [[G3588]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] all [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] all. [[G3956]] 
7 Now [[G1161]] to each [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of us [[G1473]] grace [[G5485]] has been given [[G1325]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] measure [[G3358]] of the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] of Christ. [[G5547]] 
8 This is why [[G1352]] it says: [[G3004]] “When He ascended [[G305]] on [[G1519]] high, [[G5311]] He led [[G162]] captives away, [[G161]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] gifts [[G1390]] to men.” [[G444]] 
9 What [[G5101]] [does] [[G1510]] “He ascended” [mean], [[G305]] except [[G1487]] that [[G3754]] He also descended [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lower [[G2737]] parts [[G3313]] of the [[G3588]] earth? [[G1093]] 
10 He who [[G3588]] descended [[G2597]] is [[G1510]] the very [[G846]] [one] [[G3588]] who ascended [[G305]] above [[G5231]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] heavens, [[G3772]] in order [[G2443]] to fill [[G4137]] all things. [[G3956]] 
11 And [[G2532]] [it was] He who [[G846]] gave [[G1325]] some [[G3588]] [to be] apostles, [[G652]] some [[G3588]] [to be] prophets, [[G4396]] some [[G3588]] [to be] evangelists, [[G2099]] and [[G1161]] some [[G3588]] [to be] pastors [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] teachers, [[G1320]] 
12 to equip [[G2677]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] for [[G1519]] works [[G2041]] of ministry, [[G1248]] to [[G1519]] build up [[G3619]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Christ, [[G5547]] 
13 until [[G3360]] we all reach [[G2658]] unity [[G1775]] in the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] in the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1922]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] [as we] mature [[G5046]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] full [[G4138]] measure [[G3358]] of [the] stature [[G2244]] of Christ. [[G5547]] 
14 Then [[G2443]] {we will} no longer [[G3371]] be [[G1510]] infants, [[G3516]] tossed about by the waves [[G2831]] and [[G2532]] carried around [[G4064]] by every [[G3956]] wind [[G417]] of teaching [[G1319]] [and] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] clever [[G3834]] cunning [[G2940]] of men [[G444]] in [[G4314]] [their] [[G3588]] deceitful [[G4106]] scheming. [[G3180]] 
15 Instead, [[G1161]] speaking the truth [[G226]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] {we will} in [[G3588]] all things [[G3956]] grow up [[G837]] into [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] Himself, [[G846]] who [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] head. [[G2776]] 
16 From [[G1537]] [Him] [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] body [[G4983]] [is] fitted [[G4883]] and [[G2532]] held together [[G4822]] by [[G1223]] every [[G3956]] supporting [[G2024]] ligament. [[G860]] [And as] each [[G1538]] individual [[G1520]] part [[G3313]] does its work, [[G1753]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] grows [[G838]] [and] builds itself up [[G3619]] in [[G1722]] love. [[G26]] 
17 So [[G3767]] I tell [you] [[G3004]] this, [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] testify [to it] [[G3143]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord: [[G2962]] You {must} [[G4771]] no longer [[G3371]] walk [[G4043]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] do, [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] [the] futility [[G3153]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] thinking. [[G3563]] 
18 They are darkened [[G4656]] in [their] [[G3588]] understanding [[G1271]] [and] [[G1510]] alienated from [[G526]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] of God [[G2316]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] ignorance [[G52]] that is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] them [[G846]] due to [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] hardness [[G4457]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] hearts. [[G2588]] 
19 Having lost all sense of shame, [[G524]] [they] [[G3748]] have given themselves over [[G3860]] to [[G3588]] sensuality [[G766]] for [[G1519]] [the] practice [[G2039]] of every kind [[G3956]] of impurity, [[G167]] with [[G1722]] a craving for more. [[G4124]] 
20 But [[G1161]] this is not the way [[G3779]] you [[G4771]] came to know [[G3129]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
21 Surely [[G1487]] you heard of [[G191]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] were taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] Him, [[G846]] in keeping with [[G2531]] [the] truth [[G225]] that is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Jesus, [[G2424]] 
22 to put off [[G659]] your [[G4771]] former [[G4386]] way of life, [[G391]] [your] [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] self, [[G444]] which [[G3588]] is being corrupted [[G5351]] by [[G2596]] [its] [[G3588]] deceitful [[G539]] desires; [[G1939]] 
23 to be renewed [[G365]] in the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] minds; [[G3563]] 
24 and [[G2532]] to put on [[G1746]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] self, [[G444]] created [[G2936]] to be like [[G2596]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] TRUE [[G225]] righteousness [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] holiness. [[G3742]] 
25 Therefore [[G1352]] each [of you] [[G1538]] must put off [[G659]] falsehood [[G5579]] [and] speak [[G2980]] truthfully [[G225]] to [[G3326]] his [[G846]] neighbor, [[G4139]] for [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] members [[G3196]] of one another. [[G240]] 
26 “Be angry, [[G3710]] yet [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] sin.” [[G264]] {Do} not {let} [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] set [[G1931]] upon [[G1909]] your [[G4771]] anger, [[G3950]] 
27 [and] {do} not [[G3366]] give [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] a foothold. [[G5117]] 
28 He who [[G3588]] has been stealing [[G2813]] must steal [[G2813]] no longer, [[G3371]] but [[G1161]] must work, [[G2872]] doing [[G2038]] good [[G18]] with [[G3588]] [his] own [[G2398]] hands, [[G5495]] that [[G2443]] he may have [something] [[G2192]] to share with [[G3330]] the [one] [[G3588]] [in] [[G2192]] need. [[G5532]] 
29 {Let} no [[G3361]] unwholesome [[G4550]] talk [[G3056]] come [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] mouths, [[G4750]] but [[G235]] only [[G1487]] what is [[G5100]] helpful [[G18]] for [[G4314]] building up [[G3619]] the [one] [[G3588]] in need [[G5532]] [and] [[G2443]] bringing [[G1325]] grace [[G5485]] to those [[G3588]] who listen. [[G191]] 
30 And [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] grieve [[G3076]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] of God, [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] you were sealed [[G4972]] for [[G1519]] [the] day [[G2250]] of redemption. [[G629]] 
31 Get rid of [[G142]] all [[G3956]] bitterness, [[G4088]] rage [[G2372]] and [[G2532]] anger, [[G3709]] outcry [[G2906]] and [[G2532]] slander, [[G988]] along with [[G4862]] every form [[G3956]] of malice. [[G2549]] 
32 Be [[G1096]] kind [[G5543]] [and] tender-hearted [[G2155]] to [[G1519]] one another, [[G240]] forgiving [[G5483]] each other [[G1438]] just [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] God [[G2316]] forgave [[G5483]] you. [[G4771]]
