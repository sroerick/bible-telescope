1 For this reason, [[G5484]] I, [[G1473]] Paul, [[G3972]] the [[G3588]] prisoner [[G1198]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] for the sake of [[G5228]] you [[G4771]] Gentiles... [[G1484]] 
2 Surely [[G1065]] you have heard about [[G191]] the [[G3588]] stewardship [[G3622]] of God’s [[G2316]] grace [[G5485]] that was given [[G1325]] to me [[G1473]] for [[G1519]] you, [[G4771]] 
3 that [is], [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] made known [[G1107]] to me [[G1473]] by [[G2596]] revelation, [[G602]] as [[G2531]] I have already written [[G4270]] briefly. [[G3641]] 
4 In [[G4314]] reading [[G314]] this, then, [[G3739]] you will be able to [[G1410]] understand [[G3539]] my [[G1473]] insight [[G4907]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of Christ, [[G5547]] 
5 which [[G3739]] was not made known [[G1107]] to men [[G444]] in other [[G2087]] generations [[G1074]] as [[G5613]] it has now been revealed [[G601]] by [[G1722]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] to [[G3588]] [God’s] [[G846]] holy [[G40]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] prophets. [[G4396]] 
6 [This mystery is that] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] are [[G1510]] fellow heirs, [[G4789]] fellow members of the body, [[G4954]] and [[G2532]] fellow partakers [[G4830]] of the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
7 I became [[G1096]] a servant [[G1249]] of [this gospel] [[G3739]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] of God’s [[G2316]] grace, [[G5485]] given [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] through [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] working [[G1753]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] power. [[G1411]] 
8 [Though I am] [[G3588]] less than the least [[G1647]] of all [[G3956]] [the] saints, [[G40]] this [[G3778]] grace [[G5485]] was given [[G1325]] me: [[G1473]] to preach [[G2097]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] the [[G3588]] unsearchable [[G421]] riches [[G4149]] of Christ, [[G5547]] 
9 and [[G2532]] to illuminate [[G5461]] for everyone [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] stewardship [[G3622]] of [this] [[G3588]] mystery, [[G3466]] which [[G3588]] for [[G575]] ages past [[G165]] was hidden [[G613]] in [[G1722]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] created [[G2936]] all things. [[G3956]] 
10 [ His purpose was ] that [[G2443]] now, [[G3568]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] the [[G3588]] manifold [[G4182]] wisdom [[G4678]] of God [[G2316]] should be made known [[G1107]] to the [[G3588]] rulers [[G746]] and [[G2532]] authorities [[G1849]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heavenly realms, [[G2032]] 
11 according to [[G2596]] [the] eternal [[G165]] purpose [[G4286]] that [[G3739]] He accomplished [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
12 In [[G1722]] Him [[G3739]] [and] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] in Him [[G846]] we may [[G2192]] enter [ God’s ] presence [[G4318]] with boldness [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] confidence. [[G4006]] 
13 So [[G1352]] I ask [you] [[G154]] not [[G3361]] to be discouraged [[G1573]] because of [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] sufferings [[G2347]] for [[G5228]] you, [[G4771]] which [[G3748]] are [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] glory. [[G1391]] 
14 for this reason [[G5484]] I bow [[G2578]] my [[G1473]] knees [[G1119]] before [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] 
15 from [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] every [[G3956]] family [[G3965]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] derives its name. [[G3687]] 
16 [ I pray ] that [[G2443]] out of [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] riches [[G4149]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] He may [[G1325]] strengthen [[G2901]] you [[G4771]] with power [[G1411]] through [[G1223]] His [[G846]] Spirit [[G4151]] in [[G1519]] [your] [[G3588]] inner [[G2080]] being, [[G444]] 
17 so that [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] may dwell [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] through [[G1223]] faith. [[G4102]] [And I pray that] you, being rooted [[G4492]] and [[G2532]] grounded [[G2311]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] 
18 may have power, [[G1840]] together with [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] to comprehend [[G2638]] the [[G3588]] length [[G3372]] and [[G2532]] width [[G4114]] and [[G2532]] height [[G5311]] and [[G2532]] depth [of His love], [[G899]] 
19 and [[G5037]] to know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of Christ [[G5547]] [that] surpasses [[G5235]] knowledge, [[G1108]] that [[G2443]] you may be filled [[G4137]] with [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] fullness [[G4138]] of God. [[G2316]] 
20 Now [[G1161]] to [Him] who [[G3588]] is able [[G1410]] to do [[G4160]] infinitely [[G5228]] more than [[G5228]] all [[G3956]] we ask [[G154]] or [[G2228]] imagine, [[G3539]] according to [[G2596]] [His] [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] that [[G3588]] is at work [[G1754]] within [[G1722]] us, [[G1473]] 
21 to Him [be] [[G846]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] throughout [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] generations, [[G1074]] forever [[G3588]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]
