[[Ephesians 4|←]] • [[Ephesians 6|→]]
1 Be [[G1096]] imitators [[G3402]] of God, [[G2316]] therefore, [[G3767]] as [[G5613]] beloved [[G27]] children, [[G5043]] 
2 and [[G2532]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] just as [[G2531]] Christ [[G5547]] loved [[G25]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] gave Himself up [[G3860]] for [[G5228]] us [[G1473]] as [[G1519]] a fragrant [[G2175]] sacrificial [[G2378]] offering [[G4376]] to God. [[G2316]] 
3 But [[G1161]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] as [[G2531]] is proper [[G4241]] among the saints, [[G40]] there must not be even a hint [[G3687]] of sexual immorality, [[G4202]] [or] [[G2532]] of any kind [[G3956]] of impurity, [[G167]] or [[G2228]] of greed. [[G4124]] 
4 [Nor should there be] [[G2532]] obscenity, [[G151]] foolish talk, [[G3473]] or [[G2228]] crude joking, [[G2160]] which [[G3739]] are out of character, [[G433]] but [[G235]] rather [[G3123]] thanksgiving. [[G2169]] 
5 For [[G1063]] of this [[G3778]] you can be sure: [[G1097]] [No] [[G3956]] immoral, [[G4205]] impure, [[G169]] or [[G2228]] greedy person [[G4123]] (that [[G3739]] is, [[G1510]] an idolater), [[G1496]] has [[G2192]] [any] [[G3756]] inheritance [[G2817]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] of God. [[G2316]] 
6 {Let} no one [[G3367]] deceive [[G538]] you [[G4771]] with empty [[G2756]] words, [[G3056]] for [[G1063]] because of [[G1223]] such things [[G3778]] God’s [[G2316]] wrath [[G3709]] comes [[G2064]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of disobedience. [[G543]] 
7 Therefore [[G3767]] {do} not [[G3361]] be [[G1096]] partakers [[G4830]] with them. [[G846]] 
8 For [[G1063]] you were [[G1510]] once [[G4218]] darkness, [[G4655]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] [you are] light [[G5457]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] Walk [[G4043]] as [[G5613]] children [[G5043]] of light, [[G5457]] 
9 for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] of the [[G3588]] light [consists] [[G5457]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] goodness, [[G19]] righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] truth. [[G225]] 
10 Test and prove [[G1381]] what [[G5101]] pleases [[G2101]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
11 Have no fellowship with [[G4790]] the [[G3588]] fruitless [[G175]] deeds [[G2041]] of darkness, [[G4655]] but [[G1161]] rather [[G3123]] expose [them]. [[G1651]] 
12 For [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] shameful [[G150]] even [[G2532]] to mention [[G3004]] what [[G3588]] [the disobedient] do [[G1096]] in secret. [[G2931]] 
13 But [[G1161]] everything [[G3956]] exposed [[G1651]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] becomes visible, [[G5319]] for [[G1063]] everything [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] is illuminated [[G5319]] becomes [[G1510]] a light [itself]. [[G5457]] 
14 So [[G1352]] it is said: [[G3004]] “Wake up, [[G1453]] O [[G3588]] sleeper, [[G2518]] rise up [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] will shine on [[G2017]] you.” [[G4771]] 
15 Pay careful [[G199]] attention, [[G991]] then, [[G3767]] to how [[G4459]] you walk, [[G4043]] not [[G3361]] as [[G5613]] unwise [[G781]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] wise, [[G4680]] 
16 redeeming [[G1805]] the [[G3588]] time, [[G2540]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] are [[G1510]] evil. [[G4190]] 
17 Therefore [[G1223]] {do} not [[G3361]] be [[G1096]] foolish, [[G878]] but [[G235]] understand [[G4920]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] will [is]. [[G2307]] 
18 {Do} not [[G3361]] get drunk [[G3182]] on wine, [[G3631]] which [[G3739]] leads to [[G1510]] reckless indiscretion. [[G810]] Instead, [[G235]] be filled [[G4137]] with [[G1722]] [the] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
19 Speak [[G2980]] to one another [[G1438]] with [[G1722]] psalms, [[G5568]] hymns, [[G5215]] and [[G2532]] spiritual [[G4152]] songs. [[G5603]] Sing [[G103]] and [[G2532]] make music [[G5567]] in [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] to the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] 
20 always [[G3842]] giving thanks [[G2168]] to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] for [[G5228]] everything [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
21 Submit [[G5293]] to one another [[G240]] out of [[G1722]] reverence [[G5401]] for Christ. [[G5547]] 
22 Wives, [[G1135]] [submit] to [[G3588]] your [[G2398]] husbands [[G435]] as [[G5613]] to the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
23 For [[G3754]] [the] husband [[G435]] is [[G1510]] head [[G2776]] of the [[G3588]] wife, [[G1135]] just [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] Christ [[G5547]] [is the] head [[G2776]] of the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] [His] [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] [of which] He [[G846]] [is the] Savior. [[G4990]] 
24 Now [[G235]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] submits [[G5293]] to Christ, [[G5547]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] wives [should submit] [[G1135]] to their [[G3588]] husbands [[G435]] in [[G1722]] everything. [[G3956]] 
25 Husbands, [[G435]] love [[G25]] [your] [[G3588]] wives, [[G1135]] just [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] Christ [[G5547]] loved [[G25]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] gave Himself up [[G3860]] for [[G5228]] her [[G846]] 
26 to [[G2443]] sanctify [[G37]] her, [[G846]] cleansing [her] [[G2511]] by the [[G3588]] washing [[G3067]] with water [[G5204]] through [[G1722]] [the] word, [[G4487]] 
27 [and] to [[G2443]] present [[G3936]] her [[G846]] to Himself [[G1438]] as a glorious [[G1741]] church, [[G1577]] without [[G2192]] stain [[G4696]] or [[G2228]] wrinkle [[G4512]] or [[G2228]] any [[G5100]] such [blemish], [[G5108]] but [[G235]] holy [[G40]] and [[G2532]] blameless. [[G299]] 
28 In the same way, [[G3779]] husbands [[G435]] ought [[G3784]] to love [[G25]] their [[G1438]] wives [[G1135]] as [[G5613]] their own [[G1438]] bodies. [[G4983]] He [[G3588]] who loves [[G25]] his [[G1438]] wife [[G1135]] loves [[G25]] himself. [[G1438]] 
29 Indeed, [[G1063]] no one [[G3762]] ever [[G4218]] hated [[G3404]] his [[G1438]] [own] [[G3588]] body, [[G4561]] but [[G235]] he nourishes [[G1625]] and [[G2532]] cherishes [[G2282]] it, [[G846]] just as [[G2531]] Christ [[G5547]] [does] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]] 
30 For [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] members [[G3196]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] body. [[G4983]] 
31 “For this reason [[G473]] a man [[G444]] will leave [[G2641]] his [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] be united [[G4347]] to [[G4314]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] will become [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] flesh.” [[G4561]] 
32 This [[G3778]] mystery [[G3466]] is [[G1510]] profound, [[G3173]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] am speaking [[G3004]] about [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]] 
33 Nevertheless, [[G4133]] each one [[G1538]] of you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] must love [[G25]] his [[G1438]] wife [[G1135]] as [he loves] [[G5613]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] wife [[G1135]] must respect [[G5399]] [her] [[G3588]] husband. [[G435]]
