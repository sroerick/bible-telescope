# Ephesians 6
[[Ephesians 5|←]] • [[Philippians 1|→]]
1 Children, [[G5043]] obey [[G5219]] your [[G4771]] parents [[G1118]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] for [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] right. [[G1342]] 
2 “Honor [[G5091]] your [[G4771]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother” [[G3384]] (which [[G3748]] is [[G1510]] the first [[G4413]] commandment [[G1785]] with [[G1722]] a promise), [[G1860]] 
3 “that [[G2443]] it may go [[G1096]] well [[G2095]] with you [[G4771]] and [that] [[G2532]] you may have [[G1510]] a long life [[G3118]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth.” [[G1093]] 
4 Fathers, [[G3962]] {do} not [[G3361]] provoke [[G3949]] your [[G4771]] children {to anger}; [[G5043]] instead, [[G235]] bring them up [[G1625]] in [[G1722]] [the] discipline [[G3809]] and [[G2532]] instruction [[G3559]] of [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
5 Slaves, [[G1401]] obey [[G5219]] [your] [[G3588]] earthly [[G2596]] masters [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] respect [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] fear [[G5156]] [and] [[G1722]] sincerity [[G572]] of [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] just as [ you would show ] [[G5613]] to [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
6 [And do this] not only [[G3361]] to please them [[G441]] while they are watching, [[G3787]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] servants of [[G1401]] Christ, [[G5547]] doing [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of God [[G2316]] from [[G1537]] [your] heart. [[G5590]] 
7 Serve [[G1398]] with [[G3326]] good will, [[G2133]] as [[G5613]] to the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] to men, [[G444]] 
8 because you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] will reward [[G2865]] each one [[G1538]] for whatever [[G5100]] good [[G18]] he does, [[G4160]] whether [[G1535]] [he is] slave [[G1401]] or [[G1535]] free. [[G1658]] 
9 And [[G2532]] masters, [[G2962]] do [[G4160]] the same [[G3588]] for [[G4314]] [your slaves]. [[G846]] Give up [[G447]] [your] [[G3588]] use of threats, [[G547]] because you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [He who is] both [[G2532]] their [[G846]] Master [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] yours [[G4771]] is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] favoritism [[G4382]] with [[G3844]] Him. [[G846]] 
10 Finally, [[G3064]] be strong [[G1743]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] mighty [[G2904]] power. [[G2479]] 
11 Put on [[G1746]] the [[G3588]] full armor [[G3833]] of God, [[G2316]] so that [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] can [[G1410]] make your stand [[G2476]] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] devil’s [[G1228]] schemes. [[G3180]] 
12 For [[G3754]] our [[G1473]] struggle [[G3823]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] against [[G4314]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood, [[G129]] but [[G235]] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] rulers, [[G746]] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] authorities, [[G1849]] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] powers [[G2888]] of [[G3588]] this {world's} [[G3778]] darkness, [[G4655]] [and] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] spiritual [forces] [[G4152]] of evil [[G4189]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heavenly realms. [[G2032]] 
13 Therefore [[G1223]] take up [[G353]] the [[G3588]] full armor [[G3833]] of God, [[G2316]] so that [[G2443]] when [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of evil {comes}, [[G4190]] you will be able [[G1410]] to stand your ground, [[G436]] and [[G2532]] having done [[G2716]] everything, [[G537]] to stand. [[G2476]] 
14 Stand firm [[G2476]] then, [[G3767]] with [[G1722]] {the belt of} truth [[G225]] fastened around [[G4024]] your [[G4771]] waist, [[G3751]] [with] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] breastplate [[G2382]] of righteousness [[G1343]] arrayed, [[G1746]] 
15 and [[G2532]] [with your] [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] fitted [[G5265]] with [[G1722]] [the] readiness [[G2091]] of the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of peace. [[G1515]] 
16 In addition to [[G1722]] all [this], [[G3956]] take up [[G353]] the [[G3588]] shield [[G2375]] of faith, [[G4102]] with [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] you can [[G1410]] extinguish [[G4570]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] flaming [[G4448]] arrows [[G956]] of the [[G3588]] evil one. [[G4190]] 
17 And [[G2532]] take [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] helmet [[G4030]] of salvation [[G4992]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sword [[G3162]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] word [[G4487]] of God. [[G2316]] 
18 Pray [[G4336]] in [[G1722]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] at [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] times, [[G2540]] with [[G1223]] every kind of [[G3956]] prayer [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] petition. [[G1162]] To [[G1519]] this [end], [[G846]] stay alert [[G69]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] perseverance [[G4343]] in your prayers [[G1162]] for [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]] 
19 [Pray] also [[G2532]] for [[G5228]] me, [[G1473]] that [[G2443]] whenever [[G1722]] I open [[G457]] my [[G1473]] mouth, [[G4750]] divine utterance [[G3056]] may be given [[G1325]] me, [[G1473]] [so that I will] boldly [[G3954]] make known [[G1107]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] 
20 for [[G5228]] which [[G3739]] I am an ambassador [[G4243]] in [[G1722]] chains. [[G254]] [Pray] that [[G2443]] I may proclaim it fearlessly, [[G3955]] as [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] should. [[G1163]] 
21 Tychicus, [[G5190]] the [[G3588]] beloved [[G27]] brother [[G80]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] servant [[G1249]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] will tell [[G1107]] you [[G4771]] everything, [[G3956]] so that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] may know [[G1492]] about [[G2596]] me [[G1473]] [and] what [[G5101]] I am doing. [[G4238]] 
22 I have sent [[G3992]] [him] [[G3739]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] for [[G1519]] this very [[G846]] purpose, [[G3778]] that [[G2443]] you may know [[G1097]] about [[G4012]] us, [[G1473]] and [that] [[G2532]] he may encourage [[G3870]] your [[G4771]] hearts. [[G2588]] 
23 Peace [[G1515]] to the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] and [[G2532]] love [[G26]] with [[G3326]] faith [[G4102]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
24 Grace [[G5485]] [be] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] love [[G25]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] with [[G1722]] an undying [love]. [[G861]]
