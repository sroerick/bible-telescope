# Acts 16
[[Acts 15|←]] • [[Acts 17|→]]
1 [Paul] came [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Derbe [[G1191]] and then [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] Lystra, [[G3082]] [where] [[G1563]] [he found] [[G2400]] a [[G5100]] disciple [[G3101]] named [[G3686]] Timothy, [[G5095]] [the] son [[G5207]] of a believing [[G4103]] Jewish [[G2453]] woman [[G1135]] and [[G1161]] a Greek [[G1672]] father. [[G3962]] 
2 The [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] in [[G1722]] Lystra [[G3082]] and [[G2532]] Iconium [[G2430]] spoke well of [[G3140]] [him]. [[G3739]] 
3 Paul [[G3972]] wanted [[G2309]] [Timothy] [[G3778]] to accompany [[G1831]] him, [[G846]] [so] [[G2532]] he took [him] [[G2983]] [and] circumcised [[G4059]] him [[G846]] on account of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] area, [[G5117]] for [[G1063]] they all knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] was [[G5225]] a Greek. [[G1672]] 
4 As [[G5613]] they went from [[G1279]] town to town, [[G4172]] they delivered [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] decisions [[G1378]] handed down [[G2919]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] for [the people] [[G846]] to obey. [[G5442]] 
5 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] were strengthened [[G4732]] in the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] grew [[G4052]] daily [[G2250]] in numbers. [[G706]] 
6 {After] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] prevented them [[G2967]] from speaking [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] [the province of] Asia, [[G773]] they traveled through [[G1330]] the [[G3588]] region [[G5561]] of Phrygia [[G5435]] and [[G2532]] Galatia. [[G1054]] 
7 And [[G1161]] when they came [[G2064]] to the border of [[G2596]] Mysia, [[G3465]] they tried [[G3985]] to enter [[G4198]] Bithynia, [[G978]] [but] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of Jesus [[G2424]] would not permit [[G1439]] them. [[G846]] 
8 [So] [[G1161]] they passed by [[G3928]] Mysia [[G3465]] [and] went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Troas. [[G5174]] 
9 During [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] night, [[G3571]] Paul [[G3972]] had [[G3708]] a vision [[G3705]] of a [[G5100]] man [[G435]] of Macedonia [[G3110]] standing [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] pleading with [[G3870]] him, [[G846]] “Come over [[G1224]] to [[G1519]] Macedonia [[G3109]] [and] help [[G997]] us.” [[G1473]] 
10 As soon as [[G5613]] [Paul] had seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] vision, [[G3705]] we got ready [[G2212]] to leave [[G1831]] for [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] concluding [[G4822]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] had called [[G4341]] us [[G1473]] to preach the gospel [[G2097]] to them. [[G846]] 
11 We sailed [[G321]] from [[G575]] Troas [[G5174]] straight [[G2113]] to [[G1519]] Samothrace, [[G4543]] and [[G1161]] on the [[G3588]] following day [[G1966]] on to [[G1519]] Neapolis. [[G3501]] 
12 From there, [[G2547]] [we went] to [[G1519]] [the Roman] colony [[G2862]] of Philippi, [[G5375]] [the] leading [[G4413]] city [[G4172]] of [that] [[G3588]] district [[G3310]] of Macedonia. [[G3109]] And [[G1161]] we stayed [[G1304]] [there] [[G4172]] [several] [[G5100]] days. [[G2250]] 
13 On the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] we went [[G1831]] outside [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city gate [[G4439]] along [[G3844]] [the] river, [[G4215]] where [it] [[G3757]] was customary [[G3543]] to find [[G1510]] [a place of] prayer. [[G4335]] [After] [[G2532]] sitting down, [[G2523]] we spoke [[G2980]] to the [[G3588]] women [[G1135]] who had gathered [there]. [[G4905]] 
14 Among [[G5100]] those listening [[G191]] [was a] woman [[G1135]] named [[G3686]] Lydia, [[G3070]] a dealer in purple [cloth] [[G4211]] from [the] city [[G4172]] of Thyatira, [[G2363]] [who was] a worshiper [[G4576]] of [[G3588]] God. [[G2316]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] opened [[G1272]] her [[G3739]] heart [[G2588]] to respond [[G4337]] to [[G3588]] Paul’s [[G3972]] message. [[G2980]] 
15 And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] [she] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] household [[G3624]] had been baptized, [[G907]] she urged [us], [[G3870]] “If [[G1487]] you consider [[G2919]] me [[G1473]] a believer [[G4103]] in the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] come [[G1525]] [and] stay [[G3306]] at [[G1519]] my [[G1473]] house.” [[G3624]] And [[G2532]] she persuaded [[G3849]] us. [[G1473]] 
16 One day [[G1161]] as we [[G1473]] were going [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] [place of] prayer, [[G4335]] we [[G1473]] were met by [[G5221]] a [[G5100]] slave girl [[G3814]] with [[G2192]] a spirit [[G4151]] of clairvoyance, [[G4436]] who [[G3748]] earned [[G3930]] a large [[G4183]] income [[G2039]] for her [[G846]] masters [[G2962]] by fortune-telling. [[G3132]] 
17 [This girl] [[G3778]] followed [[G2628]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] [the rest of] us, [[G1473]] shouting, [[G2896]] “These [[G3778]] men [[G444]] are [[G1510]] servants [[G1401]] of the [[G3588]] Most High [[G5310]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3748]] are proclaiming [[G2605]] to you [[G4771]] [the] way [[G3598]] of salvation.” [[G4991]] 
18 She continued [[G4160]] this [[G3778]] for [[G1909]] many [[G4183]] days. [[G2250]] [Eventually] [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] grew so aggravated [[G1278]] [that] [[G2532]] he turned [[G1994]] [and] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] spirit, [[G4151]] “In [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] I command [[G3853]] you [[G4771]] to come out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] her! [[G846]] And [[G2532]] [the spirit] left her [[G1831]] at that [[G846]] very moment. [[G5610]] 
19 [When] [[G1161]] [the girl’s] [[G846]] owners [[G2962]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] their [[G846]] hope [[G1680]] of [[G3588]] making money [[G2039]] was gone, [[G1831]] they seized [[G1949]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas [[G4609]] [and] dragged [them] [[G1670]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] authorities [[G758]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] marketplace. [[G58]] 
20 They brought them [[G4317]] to the [[G3588]] magistrates [[G4755]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “These [[G3778]] men [[G444]] are [[G5225]] Jews [[G2453]] [and] are throwing [[G1613]] our [[G1473]] city {into turmoil} [[G4172]] 
21 [by] [[G2532]] promoting [[G2605]] customs [[G1485]] that [[G3739]] are unlawful [[G1832]] for us [[G1473]] Romans [[G4514]] to adopt [[G3858]] [or] [[G3761]] practice.” [[G4160]] 
22 The [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] joined in the attack [[G4911]] against [[G2596]] [Paul and Silas], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] magistrates [[G4755]] ordered that [[G2753]] they be stripped [[G4048]] [and] beaten with rods. [[G4463]] 
23 And [[G5037]] after striking [[G2007]] them [[G846]] with many [[G4183]] blows, [[G4127]] they threw [them] [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison [[G5438]] [and] ordered [[G3853]] the [[G3588]] jailer [[G1200]] to guard [[G5083]] them [[G846]] securely. [[G806]] 
24 On receiving [[G2983]] [this] [[G5108]] order, [[G3852]] he placed [[G906]] them [[G846]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] inner [[G2082]] cell [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] fastened [[G805]] their [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] stocks. [[G3586]] 
25 About [[G2596]] midnight, [[G3317]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas [[G4609]] were praying [[G4336]] [and] singing hymns [[G5214]] to [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] [other] prisoners [[G1198]] were listening [[G1874]] to them. [[G846]] 
26 Suddenly [[G869]] a strong [[G3173]] earthquake [[G4578]] shook [[G4531]] the [[G3588]] foundations [[G2310]] of the [[G3588]] prison. [[G1201]] At once [[G3916]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] doors [[G2374]] flew open, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] everyone’s [[G3956]] chains [[G1199]] came loose. [[G447]] 
27 [When] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] jailer [[G1200]] woke up [[G1853]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] prison [[G5438]] doors [[G2374]] open, [[G455]] he drew [[G4685]] his [[G3588]] sword [[G3162]] [and] was about [[G3195]] to kill [[G337]] himself, [[G1438]] presuming that [[G3543]] the [[G3588]] prisoners [[G1198]] had escaped. [[G1628]] 
28 But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] called out [[G5455]] in a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] “Do [[G4238]] not [[G3367]] harm [[G2556]] yourself! [[G4572]] We are [[G1510]] all [[G537]] here!” [[G1759]] 
29 Calling for [[G154]] lights, [[G5457]] [the jailer] rushed in [[G1530]] and [[G2532]] fell [[G4363]] trembling {before} [[G1790]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas. [[G4609]] 
30 Then [[G2532]] he brought [[G4254]] them [[G846]] out [[G1854]] [and] asked, [[G5346]] “Sirs, [[G2962]] what [[G5101]] must [[G1163]] I [[G1473]] do [[G4160]] to [[G2443]] be saved?” [[G4982]] 
31 They replied, [[G2036]] “Believe [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] you will be saved, [[G4982]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] household.” [[G3624]] 
32 Then [[G2532]] [Paul and Silas] spoke [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] to him [[G846]] [and] to [[G4862]] everyone [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3614]] 
33 At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] hour [[G5610]] of the [[G3588]] night, [[G3571]] [the jailer] took [[G3880]] them [[G846]] [and] washed [[G3068]] [their] [[G3588]] wounds. [[G4127]] And [[G2532]] without delay, [[G3916]] he [[G846]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] household [[G3588]] were baptized. [[G907]] 
34 Then [[G5037]] he brought [[G321]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] [his] [[G3588]] home [[G3624]] and set [[G3908]] [a meal before them]. [[G5132]] [So] [[G2532]] {he} and all [his] household [[G3832]] rejoiced [[G21]] that they had come to believe [[G4100]] in God. [[G2316]] 
35 [When] [[G1161]] daylight [[G2250]] came, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] magistrates [[G4755]] sent [[G649]] [their] [[G3588]] officers [[G4465]] with the order: [[G3004]] “Release [[G630]] those [[G1565]] men.” [[G444]] 
36 The [[G3588]] jailer [[G1200]] informed [[G518]] Paul: [[G3972]] “The [[G3588]] magistrates [[G4755]] have sent orders [[G649]] to [[G2443]] release you. [[G630]] Now [[G3568]] you may go on your way [[G4198]] in [[G1722]] peace.” [[G1515]] 
37 But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] said [[G5346]] to [[G4314]] [the officers], [[G846]] “They beat [[G1194]] us [[G1473]] publicly [[G1219]] without a trial [[G178]] [and] threw [us] [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison, [[G5438]] [even though] we are [[G5225]] Roman citizens. [[G4514]] And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] do they want to send us away [[G1544]] secretly? [[G2977]] Certainly not! [[G3756]] Let them come [[G2064]] themselves [[G846]] and escort us out! [[G1806]] 
38 [So] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] officers [[G4465]] relayed [[G518]] this [[G3778]] message [[G4487]] to the [[G3588]] magistrates, [[G4755]] [who] [[G1161]] were alarmed [[G5399]] to hear [[G191]] that [[G3754]] [Paul and Silas] were [[G1510]] Roman citizens. [[G4514]] 
39 They came [[G2064]] to appease [[G3870]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] led them out, [[G1806]] requesting [[G2065]] that they leave [[G565]] the [[G3588]] city. [[G4172]] 
40 After [Paul and Silas] came [[G1831]] out of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] prison, [[G5438]] they went [[G1525]] to [[G4314]] Lydia’s house [[G3070]] to see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] and encourage [them]. [[G3870]] Then [[G2532]] they left [ the city ]. [[G1831]]
