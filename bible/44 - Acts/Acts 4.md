1 [While Peter and John] [[G846]] were speaking [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] the [[G3588]] priests [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] captain [[G4755]] of the [[G3588]] temple guard [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Sadducees [[G4523]] came [[G2186]] up to them, [[G846]] 
2 greatly disturbed [[G1278]] that [[G1223]] they [[G846]] were teaching [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] proclaiming [[G2605]] in [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] of [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]] 
3 They seized [[G1911]] [Peter and John], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] because [[G1063]] it was [[G1510]] already [[G2235]] evening, [[G2073]] they put [them] [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] custody [[G5084]] until [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] next day. [[G839]] 
4 But [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] who [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] believed, [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of [[G3588]] men [[G435]] grew to [[G1096]] about [[G5613]] five [[G4002]] thousand. [[G5505]] 
5 The [[G3588]] next day [[G839]] [the] [[G846]] rulers, [[G758]] elders, [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] assembled [[G4863]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] 
6 along with [[G2532]] Annas [[G452]] the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] Caiaphas, [[G2533]] John, [[G2491]] Alexander, [[G223]] and [[G2532]] many others [[G3745]] from [[G1537]] the high priest’s [[G748]] family. [[G1085]] 
7 They had [[G2476]] [Peter and John] [[G846]] {brought} in [[G3319]] [and] began to question them: [[G4441]] “By [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] power [[G1411]] or [[G2228]] what [[G4169]] name [[G3686]] {did} you [[G4771]] do [[G4160]] this?” [[G3778]] 
8 Then [[G5119]] Peter, [[G4074]] filled [[G4130]] with [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “Rulers [[G758]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] of the [[G3588]] people! [[G2992]] 
9 If [[G1487]] we [[G1473]] are being examined [[G350]] today [[G4594]] about [[G1909]] a kind service [[G2108]] [to a] man [[G444]] [who was] lame, [[G772]] [to determine] [[G1722]] how [[G5101]] he [[G3778]] was healed, [[G4982]] 
10 [then] let this be [[G1510]] known [[G1110]] to all [[G3956]] of you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] of Israel: [[G2474]] [It is] [[G3754]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth, [[G3480]] whom [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] crucified [[G4717]] [but] whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] [that] [[G1722]] this [man] [[G3778]] stands [[G3936]] before [[G1799]] you [[G4771]] healed. [[G5199]] 
11 [He] [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] ‘the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] you [[G4771]] builders [[G3618]] rejected, [[G1848]] which [[G3588]] has become [[G1096]] [the] cornerstone.’ [[G2776]] 
12 Salvation [[G4991]] exists [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] no one [[G3762]] else, [[G243]] for [[G1063]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3761]] other [[G2087]] name [[G3686]] under [[G5259]] heaven [[G3772]] given [[G1325]] to [[G1722]] men [[G444]] by [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] we [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] be saved.” [[G4982]] 
13 [When] [[G1161]] they saw [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] boldness [[G3954]] of Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] realized [[G2638]] that [[G3754]] they were [[G1510]] unschooled, [[G62]] ordinary [[G2399]] men, [[G444]] they were astonished [[G2296]] and [[G5037]] recognized [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] they had been [[G1510]] with [[G4862]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
14 And [[G5037]] seeing [[G991]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] who [[G3588]] had been healed [[G2323]] standing [there] [[G2476]] with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]] they had [[G2192]] nothing [[G3762]] to say in response. [[G483]] 
15 So [[G1161]] they ordered [[G2753]] them [[G846]] to leave [[G565]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] [and] then conferred [[G4820]] together. [[G240]] 
16 “What [[G5101]] shall we do [[G4160]] with [[G3588]] these [[G3778]] men?” [[G444]] they asked. [[G3004]] “[It] is clear [[G5318]] to everyone [[G3956]] living [[G2730]] [in] Jerusalem [[G2419]] that [[G3754]] a remarkable [[G1110]] miracle [[G4592]] has occurred [[G1096]] through [[G1223]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] we cannot [[G1410]] deny [it]. [[G720]] 
17 But [[G235]] to [[G2443]] keep [this message] from spreading [[G1268]] any further [[G4119]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] we must warn [[G546]] them [[G846]] to speak [[G2980]] no more [[G3371]] to anyone [[G3367]] in [[G1909]] this [[G3778]] name.” [[G3686]] 
18 Then [[G2532]] they called [[G2564]] them in [again] [[G846]] and commanded [them] [[G3853]] not [[G3361]] to speak [[G5350]] [or] [[G3366]] teach [[G1321]] at all [[G2527]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus. [[G2424]] 
19 But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] replied, [[G611]] “Judge for yourselves [[G2919]] whether [[G1487]] it is [[G1510]] right [[G1342]] in God’s sight [[G1799]] to listen [[G191]] to you [[G4771]] rather [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] God. [[G2316]] 
20 For [[G1063]] we [[G1473]] cannot [[G1410]] stop [[G3361]] speaking about [[G2980]] what [[G3739]] we have seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] heard.” [[G191]] 
21 [So] [[G1161]] [the Council members] threatened them further [[G4324]] [and] let them go. [[G630]] They could not find a way [[G2147]] to punish [[G2849]] them, [[G846]] because [[G1223]] {all} the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] were glorifying [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1909]] what [[G3588]] had happened. [[G1096]] 
22 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] who [[G3739]] was miraculously [[G4592]] healed [[G2392]] was [[G1510]] over [[G4119]] forty [[G5062]] years [old]. [[G2094]] 
23 On their release, [[G630]] [Peter and John] returned [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] [their] [[G3588]] own people [[G2398]] and [[G2532]] reported [[G518]] everything that [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] had said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them. [[G846]] 
24 [When] [[G1161]] [the believers] heard this, [[G191]] they lifted up [[G142]] [their] voices [[G5456]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] with one accord. [[G3661]] “Sovereign Lord,” [[G1203]] they said, [[G2036]] “You [[G4771]] made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] everything [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] them. [[G846]] 
25 [You] [[G3588]] spoke [[G2036]] by [[G1223]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] through [the] mouth [[G4750]] of [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] servant, [[G3816]] our [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] David: [[G1138]] ‘Why [[G5101]] {do} the nations [[G1484]] rage, [[G5433]] and [[G2532]] [the] peoples [[G2992]] plot [[G3191]] in vain? [[G2756]] 
26 The [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] take [their] stand [[G3936]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] gather [[G4863]] together [[G1909]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] against [[G2596]] His [[G846]] Anointed One.’ [[G5547]] 
27 In [[G1909]] fact, [[G225]] this [is] [[G3778]] the very [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] [where] [[G1722]] Herod [[G2264]] and [[G2532]] Pontius [[G4194]] Pilate [[G4091]] conspired [[G4863]] with [[G4862]] [the] Gentiles [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] [the] people [[G2992]] of Israel [[G2474]] against [[G1909]] Your [[G4771]] holy [[G40]] servant [[G3816]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] You anointed. [[G5548]] 
28 They carried out [[G4160]] what [[G3745]] Your [[G4771]] hand [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] purpose [[G1012]] had decided beforehand [[G4309]] would happen. [[G1096]] 
29 And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] Lord, [[G2962]] consider [[G1896]] their [[G846]] threats, [[G547]] and [[G2532]] enable [[G1325]] Your [[G4771]] servants [[G1401]] to speak [[G2980]] Your [[G4771]] word [[G3056]] with [[G3326]] complete [[G3956]] boldness, [[G3954]] 
30 as [[G1722]] You [[G4771]] stretch out [[G1614]] Your [[G4771]] hand [[G5495]] to [[G1519]] heal [[G2392]] and [[G2532]] [perform] [[G1096]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Your [[G4771]] holy [[G40]] servant [[G3816]] Jesus.” [[G2424]] 
31 [After] [[G2532]] they [[G846]] had prayed, [[G1189]] [their] [[G1510]] meeting [[G4863]] place [[G5117]] was shaken, [[G4531]] and [[G2532]] they were all filled with [[G4130]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] spoke [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] boldly. [[G3954]] 
32 The [[G3588]] congregation [[G4128]] of [[G3588]] believers [[G4100]] was [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] [in] heart [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] soul. [[G5590]] No [[G3761]] one [[G1520]] claimed that [[G2036]] any [[G5100]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] possessions [[G5225]] was [[G1510]] his own, [[G2398]] but [[G235]] they shared [[G1510]] everything they owned. [[G3956]] 
33 [With] great [[G3173]] power, [[G1411]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] continued to give [[G591]] [their] [[G3588]] testimony [[G3142]] about the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]] And [[G5037]] abundant [[G3173]] grace [[G5485]] was [[G1510]] upon [[G1909]] them [[G846]] all. [[G3956]] 
34 There were [[G1510]] no [[G3761]] needy [[G1729]] ones [[G5100]] among [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] because [[G1063]] those who [[G3745]] owned [[G2935]] lands [[G5564]] or [[G2228]] houses [[G3614]] would sell [ their property ], [[G4453]] bring [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] proceeds [[G5092]] from [[G3588]] [the] sales, [[G4097]] 
35 and [[G2532]] lay [them] [[G5087]] at [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] apostles’ [[G652]] feet [[G4228]] for distribution [[G1239]] [to] [[G1538]] anyone [[G5100]] as [[G2530]] he had [[G2192]] need. [[G5532]] 
36 Joseph, [[G2501]] a Levite [[G3019]] from Cyprus, [[G2953]] whom [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] called [[G1941]] Barnabas [[G921]] ( [[G3739]] meaning [[G3177]] Son [[G5207]] of Encouragement), [[G3874]] 
37 sold [[G4453]] a field [[G68]] he [[G846]] owned, [[G5225]] brought [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] money, [[G5536]] and [[G2532]] laid [it] [[G5087]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] apostles’ [[G652]] feet. [[G4228]]
