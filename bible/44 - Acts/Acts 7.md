1 Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] asked [Stephen], [[G2036]] “Are [[G2192]] these [charges] [[G3778]] true?” [[G3779]] 
2 And [[G1161]] [Stephen] declared: [[G5346]] “Brothers [[G80]] and [[G2532]] fathers, [[G3962]] listen [to me]! [[G191]] The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of glory [[G1391]] appeared [[G3708]] to [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] Abraham [[G11]] while he was [still] [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Mesopotamia, [[G3318]] before [[G4250]] he [[G846]] lived [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] Haran, [[G5488]] 
3 and [[G2532]] told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] ‘Leave [[G1831]] your [[G4771]] country [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] kindred [[G4772]] and [[G2532]] go [[G1204]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] I will show [[G1166]] you.’ [[G4771]] 
4 [So] [[G5119]] [Abraham] left [[G1831]] [the] land [[G1093]] of the Chaldeans [[G5466]] [and] settled [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] Haran. [[G5488]] After [[G3326]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] died, [[G599]] [God] brought [[G3351]] him [[G846]] out of that place, [[G2547]] into [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] land [[G1093]] where [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] {are} now [[G3568]] living. [[G2730]] 
5 He gave [[G1325]] him [[G846]] no [[G3756]] inheritance [[G2817]] [here], [[G846]] not even [[G3761]] a foot of ground. [[G968]] [But] [[G2532]] [God] promised [[G1861]] to give [[G1325]] possession [[G2697]] of [the land] [[G846]] to [Abraham] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] descendants, [[G4690]] [even though] he did not yet have [[G1510]] a child. [[G5043]] 
6 God [[G2316]] told [him] [[G2980]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] descendants [[G4690]] would be [[G1510]] foreigners [[G3941]] in [[G1722]] a strange [[G245]] land, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] they would be enslaved [[G1402]] and [[G2532]] mistreated [[G2559]] four hundred [[G5071]] years. [[G2094]] 
7 ‘[But] [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] will punish [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] nation [[G1484]] [that] [[G3739]] enslaves them,’ [[G1398]] God [[G2316]] said, [[G2036]] ‘and [[G2532]] afterward [[G3326]] they will come forth [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] worship [[G3000]] Me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] place.’ [[G5117]] 
8 Then [[G2532]] [God] gave [[G1325]] [Abraham] [[G846]] [the] covenant [[G1242]] of circumcision, [[G4061]] and [[G2532]] [Abraham] became the father of [[G1080]] Isaac [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] circumcised [[G4059]] him [[G846]] on the [[G3588]] eighth [[G3590]] day. [[G2250]] And [[G2532]] Isaac [became the father of] [[G2464]] Jacob, [[G2384]] and [[G2532]] Jacob [[G2384]] of the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] patriarchs. [[G3966]] 
9 [Because] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] patriarchs [[G3966]] were jealous [[G2206]] of Joseph, [[G2501]] they sold him as a slave [[G591]] into [[G1519]] Egypt. [[G125]] But [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] 
10 and [[G2532]] rescued [[G1807]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] troubles. [[G2347]] [He] granted [[G1325]] [Joseph] [[G846]] favor [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] wisdom [[G4678]] in the sight of [[G1726]] Pharaoh [[G5328]] king [[G935]] of Egypt, [[G125]] [who] [[G2532]] appointed [[G2525]] him [[G846]] ruler [[G2233]] over [[G1909]] Egypt [[G125]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3650]] his [[G846]] household. [[G3624]] 
11 Then [[G1161]] famine [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] suffering [[G2347]] swept [[G2064]] across [[G3650]] Egypt [[G125]] and [[G2532]] Canaan, [[G5477]] and [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] could not find [[G2147]] food. [[G5527]] 
12 [When] [[G1161]] Jacob [[G2384]] heard that [[G191]] [there] was [[G1510]] grain [[G4621]] in [[G1519]] Egypt, [[G125]] he sent [[G1821]] our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] [on their] first [visit]. [[G4412]] 
13 On [[G1722]] [their] [[G3588]] second [visit], [[G1208]] Joseph [[G2501]] revealed his identity [[G319]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] brothers, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] [his] [[G2501]] family [[G1085]] became [[G1096]] known [[G5318]] to Pharaoh. [[G5328]] 
14 Then [[G1161]] Joseph [[G2501]] sent for [[G649]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Jacob [[G2384]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] [his] [[G3588]] relatives, [[G4772]] seventy-five [[G1440]] in all. [[G1722]] 
15 [So] [[G2532]] Jacob [[G2384]] went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Egypt, [[G125]] [where] [[G2532]] he [[G846]] and [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] died. [[G5053]] 
16 [Their bones] [[G2532]] were carried back [[G3346]] to [[G1519]] Shechem [[G4966]] and [[G2532]] placed [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3418]] that [[G3739]] Abraham [[G11]] had bought [[G5608]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of Hamor [[G1697]] at [[G1722]] Shechem [[G4966]] for a price he paid [[G5092]] in silver. [[G694]] 
17 As [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] drew near [[G1448]] for [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] [to fulfill] His promise [[G1860]] to Abraham, [[G11]] [our] [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] in [[G1722]] Egypt [[G125]] increased [[G837]] greatly in number. [[G4129]] 
18 Then [[G891]] another [[G2087]] king, [[G935]] who [[G3739]] knew [[G1492]] nothing [[G3756]] of Joseph, [[G2501]] arose [[G450]] over [[G1909]] Egypt. [[G125]] 
19 He [[G3778]] exploited [[G2686]] our [[G1473]] people [[G1085]] [and] oppressed [[G2559]] our [[G1473]] fathers, [[G3962]] forcing [them] [[G4160]] to abandon [[G1570]] their [[G846]] infants [[G1025]] so [[G1519]] they would die. [[G2225]] 
20 At [[G1722]] that [[G3739]] time [[G2540]] Moses [[G3475]] was born, [[G1080]] and [[G2532]] he was [[G1510]] beautiful [[G791]] in the sight of God. [[G2316]] [For] three [[G5140]] months [[G3376]] [he] [[G3739]] was nurtured [[G397]] in [[G1722]] [his] [[G3588]] father’s [[G3962]] house. [[G3624]] 
21 [When] [[G1161]] he [[G846]] was set outside, [[G1620]] Pharaoh’s [[G5328]] daughter [[G2364]] took him [[G337]] and [[G2532]] brought him up [[G397]] as [[G1519]] her own [[G1438]] son. [[G5207]] 
22 So [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] was educated [[G3811]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] [the] wisdom [[G4678]] of [the] Egyptians [[G124]] and [[G1161]] was [[G1510]] powerful [[G1415]] in [[G1722]] speech [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] action. [[G2041]] 
23 When [[G5613]] [Moses] [[G846]] [was] [[G5550]] forty years [[G5063]] [old], [[G4137]] he decided [[G305]] to visit [[G1980]] his [[G846]] brothers, [[G80]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of Israel. [[G2474]] 
24 And [[G2532]] when he saw [[G3708]] one [of them] [[G5100]] being wronged, [[G91]] [Moses] went to his defense [[G292]] and [[G2532]] avenged [him] [[G1557]] by striking down [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] Egyptian [[G124]] who was oppressing [him]. [[G2669]] 
25 He assumed [[G3543]] his [[G846]] brothers [[G80]] would understand [[G4920]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] was using him [[G5495]] to deliver them, [[G4991]] but [[G1161]] [they did not]. [[G4920]] 
26 The [[G3588]] next [[G1966]] day [[G2250]] he came upon [[G3708]] [two Israelites who] [[G846]] were fighting, [[G3164]] and he tried to reconcile them, [[G4900]] saying, [[G2036]] ‘Men, [[G435]] you are [[G1510]] brothers. [[G80]] Why [[G5101]] are you mistreating [[G91]] one another?’ [[G240]] 
27 But [[G1161]] the [man who] [[G3588]] was abusing [[G91]] [his] [[G3588]] neighbor [[G4139]] pushed [Moses] aside [[G683]] [and] said, [[G2036]] ‘Who [[G5101]] made [[G2525]] you [[G4771]] ruler [[G758]] and [[G2532]] judge [[G1348]] over [[G1909]] us? [[G1473]] 
28 {Do} you [[G4771]] want [[G2309]] to kill me [[G337]] as [[G3739]] you killed [[G337]] the [[G3588]] Egyptian [[G124]] yesterday?’ [[G5504]] 
29 At [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] remark, [[G3056]] Moses [[G3475]] fled [[G5343]] to [[G1722]] [the] land [[G1093]] of Midian, [[G3099]] where [[G3757]] he lived as [[G1096]] a foreigner [[G3941]] [and] had [[G1080]] two [[G1417]] sons. [[G5207]] 
30 [After] [[G2532]] forty [[G5062]] years [[G2094]] had passed, [[G4137]] an angel [[G32]] appeared [[G3708]] to [Moses] [[G846]] in [[G1722]] [the] flames [[G5395]] of a burning [[G4442]] bush [[G942]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] desert [[G2048]] near [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] Sinai. [[G4614]] 
31 [When] [[G1161]] Moses [[G3475]] saw [it], [[G3708]] he marveled at [[G2296]] the [[G3588]] sight. [[G3705]] [As] he [[G846]] approached [[G4334]] to look [more closely], [[G2657]] [the] voice [[G5456]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] came [to him]: [[G1096]] 
32 ‘I [am] [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of your [[G4771]] fathers, [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] Jacob.’ [[G2384]] Moses [[G3475]] trembled with fear [[G1790]] [and] did not dare [[G5111]] to look. [[G2657]] 
33 Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] ‘Take off [[G3089]] [your] [[G3588]] sandals, [[G5266]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3739]] you are standing [[G2476]] is [[G1510]] holy [[G40]] ground. [[G1093]] 
34 I have indeed seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] oppression [[G2561]] of [[G3588]] My [[G1473]] people [[G2992]] in [[G1722]] Egypt. [[G125]] I have heard [[G191]] their [[G846]] groaning [[G4726]] and [[G2532]] have come down [[G2597]] to deliver [[G1807]] them. [[G846]] Now [[G3568]] come, [[G1204]] I will send [[G649]] you [[G4771]] back to [[G1519]] Egypt. [[G125]] 
35 This [[G3778]] Moses, [[G3475]] whom [[G3739]] they had rejected [[G720]] with the words, [[G2036]] ‘Who [[G5101]] made [[G2525]] you [[G4771]] ruler [[G758]] and [[G2532]] judge?’ [[G1348]] [is] the one [[G3778]] God [[G2316]] sent [[G649]] to be [their] ruler [[G758]] and [[G2532]] redeemer, [[G3086]] through [[G4862]] [the] angel [[G32]] who [[G3588]] appeared [[G3708]] to him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] bush. [[G942]] 
36 [He] [[G3778]] led them out [[G1806]] [and] performed [[G4160]] wonders [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] signs [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] [the] land [[G1093]] of Egypt, [[G125]] at [[G1722]] [the] Red [[G2063]] Sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] [for] forty [[G5062]] years [[G2094]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]] 
37 This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [same] [[G3588]] Moses [[G3475]] who [[G3588]] told [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Israelites, [[G2474]] ‘God [[G2316]] will raise up [[G450]] for you [[G4771]] a prophet [[G4396]] like [[G5613]] me [[G1473]] from among [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] [own] [[G3588]] brothers.’ [[G80]] 
38 [He] [[G3778]] was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] assembly [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] who [[G3588]] spoke [[G2980]] to him [[G846]] on [[G1722]] Mount [[G3735]] Sinai, [[G4614]] and [[G2532]] [with] [[G3739]] our [[G1473]] fathers. [[G3962]] [And] he received [[G1209]] living [[G2198]] words [[G3051]] to pass on [[G1325]] to us. [[G1473]] 
39 [But] our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] refused [[G2309]] to [[G1096]] obey [[G5255]] [him]. [[G3739]] Instead, [[G235]] they rejected [him] [[G683]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] turned back [[G4762]] to [[G1519]] Egypt. [[G125]] 
40 They said [[G2036]] to Aaron, [[G2]] ‘Make [[G4160]] us [[G1473]] gods [[G2316]] who [[G3739]] will go before [[G4313]] us! [[G1473]] As for [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] Moses [[G3475]] who [[G3739]] led us [[G1806]] out of [[G1537]] Egypt, [[G125]] we do not know [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] has happened [[G1096]] to him.’ [[G846]] 
41 At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2250]] they made a calf [[G3447]] and [[G2532]] offered [[G321]] a sacrifice [[G2378]] to the [[G3588]] idol, [[G1497]] rejoicing [[G2165]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] hands. [[G5495]] 
42 But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] turned away [from them] [[G4762]] and [[G2532]] gave them over [[G3860]] to the worship [[G3000]] of the [[G3588]] heavenly bodies, [[G3772]] as [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] [the] book [[G976]] of the [[G3588]] prophets: [[G4396]] ‘Did you offer [[G4374]] Me [[G1473]] slain beasts [[G4968]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices [[G2378]] forty [[G5062]] years [[G2094]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] O house [[G3624]] of Israel? [[G2474]] 
43 You took along [[G353]] the [[G3588]] tent [[G4633]] of Moloch [[G3434]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] star [[G798]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] god [[G2316]] Rephan, [[G4481]] the [[G3588]] idols [[G5179]] you made [[G4160]] to worship. [[G4352]] [Therefore] [[G2532]] I will carry you away [[G3351]] beyond [[G1900]] Babylon.’ [[G897]] 
44 Our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] [had] [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle [[G4633]] of the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3142]] with [them] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]] [It was] constructed [[G4160]] exactly as [[G2531]] [God] [[G3588]] had directed [[G1299]] Moses, [[G3475]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] pattern [[G5179]] he had seen. [[G3708]] 
45 And [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] who [[G3739]] received it [[G1237]] brought [it in] [[G1521]] with [[G3326]] Joshua [[G2424]] [when] [[G1722]] they dispossessed [[G2697]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] God [[G2316]] drove out [[G1856]] before [[G575]] [them]. [[G3962]] [It remained] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2250]] of David, [[G1138]] 
46 who [[G3739]] found [[G2147]] favor [[G5485]] in the sight [[G1799]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] asked [[G154]] to provide [[G2147]] a dwelling place [[G4638]] for the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Jacob. [[G2384]] 
47 But [it was] [[G1161]] Solomon [[G4672]] [who] built [[G3618]] [the] house [[G3624]] for Him. [[G846]] 
48 However, [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Most High [[G5310]] {does} not [[G3756]] live [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] [houses] made by human hands. [[G5499]] As [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] says: [[G3004]] 
49 ‘Heaven [is] [[G3772]] My [[G1473]] throne [[G2362]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] [is] My [[G4228]] footstool. [[G5286]] What kind of [[G4169]] house [[G3624]] will you build [[G3618]] for Me, [[G1473]] says [[G3004]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] or [[G2228]] where [will] [[G5101]] My [[G1473]] place [[G5117]] of repose [be]? [[G2663]] 
50 {Has} not [[G3780]] My [[G1473]] hand [[G5495]] made [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] these things?’ [[G3778]] 
51 [You] stiff-necked [people] [[G4644]] [with] [[G2532]] uncircumcised [[G564]] hearts [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] ears! [[G3775]] You [[G4771]] always [[G104]] resist [[G496]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] just [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] your [[G4771]] fathers [did]. [[G3962]] 
52 Which [[G5101]] of the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] {did} your [[G4771]] fathers [[G3962]] fail [[G3756]] to persecute? [[G1377]] They even killed [[G615]] those who [[G3588]] foretold [[G4293]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G1660]] of the [[G3588]] Righteous One. [[G1342]] And now [[G3568]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1096]] [His] [[G3739]] betrayers [[G4273]] and [[G2532]] murderers [[G5406]] 
53 [you] who [[G3748]] have received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] ordained [[G1296]] by [[G1519]] angels, [[G32]] yet [[G2532]] have not kept [it].” [[G5442]] 
54 On hearing [[G191]] this, [[G3778]] [the members of the Sanhedrin] were enraged, [[G1282]] and [[G2532]] they gnashed [[G1031]] [their] [[G3588]] teeth [[G3599]] at [[G1909]] him. [[G846]] 
55 But [[G1161]] [Stephen], [[G5225]] full [[G4134]] of [the] Holy Spirit, [[G4151]] looked intently [[G816]] into [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] [and] saw [[G3708]] [the] glory [[G1391]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] standing [[G2476]] at [[G1537]] the right hand [[G1188]] of God. [[G2316]] 
56 “Look,” [[G2400]] he said, [[G2036]] “I see [[G2334]] heaven [[G3772]] open [[G1272]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] standing [[G2476]] at [[G1537]] the right [hand] [[G1188]] of God.” [[G2316]] 
57 At this [[G1161]] they covered [[G4912]] their [[G846]] ears, [[G3775]] cried out [[G2896]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] rushed [[G3729]] together [[G3661]] at [[G1909]] him. [[G846]] 
58 They dragged [him] [[G1544]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] [and] began to stone [him]. [[G3036]] Meanwhile, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] witnesses [[G3144]] laid [[G659]] their [[G846]] garments [[G2440]] at [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] of a young man [[G3494]] named [[G2564]] Saul. [[G4569]] 
59 [While] [[G2532]] they were stoning [him], [[G3036]] Stephen [[G4736]] appealed, [[G1941]] “Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] receive [[G1209]] my [[G1473]] spirit.” [[G4151]] 
60 Falling [[G5087]] on [his] [[G3588]] knees, [[G1119]] he cried out [[G2896]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] “Lord, [[G2962]] {do} not [[G3361]] hold [[G2476]] this [[G3778]] sin [[G266]] against them.” [[G846]] And [[G2532]] when he had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] he fell asleep. [[G2837]]
