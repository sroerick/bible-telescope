# Acts 20
[[Acts 19|←]] • [[Acts 21|→]]
1 When [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] uproar [[G2351]] had ended, [[G3973]] Paul [[G3972]] sent for [[G3343]] the [[G3588]] disciples. [[G3101]] After he had encouraged [them], [[G3870]] he said goodbye [to them] [[G782]] [and] left [[G1831]] for [[G4198]] Macedonia. [[G3109]] 
2 [After] [[G1161]] traveling through [[G1330]] that [[G1565]] area [[G3313]] and [[G2532]] speaking many words of encouragement, [[G3870]] he arrived [[G2064]] in [[G1519]] Greece, [[G1671]] 
3 [where] [[G5037]] he stayed [[G4160]] three [[G5140]] months. [[G3376]] [And when] [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] formed [[G1096]] a plot [[G1917]] against him [[G846]] [as] he was about [[G3195]] to sail [[G321]] for [[G1519]] Syria, [[G4947]] he decided [[G1106]] to go back [[G5290]] through [[G1223]] Macedonia. [[G3109]] 
4 [Paul] [[G846]] was accompanied by [[G4902]] Sopater [[G4986]] [son of] Pyrrhus [[G4450]] from Berea, [[G961]] Aristarchus [[G708]] and [[G2532]] Secundus [[G4580]] from Thessalonica, [[G2331]] Gaius [[G1050]] from Derbe, [[G1190]] Timothy, [[G5095]] and [[G1161]] Tychicus [[G5190]] and [[G2532]] Trophimus [[G5161]] from Asia. [[G774]] 
5 These [men] [[G3778]] went on ahead [[G4281]] [and] waited for [[G3306]] us [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] Troas. [[G5174]] 
6 And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] [Feast] [[G2250]] of [[G3588]] Unleavened Bread, [[G106]] we [[G1473]] sailed [[G1602]] from [[G575]] Philippi, [[G5375]] and [[G2532]] five [[G4002]] days [[G2250]] later [[G891]] we rejoined [[G2064]] them [[G846]] in [[G1519]] Troas, [[G5174]] where [[G3699]] we stayed [[G1304]] seven [[G2033]] days. [[G2250]] 
7 On [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] first [day] [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] week [[G4521]] we [[G1473]] came together [[G4863]] to break [[G2806]] bread. [[G740]] [Since] Paul [[G3972]] was ready [[G3195]] to leave [[G1826]] the [[G3588]] next day, [[G1887]] he talked [[G1256]] to them [[G846]] and [[G5037]] kept on [[G3905]] speaking [[G3056]] until [[G3360]] midnight. [[G3317]] 
8 Now [[G1161]] there were [[G1510]] many [[G2425]] lamps [[G2985]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] upper room [[G5253]] where [[G3757]] we were [[G1510]] gathered. [[G4863]] 
9 And [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] young man [[G3494]] named [[G3686]] Eutychus, [[G2161]] seated [[G2516]] by [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] window, [[G2376]] was sinking into [[G2702]] a deep [[G901]] sleep [[G5258]] as Paul [[G3972]] talked [[G1256]] on [[G1909]] and on. [[G4119]] When he was sound [[G2702]] asleep, [[G5258]] he fell [[G4098]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] third story [[G5152]] and [[G2532]] was picked up [[G142]] dead. [[G3498]] 
10 But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] went down, [[G2597]] threw [himself] on [[G1968]] [the young man], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] embraced [him]. [[G4843]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be alarmed!” [[G2350]] he said. [[G2036]] “He [[G846]] is [[G1510]] still alive!” [[G5590]] 
11 Then [[G1161]] [Paul] went back upstairs, [[G305]] broke [[G2806]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] ate. [[G1089]] [After] [[G5037]] speaking [[G3656]] until [[G891]] daybreak, [[G827]] he departed. [[G1831]] 
12 And [[G1161]] [the people] {were} greatly [[G3357]] relieved [[G3870]] to take [[G71]] the [[G3588]] boy [[G3816]] [home] alive. [[G2198]] 
13 We [[G1473]] went on ahead [[G4281]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] [and] sailed [[G321]] to [[G1909]] Assos, [[G789]] [where] [[G1564]] we were to [[G3195]] take [[G353]] Paul {aboard}. [[G3972]] He had arranged [[G1299]] this [[G3779]] because he was going there [[G1510]] on foot. [[G3978]] 
14 And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] he met [[G4820]] us [[G1473]] at [[G1519]] Assos, [[G789]] we took him aboard [[G353]] [and] went on [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Mitylene. [[G3412]] 
15 Sailing on [[G636]] from there, [[G2547]] we arrived [[G2658]] the [[G3588]] next [day] [[G1966]] opposite [[G481]] Chios. [[G5508]] The [[G3588]] [day] after that [[G2087]] we arrived [[G3846]] at [[G1519]] Samos, [[G4544]] and [[G1161]] on the [[G3588]] following [day] [[G2192]] we came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Miletus. [[G3399]] 
16 Paul [[G3972]] had decided [[G2919]] to sail past [[G3896]] Ephesus [[G2181]] to [[G3704]] avoid [[G1096]] spending time [[G5551]] in [[G1722]] [the province of] Asia, [[G773]] because [[G1063]] he was in a hurry [[G4692]] to reach [[G1096]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] if [[G1487]] possible, [[G1415]] by the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of Pentecost. [[G4005]] 
17 From [[G575]] Miletus, [[G3399]] [Paul] sent [[G3992]] to [[G1519]] Ephesus [[G2181]] [for] [[G3333]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] of the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]] 
18 When [[G5613]] they came [[G3854]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] he said, [[G2036]] “You [[G4771]] know [[G1987]] how [[G4459]] I lived [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] time [[G5550]] [I was] with [[G3326]] you, [[G4771]] from [[G575]] the first [[G4413]] day [[G2250]] I arrived [[G1910]] in [[G1519]] [the province of] Asia. [[G773]] 
19 I served [[G1398]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] great [[G3956]] humility [[G5012]] and [[G2532]] [with] tears, [[G1144]] and [[G2532]] in the trials [[G3986]] I faced [[G4819]] through [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] plots [[G1917]] of the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]] 
20 I did not shrink back [[G5288]] from declaring [[G312]] [anything] [[G3762]] that [[G3588]] was helpful [[G4851]] to you [[G4771]] [as] [[G2532]] I taught [[G1321]] you [[G4771]] publicly [[G1219]] and [[G2532]] from [[G2596]] house to house, [[G3624]] 
21 testifying [[G1263]] to Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks [[G1672]] alike [[G5037]] {about} repentance [[G3341]] to [[G1519]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1519]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
22 And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] compelled [[G1210]] by the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] I [[G1473]] am going [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] not [[G3361]] knowing [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] will happen [[G4876]] to me [[G1473]] [there]. [[G846]] 
23 [I] only [know] [[G4133]] that [[G3754]] in town after town [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] warns [[G1263]] me [[G1473]] that [[G3754]] chains [[G1199]] and [[G2532]] afflictions [[G2347]] await [[G3306]] me. [[G1473]] 
24 But [[G235]] I consider [[G4160]] my [[G3588]] life [[G5590]] of no [[G3762]] value [[G5093]] to myself, [[G1683]] if only [[G5613]] I may finish [[G5048]] my [[G1473]] course [[G1408]] and [ complete ] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ministry [[G1248]] I have received [[G2983]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus— [[G2424]] [ the ministry ] of testifying [[G1263]] to the [[G3588]] good news [[G2098]] of [[G3588]] Gods [[G2316]] grace. [[G5485]] 
25 Now [[G3568]] I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [none of] [[G3956]] you [[G4771]] among [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] I have preached [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] will see [[G3708]] my [[G1473]] face [[G4383]] [again]. [[G3765]] 
26 Therefore [[G1360]] I testify [[G3143]] to you [[G4771]] this [[G4594]] day [[G2250]] that [[G3754]] I [am] [[G1510]] innocent [[G2513]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of all [men]. [[G3956]] 
27 For [[G1063]] I did not shrink back [[G5288]] from declaring [[G312]] to you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] will [[G1012]] of God. [[G2316]] 
28 Keep watch over [[G4337]] yourselves [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] entire [[G3956]] flock [[G4168]] of [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] has made [[G5087]] you [[G4771]] overseers. [[G1985]] Be shepherds [[G4165]] of the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of God, [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] He purchased [[G4046]] with [[G1223]] [His] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] blood. [[G129]] 
29 I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] after [[G3326]] my [[G1473]] departure, [[G867]] savage [[G926]] wolves [[G3074]] will come in [[G1525]] among [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] and will not spare [[G5339]] the [[G3588]] flock. [[G4168]] 
30 Even [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] your own [[G4771]] number, [[G846]] men [[G435]] will rise up [[G450]] [and] distort [[G1294]] [the truth] [[G2980]] to draw away [[G645]] disciples [[G3101]] after [[G3694]] them. [[G1438]] 
31 Therefore [[G1352]] be alert [[G1127]] [and] remember [[G3421]] that [[G3754]] for three years [[G5148]] I never stopped [[G3973]] warning [[G3560]] each [[G1538]] [of you] [[G1520]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] with [[G3326]] tears. [[G1144]] 
32 And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I commit [[G3908]] you [[G4771]] to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] grace, [[G5485]] which [[G3588]] can [[G1410]] build [you] up [[G3618]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] you [[G3588]] an inheritance [[G2817]] among [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] are sanctified. [[G37]] 
33 I have not coveted [[G1937]] anyone’s [[G3762]] silver [[G694]] or [[G2228]] gold [[G5553]] or [[G2228]] clothing. [[G2441]] 
34 You yourselves [[G846]] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] hands [of mine] [[G5495]] have ministered to [[G5256]] my [[G1473]] [own] [[G3588]] needs [[G5532]] and [those of] [[G2532]] my companions. [[G3588]] 
35 In everything, [[G3956]] I showed [[G5263]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] by this kind [[G3779]] of hard work [[G2872]] we must [[G1163]] help [[G482]] the [[G3588]] weak, [[G770]] remembering [[G3421]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Himself: [[G846]] ‘It is [[G1510]] more [[G3123]] blessed [[G3107]] to give [[G1325]] than [[G2228]] to receive. [[G2983]] 
36 [When] [[G2532]] [Paul] had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] he knelt down [[G5087]] with [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] of them [[G846]] [and] prayed. [[G4336]] 
37 They all [[G3956]] wept [[G2805]] openly [[G2425]] [as] [[G2532]] they embraced [[G1968]] Paul [[G3972]] [and] kissed [[G2705]] him. [[G846]] 
38 They were especially grieved [[G3600]] by [[G1909]] his statement [[G2046]] that [[G3754]] they would [never] [[G3195]] see [[G2334]] his [[G846]] face [[G4383]] [again]. [[G3765]] Then [[G1161]] they accompanied [[G4311]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]]
