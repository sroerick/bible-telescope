1 After [[G3326]] this, [[G3778]] [Paul] left [[G5563]] Athens [[G116]] [and] went [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Corinth. [[G2882]] 
2 [There] [[G2532]] he found [[G2147]] a [[G5100]] Jew [[G2453]] named [[G3686]] Aquila, [[G207]] a native [[G1085]] of Pontus, [[G4193]] who {had} recently [[G4373]] come [[G2064]] from [[G575]] Italy [[G2482]] with [[G2532]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] Priscilla, [[G4252]] because [[G1223]] Claudius [[G2804]] had ordered [[G1299]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] to leave [[G5563]] Rome. [[G4516]] [Paul] went [[G4334]] to [ visit ] them, [[G846]] 
3 and [[G2532]] he stayed [[G3306]] and [[G2532]] worked [[G2038]] with [[G3844]] them [[G846]] because [[G1223]] they were [[G1510]] tentmakers [[G4635]] by trade, [[G5078]] [just as] [[G3673]] he was. [[G1510]] 
4 Every [[G3956]] Sabbath [[G4521]] he reasoned [[G1256]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] trying to persuade [[G3982]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks [[G1672]] alike. [[G5037]] 
5 And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] Silas [[G4609]] and [[G2532]] Timothy [[G5095]] came down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] Paul [[G3972]] devoted himself fully [[G4912]] to the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] testifying [[G1263]] to the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] [that] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
6 But [when] [[G1161]] they [[G846]] opposed [[G498]] and [[G2532]] insulted [him], [[G987]] he shook out [[G1621]] [his] [[G3588]] garments [[G2440]] [and] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Your [[G4771]] blood [[G129]] [be] on [[G1909]] your [[G4771]] [own] [[G3588]] heads! [[G2776]] I [am] [[G1473]] innocent [of it]. [[G2513]] From [[G575]] now on [[G3568]] I will go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]] 
7 [So] [[G2532]] [Paul] left [[G3327]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] [and] went [[G1525]] next door [[G4927]] to [[G1519]] [the] house [[G3614]] of [[G5100]] Titius [[G5103]] Justus, [[G2459]] a worshiper [[G4576]] of God. [[G2316]] 
8 Crispus, [[G2921]] the [[G3588]] synagogue leader, [[G752]] and [[G4862]] his [[G846]] whole [[G3650]] household [[G3624]] believed [[G4100]] in the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] of the [[G3588]] Corinthians [[G2881]] who heard [ the message ] [[G191]] believed [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] were baptized. [[G907]] 
9 One [[G1161]] night [[G3571]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] spoke [[G2036]] to Paul [[G3972]] in [[G1223]] a vision: [[G3705]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid; [[G5399]] keep on speaking; [[G2980]] {do} not [[G3361]] be silent. [[G4623]] 
10 For [[G1360]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] will lay a hand on [[G2007]] you, [[G4771]] because [[G1360]] I have [[G1510]] many [[G4183]] people [[G2992]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] city.” [[G4172]] 
11 [So] [[G1161]] [Paul] stayed [[G2523]] for a year [[G1763]] and [[G2532]] [a half], [[G1803]] teaching [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] among [[G1722]] [the Corinthians]. [[G846]] 
12 [While] [[G1161]] Gallio [[G1058]] was [[G1510]] proconsul [[G446]] of [[G3588]] Achaia, [[G882]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] coordinated an [[G3661]] attack [[G2721]] on Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat. [[G968]] 
13 “This [man] [[G3778]] is persuading [[G374]] the [[G3588]] [people] [[G444]] to worship [[G4576]] God [[G2316]] in ways contrary to [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Law,” [[G3551]] they said. [[G3004]] 
14 But [just as] [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] was about [[G3195]] to speak, [[G455]] Gallio [[G1058]] told [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] “If [[G1487]] this matter involved [[G1510]] a [[G5100]] wrongdoing [[G92]] or [[G2228]] vicious [[G4190]] crime, [[G4467]] O [[G5599]] Jews, [[G2453]] it would be reasonable [[G3056]] for me to hear [[G430]] your [ complaint ]. [[G4771]] 
15 But [[G1161]] since [[G1487]] it is [[G1510]] a dispute [[G2213]] about [[G4012]] words [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] names [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] your own [[G4771]] law, [[G3551]] settle [it] [[G3708]] yourselves. [[G846]] I [[G1473]] refuse [[G1014]] to be [[G1510]] a judge [[G2923]] of such things.” [[G3778]] 
16 And [[G2532]] he drove [[G556]] them {away} [[G846]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat. [[G968]] 
17 At this, [[G1161]] the crowd seized [[G1949]] Sosthenes [[G4988]] the [[G3588]] synagogue leader [[G752]] [and] beat [him] [[G5180]] in front of [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat. [[G968]] [But] [[G2532]] none [[G3762]] of this [[G3778]] was of any concern [[G3199]] to Gallio. [[G1058]] 
18 Paul [[G3972]] remained [in Corinth] [[G4357]] for quite [[G2425]] some [[G2089]] time [[G2250]] [before] saying goodbye [[G657]] to the [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]] {He had} [his] [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] shaved [[G2751]] in [[G1722]] Cenchrea [[G2747]] to keep [[G1063]] a vow [[G2171]] he had [ made ], [[G2192]] [and then] he sailed [[G1602]] for [[G1519]] Syria, [[G4947]] accompanied by [[G4862]] Priscilla [[G4252]] and [[G2532]] Aquila. [[G207]] 
19 [When] [[G1161]] they reached [[G2658]] Ephesus, [[G2181]] [Paul] parted ways with [[G2641]] [Priscilla and Aquila]. [[G2548]] He himself [[G846]] went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [there] [[G4864]] [and] reasoned [[G1256]] with the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]] 
20 [When] [[G1161]] they [[G846]] asked [him] [[G2065]] to stay [[G3306]] for [[G1909]] a while longer, [[G4119]] he declined. [[G1962]] 
21 But [[G235]] as he left, [[G657]] he said, [[G2036]] “I will come back [[G344]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] again [[G3825]] [if] God [[G2316]] is willing.” [[G2309]] [And] he set sail [[G321]] from [[G575]] Ephesus. [[G2181]] 
22 [When Paul] [[G2532]] had landed [[G2718]] at [[G1519]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] he went up [[G305]] and [[G2532]] greeted [[G782]] the [[G3588]] church [ at Jerusalem ]. [[G1577]] [Then] he went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Antioch. [[G490]] 
23 [After] [[G2532]] [Paul] had spent [[G4160]] some [[G5100]] time [in Antioch], [[G5550]] he traveled [[G1831]] from place to place [[G2517]] throughout [[G1330]] the [[G3588]] region [[G5561]] of Galatia [[G1054]] and [[G2532]] Phrygia, [[G5435]] strengthening [[G1991]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] disciples. [[G3101]] 
24 Meanwhile [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] Jew [[G2453]] named [[G3686]] Apollos, [[G625]] a native [[G1085]] of Alexandria, [[G221]] came [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Ephesus. [[G2181]] He was [[G1510]] an eloquent [[G3052]] man, [[G435]] well versed [[G1415]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures. [[G1124]] 
25 He [[G3778]] had been [[G1510]] instructed in [[G2727]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] was fervent [[G2204]] in spirit. [[G4151]] He spoke [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] taught [[G1321]] accurately [[G199]] about [[G4012]] Jesus, [[G2424]] [though] he knew [[G1987]] only [[G3440]] the [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] of John. [[G2491]] 
26 And [[G5037]] he [[G3778]] began [[G756]] to speak boldly [[G3955]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue. [[G4864]] [When] [[G1161]] Priscilla [[G4252]] and [[G2532]] Aquila [[G207]] heard [[G191]] him, [[G846]] they took him in [[G4355]] and [[G2532]] explained [[G1620]] to him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] more accurately. [[G199]] 
27 [When] [[G1161]] [Apollos] [[G846]] resolved [[G1014]] to cross over [[G1330]] to [[G1519]] Achaia, [[G882]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] encouraged [him] [[G4389]] [and] wrote [[G1125]] to the [[G3588]] disciples [there] [[G3101]] to welcome [[G588]] him. [[G846]] On his arrival, [[G3854]] he greatly [[G4183]] aided [[G4820]] those who [[G3588]] by [[G1223]] grace [[G5485]] had believed. [[G4100]] 
28 For [[G1063]] he powerfully [[G2159]] refuted [[G1246]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] in public [debate], [[G1219]] proving [[G1925]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures [[G1124]] [that] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]]
