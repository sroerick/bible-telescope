[[Acts 22|←]] • [[Acts 24|→]]
1 Paul [[G3972]] looked directly [[G816]] at the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Brothers, [[G80]] I [[G1473]] have conducted myself [[G4176]] before God [[G2316]] in all [[G3956]] good [[G18]] conscience [[G4893]] to [[G891]] this [[G3778]] day.” [[G2250]] 
2 At this, [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] Ananias [[G367]] ordered [[G2004]] those [[G3588]] standing near [[G3936]] [Paul] [[G846]] to strike [[G5180]] him [[G846]] on the [[G3588]] mouth. [[G4750]] 
3 Then [[G5119]] Paul [[G3972]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] “God [[G2316]] will [[G3195]] strike [you], [[G5180]] you [[G4771]] whitewashed [[G2867]] wall! [[G5109]] You [[G4771]] sit [here] [[G2521]] to judge [[G2919]] me [[G1473]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] yet [[G2532]] you yourself violate the law [[G3891]] by commanding [[G2753]] that I [[G1473]] be struck. [[G5180]] 
4 But [[G1161]] those [[G3588]] standing nearby [[G3936]] said, [[G2036]] “How dare you insult [[G3058]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] of God!” [[G2316]] 
5 “Brothers,” [[G80]] Paul [[G3972]] replied, [[G5346]] “I was not aware [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G1510]] [the] high priest, [[G749]] for [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] ‘Do not speak [[G2046]] evil [[G2560]] [about the] ruler [[G758]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] people.’” [[G2992]] 
6 Then [[G1161]] Paul, [[G3972]] knowing [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] some of them [[G3313]] were [[G1510]] Sadducees [[G4523]] and [[G1161]] others [[G2087]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] called out [[G2896]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin, [[G4892]] “Brothers, [[G80]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] a Pharisee, [[G5330]] [the] son [[G5207]] of a Pharisee. [[G5330]] [It is] because of [[G4012]] [my] hope [[G1680]] in the resurrection [[G386]] of [the] dead [[G3498]] [that] I [[G1473]] am on trial. [[G2919]] 
7 As soon as [[G3778]] he [[G846]] had said [this], [[G2980]] a dispute [[G4714]] broke out [[G1096]] between the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] Sadducees, [[G4523]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] assembly [[G4128]] was divided. [[G4977]] 
8 For [[G1063]] [the] Sadducees [[G4523]] say [[G3004]] there is [[G1510]] neither [[G3361]] a resurrection, [[G386]] nor [[G3383]] angels, [[G32]] nor [[G3383]] spirits, [[G4151]] but [[G1161]] [the] Pharisees [[G5330]] acknowledge [[G3670]] them all. [[G297]] 
9 A great [[G3173]] clamor [[G2906]] arose, [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] scribes [[G1122]] from the [[G3588]] party [[G3313]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] got up [[G450]] [and] contended sharply, [[G1264]] “We find [[G2147]] nothing [[G3762]] wrong [[G2556]] with [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] man. [[G444]] What if [[G1487]] a spirit [[G4151]] or [[G2228]] an angel [[G32]] has spoken [[G2980]] to him? [[G846]] 
10 [The] dispute [[G4714]] grew [[G1096]] so violent [[G4183]] [that] the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] was afraid [[G5399]] they [[G846]] would tear Paul to pieces. [[G1288]] He ordered [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4753]] to go down [[G2597]] [and] remove him by force [[G726]] and [[G5037]] bring [him] [[G71]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] barracks. [[G3925]] 
11 The [[G3588]] following [[G1966]] night [[G3571]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] stood by [[G2186]] [Paul] [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Take courage! [[G2293]] As [[G5613]] you have testified [[G1263]] about [[G4012]] Me [[G1473]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] must [[G1163]] testify [[G3140]] in [[G1519]] Rome. [[G4516]] 
12 When daylight came, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] formed [[G4160]] a conspiracy [[G4963]] and bound themselves with an oath [[G332]] not [[G3383]] to eat [[G5315]] [or] [[G3383]] drink [[G4095]] until [[G2193]] they had killed [[G615]] Paul. [[G3972]] 
13 More than [[G4119]] forty [of them] [[G5062]] were [[G1510]] involved [[G4160]] in this [[G3778]] plot. [[G4945]] 
14 They [[G3748]] went [[G4334]] to the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “We have bound [[G332]] ourselves [[G1438]] with a solemn oath [[G331]] [not] to eat [[G1089]] [anything] [[G3367]] until [[G2193]] we have killed [[G615]] Paul. [[G3972]] 
15 Now [[G3568]] then, [[G3767]] you [[G4771]] and [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] petition [[G1718]] the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] to [[G3704]] bring him down [[G2609]] to [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] on the pretext [[G5613]] of examining [[G1231]] his case [[G3588]] more carefully. [[G199]] We [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] ready [[G2092]] to kill [[G337]] him [[G846]] on the way. [[G4253]] 
16 But [when] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Paul’s [[G3972]] sister [[G79]] heard about [[G191]] the [[G3588]] ambush, [[G1747]] he went [[G3854]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] barracks [[G3925]] [and] told [[G518]] Paul. [[G3972]] 
17 Then [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] called [[G4341]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] centurions [[G1543]] [and] said, [[G5346]] “Take [[G520]] this [[G3778]] young man [[G3494]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] commander; [[G5506]] he has [[G2192]] something [[G5100]] to tell [[G518]] him.” [[G846]] 
18 So [[G3767]] [the centurion] [[G3588]] took him [[G3880]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G5346]] “Paul [[G3972]] the [[G3588]] prisoner [[G1198]] sent [[G4341]] [and] asked [[G2065]] me [[G1473]] to bring [[G71]] this [[G3778]] young man [[G3495]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]] He has [[G2192]] something [[G5100]] to tell [[G2980]] you. [[G4771]] 
19 The [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] took [[G1949]] [the young man] [[G846]] by the [[G3588]] hand, [[G5495]] drew [him] [[G402]] aside, [[G2398]] and asked, [[G4441]] “What [[G5101]] do you need [[G2192]] to tell [[G518]] me?” [[G1473]] 
20 He answered, [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] have agreed [[G4934]] to ask [[G2065]] you [[G4771]] to [[G3704]] bring [[G2609]] Paul [[G3972]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] tomorrow, [[G839]] on the pretext [[G5613]] of acquiring [[G4441]] more information [[G199]] about [[G4012]] him. [[G846]] 
21 {Do} not {let} [[G3361]] them [[G846]] persuade [[G3982]] you, [[G4771]] because [[G1063]] more than [[G4119]] forty [[G5062]] men [[G435]] are waiting to ambush [[G1748]] him. [[G846]] [They] [[G3748]] have bound themselves with an oath [[G332]] not [[G3383]] to eat [[G5315]] [or] [[G3383]] drink [[G4095]] until [[G2193]] they have killed [[G337]] him; [[G846]] they are [[G1510]] ready [[G2092]] now, [[G3568]] awaiting [[G4327]] your [[G4771]] consent. [[G1860]] 
22 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] dismissed [[G630]] the [[G3588]] young man [[G3495]] and instructed [him], [[G3853]] “Do not tell [[G1583]] [anyone] [[G3367]] that [[G3754]] you have reported [[G1718]] this [[G3778]] to [[G4314]] me.” [[G1473]] 
23 Then [[G2532]] he called [[G4341]] two [[G1417]] of [his] [[G3588]] centurions [[G1543]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Prepare [[G2090]] two hundred [[G1250]] soldiers, [[G4757]] seventy [[G1440]] horsemen, [[G2460]] and [[G2532]] two hundred [[G1250]] spearmen [[G1187]] to [[G3704]] go [[G4198]] to [[G2193]] Caesarea [[G2542]] in [[G575]] the third [[G5154]] hour [[G5610]] of the [[G3588]] night. [[G3571]] 
24 Provide [[G3936]] mounts [[G2934]] [for] [[G1913]] Paul [[G3972]] to take [him] safely [[G1295]] to [[G4314]] Governor [[G2232]] Felix.” [[G5344]] 
25 [And] he wrote [[G1125]] the following [[G3778]] letter: [[G1992]] 
26 “Claudius [[G2804]] Lysias, [[G3079]] To [[G3588]] His Excellency, [[G2903]] Governor [[G2232]] Felix: [[G5344]] Greetings. [[G5463]] 
27 This [[G3778]] man [[G435]] was seized [[G4815]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] were about [[G3195]] to kill [him] [[G337]] when I came [[G2186]] with [[G4862]] [my] [[G3588]] troops [[G4753]] to rescue [him]. [[G1807]] For I had learned [[G3129]] that [[G3754]] he is [[G1510]] a Roman citizen, [[G4514]] 
28 and [[G5037]] since I wanted [[G1014]] to understand [[G1921]] [their] [[G3588]] charges [[G156]] [against] [[G1458]] him, [[G846]] I brought [him] down [[G2609]] to [[G1519]] their [[G846]] Sanhedrin. [[G4892]] 
29 I found that [[G2147]] the accusation [[G1458]] involved [[G4012]] questions [[G2213]] [about] [[G3588]] their [own] [[G846]] Law, [[G3551]] but [[G1161]] there was [[G2192]] no [[G3367]] charge [[G1462]] worthy [[G514]] of death [[G2288]] or [[G2228]] imprisonment. [[G1199]] 
30 [When] [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] was informed that [[G3377]] there was [[G1510]] a plot [[G1917]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] man, [[G435]] I sent [him] [[G3992]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] at once. [[G1824]] I also instructed [[G3853]] [his] [[G3588]] accusers [[G2725]] to present [[G3004]] [their case] [[G3588]] against [[G4314]] him [[G846]] before [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]] 
31 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] followed their orders [[G1299]] [and] brought [[G353]] Paul [[G3972]] by [[G1223]] night [[G3571]] to [[G1519]] Antipatris. [[G494]] 
32 The [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] they returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] barracks [[G3925]] [and] let [[G1439]] the [[G3588]] horsemen [[G2460]] go on [[G565]] with [[G4862]] him. [[G846]] 
33 [When the horsemen] [[G3748]] arrived [[G1525]] in [[G1519]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] they delivered [[G325]] the [[G3588]] letter [[G1992]] to the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] and [[G2532]] presented [[G3936]] Paul [[G3972]] to him. [[G846]] 
34 [The governor] read [the letter] [[G314]] and [[G2532]] asked [[G1905]] what [[G4169]] province [[G1885]] [Paul] was [[G1510]] from. [[G1537]] Learning [[G4441]] that [[G3754]] [he was] from [[G575]] Cilicia, [[G2791]] 
35 he said, [[G5346]] “I will hear your case [[G1251]] when [[G3752]] your [[G4771]] accusers [[G2725]] arrive.” [[G3854]] Then he ordered that [[G2753]] [Paul] [[G846]] be kept under guard [[G5442]] in [[G1722]] Herod’s [[G2264]] Praetorium. [[G4232]]
