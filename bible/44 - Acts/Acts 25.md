[[Acts 24|←]] • [[Acts 26|→]]
1 Three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] after [[G3326]] his arrival [[G1910]] in the [[G3588]] province, [[G1885]] Festus [[G5347]] went up [[G305]] from [[G575]] Caesarea [[G2542]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] 
2 [where] [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Jewish [[G2453]] leaders [[G4413]] presented their case [[G1718]] against [[G2596]] Paul. [[G3972]] They [[G2532]] urged [[G3870]] [Festus] [[G846]] 
3 to grant them [[G154]] a concession [[G5485]] against [[G2596]] [Paul] [[G846]] by [[G3704]] summoning [[G3343]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] [ because ] they were preparing [[G4160]] an ambush [[G1747]] to kill [[G337]] him [[G846]] along [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]] 
4 But [[G3767]] Festus [[G5347]] replied, [[G611]] “Paul [[G3972]] is being held [[G5083]] in [[G1519]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] and [[G1161]] [I myself] [[G1438]] am [[G3195]] going there [[G1607]] soon. [[G5034]] 
5 So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] [this] [[G3588]] man [[G435]] has done [[G1510]] anything [[G5100]] wrong, [[G824]] {let} some [[G3588]] of [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] leaders [[G1415]] come down with me [[G4782]] and accuse [[G2723]] him [there].” [[G846]] 
6 [After] [[G1161]] spending [[G1304]] no [[G3756]] more than [[G4119]] eight [[G3638]] or [[G2228]] ten [[G1176]] days [[G2250]] with [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] [Festus] went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Caesarea. [[G2542]] The [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] he sat [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat [[G968]] [and] ordered that [[G2753]] Paul [[G3972]] be brought in. [[G71]] 
7 [When] [[G1161]] [Paul] [[G846]] arrived, [[G3854]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] who had come down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] stood around [[G4026]] him, [[G846]] bringing [[G2702]] many [[G4183]] serious [[G926]] charges [[G157]] that [[G3739]] they could not [[G2480]] prove. [[G584]] 
8 [Then] [[G3588]] Paul [[G3972]] made his defense: [[G626]] “I have committed no offense [[G264]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] [or] [[G3777]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] [or] [[G3777]] against [[G1519]] Caesar.” [[G2541]] 
9 But [[G1161]] Festus, [[G5347]] wanting [[G2309]] to do the Jews a favor, [[G2698]] said [[G2036]] to Paul, [[G3972]] “Are you willing [[G2309]] to go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] to stand trial [[G2919]] before [[G1909]] me [[G1473]] on [[G4012]] these [charges]?” [[G3778]] 
10 Paul [[G3972]] replied, [[G2036]] “I am [[G1510]] standing [[G2476]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat [[G968]] of Caesar, [[G2541]] where [[G3757]] I [[G1473]] ought [[G1163]] to be tried. [[G2919]] I have done nothing wrong [[G91]] to [the] Jews, [[G2453]] as [[G5613]] you [[G4771]] [yourself] [[G2532]] know [[G1921]] very well. [[G2566]] 
11 If, [[G1487]] however, [[G3303]] I am guilty [[G91]] [of] [[G4238]] anything [[G5100]] worthy [[G514]] of death, [[G2288]] I do not refuse [[G3868]] to die. [[G599]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3762]] [truth] [[G3739]] to their [[G3778]] accusations [[G2723]] against me, [[G1473]] no one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] hand me over [[G5483]] to them. [[G846]] I appeal [[G1941]] to Caesar! [[G2541]] 
12 Then [[G5119]] Festus [[G5347]] conferred [[G4814]] with [[G3326]] [his] [[G3588]] council [[G4824]] [and] replied, [[G611]] “You have appealed [[G1941]] to Caesar. [[G2541]] To [[G1909]] Caesar [[G2541]] you will go!” [[G4198]] 
13 [After] [[G1161]] several [[G5100]] days [[G2250]] had passed, [[G1230]] King [[G935]] Agrippa [[G67]] and [[G2532]] Bernice [[G959]] came down [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Caesarea [[G2542]] to pay their respects [[G782]] to Festus. [[G5347]] 
14 Since [[G1161]] they were staying [[G1304]] several [[G4119]] days, [[G2250]] Festus [[G5347]] laid out [[G394]] Paul’s case [[G3972]] before the [[G3588]] king: [[G935]] “There is [[G1510]] a certain [[G5100]] man [[G435]] [whom] [[G5259]] Felix [[G5344]] left [[G2641]] in prison. [[G1198]] 
15 While I [[G1473]] was [[G1096]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] of the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] presented their case [[G1718]] [and] requested [[G154]] a judgment [[G2613]] against [[G2596]] him. [[G846]] 
16 I told [[G611]] [them] [[G3739]] it was [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] [the] Roman custom [[G1485]] to hand [[G5483]] a [[G5100]] man {over} [[G444]] before [[G4250]] [he] [[G3588]] has [[G2983]] [an] opportunity [[G5117]] to [[G2596]] face [[G4383]] [his] [[G3588]] accusers [[G2725]] and [[G5037]] defend himself [[G627]] against [[G4012]] [their] [[G3588]] charges. [[G1462]] 
17 So [when] [[G3767]] they [[G846]] came [[G4905]] here {with me}, [[G1759]] I did [[G4160]] not [[G3367]] delay. [[G311]] The [[G3588]] next [day] [[G1836]] I sat [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat [[G968]] [and] ordered that [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] man [[G435]] be brought in. [[G71]] 
18 [But when his] [[G3739]] accusers [[G2725]] rose to speak, [[G2476]] they did not charge [him] [[G156]] with [any of the] crimes [[G4190]] I [[G1473]] had expected. [[G5282]] 
19 They only had [[G2192]] some [[G5100]] contentions [[G2213]] with [[G4314]] him [[G846]] regarding [[G4012]] [their] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] religion [[G1175]] and [[G2532]] a certain [[G5100]] Jesus [[G2424]] [who] had died, [[G2348]] [but] whom [[G3739]] Paul [[G3972]] affirmed [[G5335]] to be alive. [[G2198]] 
20 [Since] [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] was at a loss [[G639]] as to [[G4012]] how to investigate [[G2214]] these [matters], [[G3778]] I asked [[G2036]] if [[G1487]] he was willing [[G1014]] to go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] and [[G2546]] be tried {there} [[G2919]] on [[G4012]] these [charges]. [[G3778]] 
21 But [when] [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] appealed [[G1941]] to be held over [[G5083]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] decision [[G1233]] of the [[G3588]] Emperor, [[G4575]] I ordered [[G2753]] him [[G846]] held [[G5083]] until [[G2193]] I could send [[G375]] him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] Caesar.” [[G2541]] 
22 Then [[G1161]] Agrippa [[G67]] [said] to [[G4314]] Festus, [[G5347]] “I would like [[G1014]] to hear [[G191]] [this] [[G3588]] man [[G444]] myself.” [[G846]] “Tomorrow [[G839]] you will hear [[G191]] him,” [[G846]] Festus declared. [[G5346]] 
23 The [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] Agrippa [[G67]] and [[G2532]] Bernice [[G959]] came [[G2064]] with [[G3326]] great [[G4183]] pomp [[G5325]] and [[G2532]] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] auditorium, [[G201]] along with [[G4862]] [the] commanders [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] leading [[G1851]] men [[G435]] of the [[G3588]] city. [[G4172]] And [[G2532]] Festus [[G5347]] ordered that [[G2753]] Paul [[G3972]] be brought in. [[G71]] 
24 Then [[G2532]] Festus [[G5347]] said, [[G5346]] “King [[G935]] Agrippa [[G67]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] [who] [[G435]] are present with [[G4840]] us, [[G1473]] you see [[G2334]] this [man]. [[G3778]] The [[G3588]] whole [[G537]] Jewish [[G2453]] community [[G4128]] has petitioned [[G1793]] me [[G1473]] about [[G4012]] [him], [[G3739]] both [[G5037]] here [[G1759]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] crying out [[G994]] [that] he ought [[G1163]] not [[G3361]] to live [[G2198]] [any] longer. [[G3371]] 
25 But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] found [[G2638]] he [[G846]] had done [[G4238]] nothing [[G3367]] worthy [[G514]] of death, [[G2288]] [and] since he [[G3778]] has now appealed to [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] Emperor, [[G4575]] I decided [[G2919]] to send [him]. [[G3992]] 
26 I have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3756]] definite [[G804]] to write [[G1125]] to [[G3588]] [our] sovereign one [[G2962]] about [[G4012]] [him]. [[G3739]] Therefore [[G1352]] I have brought [[G4254]] him [[G846]] before [[G1909]] all of you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] especially [[G3122]] before [[G1909]] you, [[G4771]] King [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] so that [[G3704]] after this inquiry [[G351]] I may have [[G2192]] something [[G5101]] to write. [[G1125]] 
27 For [[G1063]] it seems [[G1380]] unreasonable [[G249]] to me [[G1473]] to send on [[G3992]] a prisoner [[G1198]] without [[G3361]] specifying [[G4591]] the [[G3588]] charges [[G156]] against [[G2596]] him.” [[G846]]
