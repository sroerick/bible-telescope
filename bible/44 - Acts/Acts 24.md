1 Five [[G4002]] days [[G2250]] later, [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] Ananias [[G367]] came down [[G2597]] with [[G3326]] some [[G5100]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] a [[G5100]] lawyer [[G4489]] [named] Tertullus, [[G5061]] who [[G3748]] presented [[G1718]] to the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] {their case} against [[G2596]] Paul. [[G3972]] 
2 [When] [[G1161]] [Paul] [[G846]] had been called in, [[G2564]] Tertullus [[G5061]] opened [[G756]] the prosecution: [[G2723]] “Because of [[G1223]] you, [[G4771]] we have enjoyed [[G5177]] a lasting [[G4183]] peace, [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4674]] foresight [[G4307]] has brought [[G1096]] improvements [[G1357]] to this [[G3778]] nation. [[G1484]] 
3 In every way [[G3839]] and [[G2532]] everywhere, [[G3837]] most excellent [[G2903]] Felix, [[G5344]] we acknowledge [this] [[G588]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] gratitude. [[G2169]] 
4 But [[G1161]] in order [[G2443]] not to burden [[G1465]] you [[G4771]] any further, [[G4119]] I beg [[G3870]] your [[G4674]] indulgence [[G1932]] to hear [[G191]] us [[G1473]] briefly. [[G4935]] 
5 We have found [[G2147]] this [[G3778]] man [to be] [[G435]] a nuisance, [[G3061]] stirring up [[G2795]] dissension [[G4714]] among [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] all over [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G3625]] [He is] [[G5037]] a ringleader [[G4414]] of the [[G3588]] sect [[G139]] of the [[G3588]] Nazarenes, [[G3480]] 
6 [and he] [[G3739]] even [[G2532]] tried [[G3985]] to desecrate [[G953]] the [[G3588]] temple; [[G2411]] [so] [[G2532]] we seized [[G2902]] [him]. [[G3739]] 
7 But [[G1161]] Lysias [[G3079]] the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] having come up [[G3928]] with [[G3326]] great [[G4183]] force, [[G970]] took [him] away [[G520]] out of [[G1537]] our [[G1473]] hands, [[G5501]] 
8 By examining [[G350]] him [[G3739]] yourself, [[G846]] you will be able [[G1410]] to learn [the truth] [[G1921]] about [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] our [[G1473]] charges [[G2723]] [against] him.” [[G846]] 
9 The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] concurred, [[G4934]] asserting that [[G5335]] these [charges] [[G3778]] were [[G2192]] true. [[G3779]] 
10 [When] [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] motioned [[G3506]] for [Paul] [[G846]] to speak, [[G3004]] [he] [[G3972]] began his response: [[G611]] “Knowing that [[G1987]] you [[G4771]] have been [[G1510]] a judge [[G2923]] over [[G3588]] this [[G3778]] nation [[G1484]] for [[G1537]] many [[G4183]] years, [[G2094]] I gladly make my defense. [[G626]] 
11 You [[G4771]] can [[G1410]] verify {for yourself} [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] no [[G3756]] more than [[G4119]] twelve [[G1427]] days [[G2250]] ago [[G575]] I went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to worship. [[G4352]] 
12 Yet [[G2532]] [my accusers] did not find [[G2147]] me [[G1473]] debating [[G1256]] with [[G4314]] anyone [[G5100]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] or [[G2228]] riling up [[G4160]] a crowd [[G3793]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] [or] [[G3777]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] city. [[G4172]] 
13 Nor [[G3761]] can they [[G1410]] prove [[G3936]] to you [[G4771]] [any of] [[G4012]] their charges against [[G2723]] me. [[G1473]] 
14 I do confess [[G3670]] to you, [[G4771]] however, [[G1161]] that [[G3754]] I worship [[G3000]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of our fathers [[G3971]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Way, [[G3598]] which [[G3739]] they call [[G3004]] a sect. [[G139]] I believe [[G4100]] everything [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] is laid down [[G2596]] by the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Prophets, [[G4396]] 
15 [and] I have [[G2192]] [the same] [[G2532]] hope [[G1680]] in [[G1519]] God [[G2316]] that [[G3739]] they [[G846]] themselves [[G3778]] cherish, [[G4327]] [that] there will [[G3195]] be [[G1510]] a resurrection [[G386]] of both [[G5037]] [the] righteous [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] [the] wicked. [[G94]] 
16 In [[G1722]] this [hope], [[G3778]] I [[G846]] strive [[G778]] always [[G1223]] to maintain [[G2192]] a clear [[G677]] conscience [[G4893]] before [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] man. [[G444]] 
17 After [[G1223]] several [[G4119]] years, [[G2094]] then, [[G1161]] I returned [ to Jerusalem ] [[G3854]] to bring [[G4160]] alms [[G1654]] to [[G1519]] my [[G1473]] people [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] to present offerings. [[G4376]] 
18 At [[G1722]] the time [[G3739]] they found [[G2147]] me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] I was ceremonially clean [[G48]] [and] was not {inciting} [[G3326]] [a] crowd [[G3793]] [or] [[G3761]] an uproar. [[G2351]] But [there are] [[G1161]] some [[G5101]] Jews [[G2453]] from [[G575]] [the province of] Asia [[G773]] 
19 who [[G3739]] ought [[G1163]] to appear [[G3918]] before [[G1909]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] bring charges, [[G2723]] if [[G1487]] they have [[G2192]] anything [[G5100]] against [[G4314]] me. [[G1473]] 
20 Otherwise, [[G2228]] let [these men] state [[G2036]] for themselves [[G846]] any [[G5101]] crime [[G92]] they found [[G2147]] in me [[G1473]] when I stood [[G2476]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin, [[G4892]] 
21 unless [it was] [[G2228]] this [[G3778]] one [[G1520]] thing [[G3739]] I called out [[G2896]] as I stood [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] their [presence]: [[G846]] ‘[It is] concerning [[G4012]] [the] resurrection [[G386]] of [the] dead [[G3498]] [that] I [[G1473]] am on trial [[G2919]] before [[G1909]] you [[G4771]] today.’” [[G4594]] 
22 Then [[G1161]] Felix, [[G5344]] who was well informed [[G1492]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Way, [[G3598]] adjourned the hearing [[G306]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “When [[G3752]] Lysias [[G3079]] the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] comes, [[G2597]] I will decide [[G1231]] your case.” [[G4771]] 
23 He ordered [[G1299]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] to keep [Paul] under guard, [[G5083]] [but] [[G5037]] to allow him [[G2192]] some freedom [[G425]] and [[G2532]] permit [[G2967]] his [[G846]] [friends] [[G2398]] to minister [[G5256]] to his [needs]. [[G846]] 
24 After [[G3326]] several [[G5100]] days, [[G2250]] Felix [[G5344]] returned [[G3854]] with [[G4862]] [his] [[G2398]] wife [[G1135]] Drusilla, [[G1409]] who was [[G1510]] a Jewess. [[G2453]] He sent for [[G3343]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] listened to [[G191]] him [[G846]] [speak] about [[G4012]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
25 [As] [[G1161]] [Paul] [[G846]] expounded [[G1256]] on [[G4012]] righteousness, [[G1343]] self-control, [[G1466]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3195]] judgment, [[G2917]] Felix [[G5344]] became [[G1096]] frightened [[G1719]] [and] said, [[G611]] “You may go [[G4198]] for [[G3588]] now. [[G3568]] [When] [[G1161]] I find [[G3335]] the time, [[G2540]] I will call for [[G3333]] you. [[G4771]] 
26 At the same time [[G260]] he was hoping [[G1679]] that [[G3754]] Paul [[G3972]] would offer [[G1325]] him [[G846]] a bribe. [[G5536]] So [[G1352]] he sent for [[G3343]] [Paul] [[G846]] frequently [[G4437]] [and] talked [[G3656]] with him. [[G846]] 
27 [After] [[G1161]] two years [[G1333]] had passed, [[G4137]] Felix [[G5344]] was succeeded by [[G1240]] Porcius [[G4201]] Festus. [[G5347]] And [[G5037]] wishing [[G2309]] to do the Jews a favor, [[G2698]] Felix [[G5344]] left [[G2641]] Paul [[G3972]] in prison. [[G1210]]
