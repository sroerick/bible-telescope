1 “Brothers [[G80]] and [[G2532]] fathers, [[G3962]] listen [[G191]] now [[G3570]] to my [[G1473]] defense [[G627]] before [[G4314]] you.” [[G4771]] 
2 [When] [[G1161]] they heard [[G191]] him speak to [[G4377]] them [[G846]] in Aramaic, [[G1446]] they became [[G3930]] even more [[G3123]] silent. [[G2271]] Then [[G2532]] [Paul] declared, [[G5346]] 
3 “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] a Jew, [[G2453]] born [[G1080]] in [[G1722]] Tarsus [[G5019]] of Cilicia, [[G2791]] but [[G1161]] raised [[G397]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] city. [[G4172]] I was educated [[G3811]] at [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] of Gamaliel [[G1059]] in strict [[G195]] conformity [[G2596]] to the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of our fathers. [[G3971]] I am [[G5225]] {just as} zealous [[G2207]] for [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] as [[G2531]] any of [[G3956]] you [[G4771]] [here] [[G1510]] today. [[G4594]] 
4 [I] [[G3739]] persecuted [[G1377]] this [[G3778]] Way [[G3598]] even to the [[G891]] death, [[G2288]] detaining [[G1195]] both [[G5037]] men [[G435]] and [[G2532]] women [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] throwing them [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] prison, [[G5438]] 
5 as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] Council [[G4244]] can testify [[G3140]] about me. [[G1473]] I even obtained [[G1209]] letters [[G1992]] from [[G3844]] them [[G3739]] to [[G4314]] [their] [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] in [[G1519]] Damascus, [[G1154]] [and] I was on my way [[G4198]] to apprehend [[G1210]] [these people] [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] bring [them] [[G71]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to [[G2443]] be punished. [[G5097]] 
6 About [[G4012]] noon [[G3314]] [as] [[G1096]] I [[G1473]] was approaching [[G1448]] Damascus, [[G1154]] suddenly [[G1810]] a bright [[G2425]] light [[G5457]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] flashed [[G4015]] around [[G4012]] me. [[G1473]] 
7 I fell [[G4098]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1475]] and [[G2532]] heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] say [[G3004]] to me, [[G1473]] ‘Saul, [[G4549]] Saul, [[G4549]] why [[G5101]] do you persecute [[G1377]] Me?’ [[G1473]] 
8 ‘Who [[G5101]] are You, [[G1510]] Lord?’ [[G2962]] I [[G1473]] asked. [[G611]] ‘I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth, [[G3480]] whom [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] are persecuting,’ [[G1377]] He replied. [[G2036]] 
9 My companions [[G3588]] saw [[G2300]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] but [[G1161]] they could not understand [[G191]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] of the [One] [[G3588]] speaking [[G2980]] to me. [[G1473]] 
10 Then [[G1161]] I asked, [[G2036]] ‘What [[G5101]] shall I do, [[G4160]] Lord?’ [[G2962]] ‘Get up [[G450]] [and] go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] Damascus,’ [[G1154]] [He] [[G2962]] told [[G2036]] me. [[G1473]] ‘There [[G2546]] you [[G4771]] will be told [[G2980]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] have been appointed [[G5021]] to do.’ [[G4160]] 
11 Because [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] brilliance [[G1391]] of the [[G1565]] light [[G5457]] had blinded me, [[G1689]] my companions [[G3588]] led me by the hand [[G5496]] into [[G1519]] Damascus. [[G1154]] 
12 [There] [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] man [named] [[G435]] Ananias, [[G367]] a devout [[G2126]] observer [[G2596]] of the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] [who was] highly regarded [[G3140]] by [[G5259]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] living there, [[G2730]] 
13 came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] stood beside [[G2186]] me. [[G1473]] ‘Brother [[G80]] Saul,’ [[G4549]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘receive your sight.’ [[G308]] And [[G2504]] at [[G3588]] that [[G846]] [moment] [[G5610]] I could see [[G308]] him. [[G846]] 
14 Then [[G1161]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] has appointed [[G4400]] you [[G4771]] to know [[G1097]] His [[G846]] will, [[G2307]] and [[G2532]] to see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Righteous One, [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] to hear [[G191]] [His] voice. [[G5456]] 
15 You will be [[G1510]] His [[G846]] witness [[G3144]] to [[G4314]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] of what [[G3739]] you have seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] heard. [[G191]] 
16 And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] what [[G5101]] are you waiting for? [[G3195]] Get up, [[G450]] be baptized, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] wash [[G628]] your [[G4771]] sins {away}, [[G266]] calling on [[G1941]] His [[G846]] name.’ [[G3686]] 
17 Later, [[G1161]] [when] I [[G1473]] had returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] was praying [[G4336]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] I [[G1473]] fell [[G1096]] into [[G1722]] a trance, [[G1611]] 
18 and [[G2532]] saw [[G3708]] [the Lord] [[G846]] saying [[G3004]] to me, [[G1473]] ‘Hurry! [[G4692]] Leave [[G1831]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] quickly, [[G5034]] because [[G1360]] [the people here] will not accept [[G3858]] your [[G4771]] testimony [[G3141]] about [[G4012]] Me.’ [[G1473]] 
19 ‘Lord,’ [[G2962]] I [[G2504]] answered, [[G2036]] ‘they know very well [[G1987]] that [[G3754]] in one [[G2596]] synagogue [[G4864]] after another [[G3588]] I [[G1473]] imprisoned [[G5439]] and [[G2532]] beat [[G1194]] those who [[G3588]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] You. [[G4771]] 
20 And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Your [[G4771]] witness [[G3144]] Stephen [[G4736]] was shed, [[G1632]] I [[G846]] stood there [[G2186]] giving my approval [[G4909]] and [[G2532]] watching over [[G5442]] the [[G3588]] garments [[G2440]] of those who [[G3588]] killed [[G337]] him.’ [[G846]] 
21 Then [[G2532]] He said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] me, [[G1473]] ‘Go! [[G4198]] I [[G1473]] will send [[G1821]] you [[G4771]] far away [[G3112]] to [[G1519]] [the] Gentiles.’” [[G1484]] 
22 [The crowd] listened [[G191]] to [Paul] [[G846]] until [[G891]] he made this statement. [[G3056]] Then [[G2532]] they lifted up [[G1869]] their [[G846]] voices [[G5456]] [and] shouted, [[G3004]] “Rid [[G142]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] of [[G575]] [him]! [[G5108]] He is not fit [[G2520]] to live!” [[G2198]] 
23 [As] [[G5037]] they [[G846]] were shouting [[G2905]] and [[G2532]] throwing off [[G4495]] [their] [[G3588]] cloaks [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] tossing [[G906]] dust [[G2868]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] air, [[G109]] 
24 the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] ordered that [[G2753]] [Paul] [[G846]] be brought [[G1521]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] barracks. [[G3925]] He directed that [[G2036]] [Paul] [[G846]] be flogged [[G3148]] and interrogated [[G426]] to [[G2443]] determine [[G1921]] the reason [[G156]] for [[G1223]] this [[G3779]] outcry [[G2019]] against him. [[G846]] 
25 But [[G1161]] as [[G5613]] they stretched him out [[G4385]] to strap him down, [[G2438]] Paul [[G3972]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] standing there, [[G2476]] “Is it lawful [[G1832]] for you [[G4771]] to flog [[G3147]] a [[G444]] Roman citizen [[G4514]] without a trial?” [[G178]] 
26 [On] [[G1161]] hearing [this], [[G191]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] went [[G4334]] [and] reported [it] [[G518]] to the [[G3588]] commander. [[G5506]] “What [[G5101]] are you going [[G3195]] to do?” [[G4160]] he said. [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] is [[G1510]] a Roman citizen.” [[G4514]] 
27 The [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] went [[G4334]] to [Paul] [[G846]] and asked, [[G2036]] “Tell [[G3004]] me, [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] a Roman citizen?” [[G4514]] “Yes,” [[G3483]] he answered. [[G5346]] 
28 “I [[G1473]] paid [[G2932]] a high [[G4183]] price [[G2774]] [for my] [[G3588]] citizenship,” [[G4174]] said [[G611]] the [[G3588]] commander. [[G5506]] “But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] was born a citizen,” [[G1080]] Paul [[G3972]] replied. [[G5346]] 
29 Then [[G3767]] those who [[G3588]] were about [[G3195]] to interrogate [[G426]] [Paul] [[G846]] stepped back, [[G868]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] [himself] [[G1161]] was alarmed [[G5399]] when he realized [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] he had put [[G1210]] a Roman citizen {in chains}. [[G4514]] 
30 The [[G3588]] next day [the commander], [[G1887]] wanting [[G1014]] to learn [[G1097]] the real reason [[G804]] [Paul] was accused [[G2723]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] released [[G3089]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] ordered [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] to assemble. [[G4905]] Then [[G2532]] he brought [[G2609]] Paul {down} [[G3972]] and had him stand [[G2476]] before [[G1519]] them. [[G846]]
