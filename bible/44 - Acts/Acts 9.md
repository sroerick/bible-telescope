1 Meanwhile, [[G1161]] Saul [[G4569]] {was} still [[G2089]] breathing out [[G1709]] threats [[G547]] of murder [[G5408]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] disciples. [[G3101]] He went [[G4334]] to the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] 
2 to ask for [[G154]] letters [[G1992]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] in [[G1519]] Damascus, [[G1154]] so that [[G3704]] if [[G1437]] he found [[G2147]] any [[G5100]] men [[G435]] [or] [[G2532]] women [[G1135]] belonging [[G1510]] to the [[G3588]] Way, [[G3598]] he could bring them as prisoners [[G1210]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] 
3 [As] [[G1096]] [Saul] [[G846]] drew near [[G1448]] to Damascus [[G1154]] on [[G1722]] his journey, [[G4198]] suddenly [[G1810]] a light [[G5457]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] flashed around [[G4015]] him. [[G846]] 
4 He fell [[G4098]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1093]] [and] heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] say [[G3004]] to him, [[G846]] “Saul, [[G4549]] Saul, [[G4549]] why [[G5101]] do you persecute [[G1377]] Me?” [[G1473]] 
5 “Who [[G5101]] are You, [[G1510]] Lord?” [[G2962]] [Saul] asked. [[G2036]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] are persecuting,” [[G1377]] [He replied]. [[G1161]] 
6 “Now [[G235]] get up [[G450]] and [[G2532]] go into [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] you will be told [[G2980]] what [[G5101]] you [[G4771]] must [[G1163]] do.” [[G4160]] 
7 The [[G3588]] men [[G435]] traveling with [[G4922]] [Saul] [[G846]] stood [there] [[G2476]] speechless. [[G1769]] They heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] but [[G1161]] did not see [[G2334]] [anyone]. [[G3367]] 
8 Saul [[G4569]] got up [[G1453]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] ground, [[G1093]] but [[G1161]] when he opened [[G455]] his [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] he could not see [[G991]] [a thing]. [[G3762]] [So] [[G1161]] they led him by the hand [[G5496]] into [[G1519]] Damascus. [[G1154]] 
9 [For] [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] he was [[G1510]] without [[G3361]] sight, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] he did not eat [[G5315]] [or] [[G3761]] drink [anything]. [[G4095]] 
10 In [[G1722]] Damascus [[G1154]] there was [[G1510]] a [[G5100]] disciple [[G3101]] named [[G3686]] Ananias. [[G367]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] spoke [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a vision, [[G3705]] “Ananias!” [[G367]] “Here [[G2400]] I [am], [[G1473]] Lord,” [[G2962]] he answered. [[G2036]] 
11 “Get up!” [[G450]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] [told] [[G4314]] him. [[G846]] “Go [[G4198]] to [[G1909]] [the] house [[G3614]] of Judas [[G2455]] on [[G1722]] Straight [[G2117]] Street [[G4505]] and [[G2532]] ask for [[G2212]] [a man from] Tarsus [[G5018]] named [[G3686]] Saul, [[G4569]] for [[G1063]] he is [[G2400]] praying. [[G4336]] 
12 In [[G1722]] a vision [[G3705]] he has seen [[G3708]] a man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Ananias [[G367]] come [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] place [[G2007]] [his] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on him [[G846]] to [[G3704]] restore his sight.” [[G308]] 
13 But [[G1161]] Ananias [[G367]] answered, [[G611]] “Lord, [[G2962]] many [people] [[G4183]] have told me [[G191]] about [[G4012]] this [[G3778]] man [[G435]] [and] all [[G3745]] [the] harm [[G2556]] he has done [[G4160]] to [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] saints [[G40]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] 
14 And now [[G2532]] [he is] here [[G5602]] with [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] to arrest [[G1210]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] call on [[G1941]] Your [[G4771]] name.” [[G3686]] 
15 “Go!” [[G4198]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] “This [man] [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] chosen [[G1589]] instrument [[G4632]] to carry [[G941]] My [[G1473]] name [[G3686]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] and their [[G5037]] kings, [[G935]] and [[G5037]] [before the] people [[G5207]] of Israel. [[G2474]] 
16 I [[G1473]] will show [[G5263]] him [[G846]] how much [[G3745]] he [[G846]] must [[G1163]] suffer [[G3958]] for [[G5228]] My [[G1473]] name.” [[G3686]] 
17 [So] [[G1161]] Ananias [[G367]] went [[G565]] to the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] and [when] [[G2532]] he arrived, [[G1525]] he placed [[G2007]] [his] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] [Saul]. [[G846]] “Brother [[G80]] Saul,” [[G4549]] he said, [[G2036]] “the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] appeared [[G3708]] to you [[G4771]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] road [[G3598]] [as] [[G3739]] you were coming [here], [[G2064]] has sent [[G649]] me [[G1473]] so that [[G3704]] you may see again [[G308]] and [[G2532]] be filled [[G4130]] [with the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit.” [[G4151]] 
18 At that instant, [[G2112]] [something] like [[G5613]] scales [[G3013]] fell [[G634]] from [[G575]] [Saul’s] [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G5037]] his sight was restored. [[G308]] He got up [[G450]] [and] was baptized, [[G907]] 
19 and [[G2532]] after taking [[G2983]] [some] food, [[G5160]] he regained his strength. [[G1765]] And [[G1161]] he spent [[G1096]] several [[G5100]] days [[G2250]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] in [[G1722]] Damascus. [[G1154]] 
20 [Saul] promptly began to proclaim [[G2784]] Jesus [[G2424]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] [ declaring ], [[G3754]] “He [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God.” [[G2316]] 
21 All [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] heard [him] [[G191]] were amazed [[G1839]] and [[G2532]] asked, [[G2036]] “Isn’t [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] the [man who] [[G3588]] wreaked havoc [[G4199]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] on those [[G3588]] [who] call on [[G1941]] this [[G3778]] name? [[G3686]] And [[G2532]] hasn’t he come [[G2064]] here [[G5602]] to [[G2443]] take [[G71]] them [[G846]] as prisoners [[G1210]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] chief priests? [[G749]] 
22 But [[G1161]] Saul [[G4569]] was empowered [[G1743]] all the more, [[G3123]] and [[G2532]] he confounded [[G4797]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] living [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] Damascus [[G1154]] by proving [[G4822]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
23 After [[G5613]] many [[G2425]] days [[G2250]] had passed, [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] conspired [[G4823]] to kill [[G337]] him, [[G846]] 
24 but [[G1161]] Saul [[G4569]] learned of [[G1097]] their [[G846]] plot. [[G1917]] Day [[G2250]] and [[G5037]] night [[G3571]] they watched [[G3906]] the [[G3588]] [city] gates [[G4439]] in order [[G3704]] to kill [[G337]] him. [[G846]] 
25 One night, [[G3571]] however, [[G1161]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] took [him] [[G2983]] [and] lowered [him] [[G5465]] in [[G1722]] a basket [[G4711]] through [ a window ] [[G1223]] in the [[G3588]] wall. [[G5038]] 
26 [When] [[G1161]] [Saul] arrived [[G3854]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] he tried [[G3985]] to join [[G2853]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] [but] [[G2532]] they were all afraid of [[G5399]] him, [[G846]] not [[G3361]] believing [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G1510]] a disciple. [[G3101]] 
27 Then [[G1161]] Barnabas [[G921]] brought [him] [[G71]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] described [[G1334]] how [[G4459]] [Saul] had seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] [who] [[G3754]] spoke [[G2980]] to him [[G846]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] road [to Damascus], [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] [Saul] had spoken boldly [[G3955]] in [[G1722]] [that city] [[G1154]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus. [[G2424]] 
28 [So] [[G2532]] [Saul] stayed [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] moving about freely [[G1531]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] [and] speaking boldly [[G3955]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
29 He talked [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] debated [[G4802]] with [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Grecian Jews, [[G1675]] but [[G1161]] they tried [[G2021]] to kill [[G337]] him. [[G846]] 
30 [When] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] learned of [this], [[G1921]] they took him down [[G2609]] to [[G1519]] Caesarea [[G2542]] and [[G2532]] sent him off [[G1821]] to [[G1519]] Tarsus. [[G5019]] 
31 Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] throughout [[G2596]] Judea, [[G2449]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] Samaria [[G4540]] experienced [[G2192]] [a time of] peace. [[G1515]] It grew in strength [[G3618]] and [[G2532]] numbers, [[G4129]] living [[G4198]] in the [[G3588]] fear [[G5401]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] encouragement [[G3874]] of the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
32 As [[G1096]] Peter [[G4074]] traveled [[G1330]] throughout [[G1223]] [the area], [[G3956]] he went to [visit] [[G2718]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] [in] [[G2730]] Lydda. [[G3069]] 
33 There [[G1563]] he found [[G2147]] a [[G5100]] man [[G444]] named [[G3686]] Aeneas, [[G132]] who [[G3739]] had been [[G1510]] paralyzed [[G3886]] [and] bedridden [[G2621]] for [[G1537]] eight [[G3638]] years. [[G2094]] 
34 “Aeneas,” [[G132]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] “Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] heals [[G2390]] you! [[G4771]] Get up [[G450]] and [[G2532]] put away your mat.” [[G4766]] Immediately [[G2112]] [Aeneas] got up, [[G450]] 
35 and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] lived in [[G2730]] Lydda [[G3069]] and [[G2532]] Sharon [[G4565]] saw [[G3708]] him [[G846]] [and] [[G3748]] turned [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
36 In [[G1722]] Joppa [[G2445]] there was [[G1510]] a [[G5100]] disciple [[G3102]] named [[G3686]] Tabitha [[G5000]] (which [[G3739]] is translated [[G1329]] as [[G3004]] Dorcas), [[G1393]] who [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] always [[G4160]] occupied with [[G4134]] works [[G2041]] of kindness [[G18]] and [[G2532]] charity. [[G1654]] 
37 At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time, [[G2250]] however, [[G1161]] she became sick [[G770]] [and] [[G846]] died, [[G599]] and [[G1161]] her body was washed [[G3068]] [and] placed [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] an upper room. [[G5253]] 
38 [Since] [[G1161]] Lydda [[G3069]] was [[G1510]] near [[G1451]] Joppa, [[G2445]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Peter [[G4074]] was [[G1510]] [there] [[G846]] [and] sent [[G649]] two [[G1417]] men [[G435]] to urge [[G3870]] him, [[G846]] “Come [[G1330]] to [[G2193]] us [[G1473]] without [[G3361]] delay. [[G3635]] 
39 [So] [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] got up [[G450]] [and] went with [[G4905]] them. [[G846]] On his arrival, [[G3854]] they took [him] [[G321]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] upper room. [[G5253]] All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] widows [[G5503]] stood around [[G3936]] him, [[G846]] weeping [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] showing [him] [[G1925]] [the] tunics [[G5509]] and [[G2532]] [other] clothing [[G2440]] that [[G3745]] Dorcas [[G1393]] had made [[G4160]] while she was still [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]] 
40 Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] sent [[G1544]] them all [[G3956]] out of the room. [[G1854]] He knelt down [[G5087]] [and] prayed, [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] turning [[G1994]] toward [[G4314]] [her] [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] he said, [[G2036]] “Tabitha, [[G5000]] get up!” [[G450]] She opened [[G455]] her [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] seeing [[G3708]] Peter, [[G4074]] she sat up. [[G339]] 
41 [Peter] took [[G1325]] her [[G846]] by the hand [[G5495]] [and] helped her up. [[G450]] Then [[G1161]] he called [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] widows [[G5503]] [and] presented [[G3936]] her [to them] [[G846]] alive. [[G2198]] 
42 [This] became [[G1096]] known [[G1110]] all [[G3650]] over [[G2596]] Joppa, [[G2445]] and [[G2532]] many [people] [[G4183]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
43 And [[G1161]] [Peter] stayed for [[G3306]] several [[G2425]] days [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] Joppa [[G2445]] with [[G3844]] a [[G5100]] tanner [[G1038]] [named] Simon. [[G4613]]
