1 [When] [[G1161]] they had passed through [[G1353]] Amphipolis [[G295]] and [[G2532]] Apollonia, [[G624]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Thessalonica, [[G2332]] where [[G3699]] there was [[G1510]] a Jewish [[G2453]] synagogue. [[G4864]] 
2 As was [[G2596]] [his] [[G3588]] custom, [[G1486]] Paul [[G3972]] went into [[G1525]] [the synagogue], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] three [[G5140]] Sabbaths [[G4521]] he reasoned [[G1256]] with them [[G846]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures, [[G1124]] 
3 explaining [[G1272]] and [[G2532]] proving [[G3908]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] had to [[G1163]] suffer [[G3958]] and [[G2532]] rise [[G450]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]] “This [[G3778]] Jesus [[G2424]] I [[G1473]] am proclaiming [[G2605]] to you [[G4771]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ,” [[G5547]] [ he declared ]. [[G3754]] 
4 Some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] [the Jews] [[G846]] were persuaded [[G3982]] and [[G2532]] joined [[G4345]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas, [[G4609]] along with [[G5037]] a large [[G4183]] number [[G4128]] of [[G3588]] God-fearing [[G4576]] Greeks [[G1672]] and [[G5037]] [quite] [[G3756]] a few [[G3641]] leading [[G4413]] women. [[G1135]] 
5 The [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] however, [[G1161]] became jealous. [[G2206]] [So] [[G2532]] they brought in [[G4355]] some [[G5100]] troublemakers [[G4190]] from the [[G3588]] marketplace, [[G60]] formed a mob, [[G3792]] [and] sent the city into an uproar. [[G2350]] They raided [[G2186]] Jason’s [[G2394]] house [[G3614]] in search of [[G2212]] [Paul and Silas], [[G846]] [hoping] to bring them out [[G4254]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G1218]] 
6 But when [[G1161]] they could not find [[G2147]] them, [[G846]] they dragged [[G4951]] Jason [[G2394]] and [[G2532]] some other [[G5100]] brothers [[G80]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] city officials, [[G4173]] shouting, [[G994]] “These [men] [[G3778]] who [[G3588]] have turned [[G387]] the world {upside down} [[G3625]] have now come [[G3918]] here, [[G1759]] 
7 [and] Jason [[G2394]] has welcomed them into his home. [[G5264]] They [[G3778]] {are} all [[G3956]] defying [[G4238]] Caesar’s [[G2541]] decrees, [[G1378]] saying [[G3004]] there is [[G1510]] another [[G2087]] king, [[G935]] [ named ] Jesus!” [[G2424]] 
8 On hearing [[G191]] this, [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] city officials [[G4173]] were greatly disturbed. [[G5015]] 
9 And [[G2532]] after they had collected [[G2983]] bond [[G2425]] from [[G3844]] Jason [[G2394]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] others, [[G3062]] they released [[G630]] them. [[G846]] 
10 As soon as [[G2112]] night [had fallen], [[G3571]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] sent [[G1599]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas [[G4609]] {away} to [[G1519]] Berea. [[G960]] On arriving [there], [[G3854]] they went [[G549]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] synagogue. [[G4864]] 
11 Now [[G1161]] [the Bereans] [[G3778]] were [[G1510]] more noble-minded [[G2104]] than the [[G3588]] Thessalonians, [[G2332]] [for] [[G3748]] they received [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] with [[G3326]] great [[G3956]] eagerness [[G4288]] [and] examined [[G350]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures [[G1124]] every [[G2596]] day [[G2250]] [to see] if [[G1487]] these [teachings] [[G3778]] were [[G2192]] true. [[G3779]] 
12 As a result, [[G3767]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] believed, [[G4100]] along with [[G2532]] [quite] [[G3756]] a few [[G3641]] prominent [[G2158]] Greek [[G1674]] women [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] men. [[G435]] 
13 But [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] from [[G575]] Thessalonica [[G2332]] learned [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] Paul [[G3972]] was also proclaiming [[G2605]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] Berea, [[G960]] they went [[G2064]] there themselves [[G2546]] to incite [[G4531]] and [[G2532]] agitate [[G5015]] the [[G3588]] crowds. [[G3793]] 
14 The [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] immediately [[G2112]] sent [[G1821]] Paul [[G3972]] to [[G4198]] the [[G3588]] [coast], [[G2281]] [but] [[G5037]] Silas [[G4609]] and [[G2532]] Timothy [[G5095]] remained [[G5278]] [in Berea]. [[G1563]] 
15 Those who [[G3588]] escorted [[G2525]] Paul [[G3972]] brought [him] [[G71]] to [[G2193]] Athens [[G116]] and then [[G2532]] [returned] [[G1826]] with [[G2983]] instructions [[G1785]] for [[G4314]] Silas [[G4609]] and [[G2532]] Timothy [[G5095]] to [[G2443]] [join] [[G2064]] him [[G846]] as [[G5613]] soon as possible. [[G5033]] 
16 [While] [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] was waiting for [[G1551]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] Athens, [[G116]] he was deeply disturbed [[G3947]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] to see that [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] was [[G1510]] full of idols. [[G2712]] 
17 So [[G3767]] he reasoned [[G1256]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] with the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] God-fearing [Gentiles], [[G4576]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplace [[G58]] with [[G4314]] those [[G3588]] he met [[G3909]] each [[G3956]] day. [[G2250]] 
18 Some [[G5100]] Epicurean [[G1946]] and [[G2532]] Stoic [[G4770]] philosophers [[G5386]] also [[G2532]] began to debate [[G4820]] with him. [[G846]] Some [of them] [[G5100]] asked, [[G2036]] “What [[G5101]] {is} this [[G3778]] babbler [[G4691]] trying [[G2309]] to say?” [[G3004]] while [[G1161]] others [said], [[G3588]] “He seems [[G1380]] to be [[G1510]] advocating [[G2604]] foreign [[G3581]] gods.” [[G1140]] [They said this] because [[G3754]] [Paul] was proclaiming the good news [[G2097]] of Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] resurrection. [[G386]] 
19 So [[G5037]] they took [[G1949]] [Paul] [[G846]] [and] brought [him] [[G71]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Areopagus, [[G697]] [where] they asked [him], [[G3004]] “May we [[G1410]] know [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] new [[G2537]] teaching [is] [[G1322]] [that] you [[G4771]] are presenting? [[G2980]] 
20 For [[G1063]] you are bringing [[G1533]] some [[G5100]] strange notions [[G3579]] to [[G1519]] our [[G1473]] ears, [[G189]] [and] [[G3767]] we want [[G1014]] to know [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] [they] [[G3778]] mean.” [[G2309]] 
21 Now [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] [the] Athenians [[G117]] and [[G2532]] foreigners [[G3581]] who lived there [[G1927]] spent their time [[G2119]] [doing] [[G1519]] nothing [[G3762]] [more] [[G2087]] than [[G2228]] hearing [[G191]] and [[G2228]] articulating [[G3004]] new [ideas]. [[G2537]] 
22 Then [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] stood up [[G2476]] before [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] Areopagus [[G697]] [and] said, [[G5346]] “Men [[G435]] [of] Athens, [[G117]] I see [[G2334]] that [[G5613]] in [[G2596]] every way [[G3956]] you [are] [[G4771]] very religious. [[G1174]] 
23 For [[G1063]] as I walked around [[G1330]] and [[G2532]] examined [[G333]] your [[G4771]] objects of worship, [[G4574]] I even found [[G2147]] an altar [[G1041]] with [[G3739]] the inscription: [[G1924]] To an unknown [[G57]] God. [[G2316]] Therefore [[G3767]] what [[G3739]] you worship [[G2151]] as something unknown, [[G50]] I [[G1473]] [now] proclaim [[G2605]] to you. [[G4771]] 
24 The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] everything [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] it [[G846]] is [[G5225]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] of heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] [and] {does} not [[G3756]] live [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] temples [[G3485]] made by human hands. [[G5499]] 
25 Nor [[G3761]] is He served [[G2323]] by [[G5259]] human [[G442]] hands, [[G5495]] as if He needed [[G4326]] anything, [[G5100]] [because] He Himself [[G846]] gives [[G1325]] all [men] [[G3956]] life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] breath [[G4157]] and [[G2532]] everything [else]. [[G3956]] 
26 From [[G1537]] one [man] [[G1520]] He made [[G4160]] every [[G3956]] nation [[G1484]] of men, [[G444]] to inhabit [[G2730]] the whole [[G3956]] earth; [[G1093]] and He determined [[G3724]] [their] appointed [[G4367]] times [[G2540]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] boundaries [[G3734]] of their [[G846]] lands. [[G2733]] 
27 [ God intended that ] they would seek [[G2212]] [Him] [[G2316]] [and] perhaps [[G687]] reach out for [[G5584]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] find [Him], [[G2147]] though [[G2532]] He is [[G5225]] not [[G3756]] far [[G3112]] from [[G575]] each [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of us. [[G1473]] 
28 ‘For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] we live [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] move [[G2795]] and [[G2532]] have our being.’ [[G1510]] As [[G5613]] some [[G5100]] of your [[G4771]] [own] [[G3588]] poets [[G4163]] have said, [[G2046]] ‘We are [[G1510]] [His] [[G3588]] offspring.’ [[G1085]] 
29 Therefore, [[G3767]] being [[G5225]] offspring [[G1085]] of God, [[G2316]] we should [[G3784]] not [[G3756]] think [[G3543]] that the [[G3588]] Divine Being [[G2304]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] gold [[G5557]] or [[G2228]] silver [[G696]] or [[G2228]] stone, [[G3037]] an image formed [[G5480]] by man’s [[G444]] skill [[G5078]] and [[G2532]] imagination. [[G1761]] 
30 Although [[G3303]] God [[G2316]] overlooked [[G5237]] the [[G3588]] ignorance [[G52]] of [[G3588]] [earlier] times, [[G5550]] He now commands [[G3853]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] everywhere [[G3837]] to repent. [[G3340]] 
31 For [[G2530]] He has set [[G2476]] a day [[G2250]] when [[G3739]] He will [[G3195]] judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world [[G3625]] with [[G1722]] justice [[G1343]] by [[G1722]] the Man [[G435]] He has appointed. [[G3724]] He has given [[G3930]] proof [of this] [[G4102]] to all men [[G3956]] by raising [[G450]] Him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead.” [[G3498]] 
32 [When] [[G1161]] they heard about [[G191]] [the] resurrection [[G386]] of [the] dead, [[G3498]] some [[G3588]] began to mock [him], [[G5512]] but [[G1161]] [others] [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] “We want to hear [[G191]] you [[G4771]] again [[G3825]] on [[G4012]] this [topic].” [[G3778]] 
33 At that, [[G3779]] Paul [[G3972]] left [[G1831]] [the Areopagus]. [[G3319]] 
34 But [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] people [[G435]] joined [[G2853]] him [[G846]] [and] believed, [[G4100]] including [[G1722]] Dionysius [[G1354]] the [[G3588]] Areopagite, [[G698]] a woman [[G1135]] named [[G3686]] Damaris, [[G1152]] and [[G2532]] others [[G2087]] [who were] with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]]
