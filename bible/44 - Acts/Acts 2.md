# Acts 2
[[Acts 1|←]] • [[Acts 3|→]]
1 [When] [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of Pentecost [[G4005]] came, [[G4845]] [the believers] were [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] together [[G3674]] in [[G1909]] one [place]. [[G846]] 
2 Suddenly [[G869]] a sound [[G2279]] like [[G5618]] a mighty [[G972]] rushing [[G5342]] wind [[G4157]] came [[G1096]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] filled [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] house [[G3624]] where [[G3757]] they were [[G1510]] sitting. [[G2521]] 
3 They [[G846]] saw [[G3708]] tongues [[G1100]] like [[G5616]] flames of a fire [[G4442]] that separated [[G1266]] and [[G2532]] came to rest [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] each [[G1538]] of them. [[G846]] 
4 And [[G2532]] they {were} all [[G3956]] filled with [[G4130]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to speak [[G2980]] in other [[G2087]] tongues [[G1100]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] enabled [[G1325]] them. [[G846]] 
5 Now [[G1161]] there were [[G1510]] dwelling [[G2730]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] God-fearing [[G2126]] Jews [[G2453]] from [[G575]] every [[G3956]] nation [[G1484]] under [[G5259]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
6 And [when] [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] sound [[G5456]] rang out, [[G1096]] a crowd [[G4128]] came together [[G4905]] in bewilderment, [[G4797]] because [[G3754]] each [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] heard [[G191]] them [[G846]] speaking [[G2980]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] language. [[G1258]] 
7 In wonder [[G2296]] and [[G2532]] amazement, [[G1839]] they asked, [[G3004]] “Are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] these [men] [[G3778]] who [[G3588]] are speaking [[G2980]] Galileans? [[G1057]] 
8 How is it then that [[G4459]] each [[G1538]] of us [[G1473]] hears [them] [[G191]] in [[G1722]] his [[G1473]] own [[G2398]] native [[G1080]] language? [[G1258]] 
9 Parthians, [[G3934]] Medes, [[G3370]] and [[G2532]] Elamites; [[G1639]] residents [[G2730]] of [[G3588]] Mesopotamia, [[G3318]] Judea [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] Cappadocia, [[G2587]] Pontus [[G4195]] and [[G2532]] Asia, [[G773]] 
10 Phrygia [[G5435]] and [[G2532]] Pamphylia, [[G3828]] Egypt [[G125]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] parts [[G3313]] of Libya [[G3033]] near [[G2596]] Cyrene; [[G2957]] visitors [[G1927]] from Rome, [[G4514]] 
11 both [[G5037]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] converts to Judaism; [[G4339]] Cretans [[G2912]] and [[G2532]] Arabs— [[G690]] we hear [[G191]] them [[G846]] declaring [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] mighty works [[G3167]] of God [[G2316]] [in] our own [[G2251]] tongues!” [[G1100]] 
12 Amazed [[G1839]] and [[G2532]] perplexed, [[G1280]] they asked [[G3004]] one another, [[G243]] “What [[G5101]] does [[G2309]] this [[G3778]] mean?” [[G1510]] 
13 But [[G1161]] others [[G2087]] mocked [them] [[G5512]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “They are [[G1510]] drunk [[G3325]] on new wine!” [[G1098]] 
14 Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] stood up [[G2476]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] eleven, [[G1733]] lifted up [[G1869]] his [[G846]] voice, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] addressed [[G669]] [the crowd]: [[G846]] “Men [[G435]] of Judea [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] dwell [[G2730]] in Jerusalem, [[G2419]] let this be [[G1510]] known [[G1110]] to you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] listen carefully to [[G1801]] my [[G1473]] words. [[G4487]] 
15 These [men] [[G3778]] are not drunk [[G3184]] as [[G5613]] you [[G4771]] suppose. [[G5274]] It is [[G1510]] [only the] third [[G5154]] hour [[G5610]] of the [[G3588]] day! [[G2250]] 
16 No, [[G235]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] what [[G3588]] was spoken [[G2046]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Joel: [[G2493]] 
17 ‘In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] days, [[G2250]] God [[G2316]] says, [[G3004]] I will pour out [[G1632]] My [[G1473]] Spirit [[G4151]] on [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] people; [[G4561]] your [[G4771]] sons [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] daughters [[G2364]] will prophesy, [[G4395]] your [[G4771]] young men [[G3495]] will see [[G3708]] visions, [[G3706]] your [[G4771]] old men [[G4245]] will dream [[G1797]] dreams. [[G1798]] 
18 Even [[G1065]] on [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] servants, [[G1401]] [both men] and [[G2532]] [women], [[G1399]] I will pour out [[G1632]] My [[G1473]] Spirit [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] they will prophesy. [[G4395]] 
19 I will show [[G1325]] wonders [[G5059]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] above [[G507]] and [[G2532]] signs [[G4592]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] below, [[G2736]] blood [[G129]] and [[G2532]] fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] clouds [[G822]] of smoke. [[G2586]] 
20 The [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] will be turned [[G3344]] to [[G1519]] darkness, [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] moon [[G4582]] to [[G1519]] blood, [[G129]] before [[G4250]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G2064]] [of the] great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] glorious [[G2016]] day [[G2250]] of [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
21 And [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3739]] calls on [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] will be saved.’ [[G4982]] 
22 Men [[G435]] of Israel, [[G2475]] listen to [[G191]] this [[G3778]] message: [[G3056]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth [[G3480]] [was] a man [[G435]] certified [[G584]] by [[G575]] God [[G2316]] to [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] by miracles, [[G1411]] wonders, [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] signs, [[G4592]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] did [[G4160]] among you [[G3319]] through [[G1223]] Him, [[G846]] as [[G2531]] you yourselves [[G846]] know. [[G1492]] 
23 He [[G3778]] was handed over [[G1560]] by [[G3588]] God’s [[G2316]] set [[G3724]] plan [[G1012]] and [[G2532]] foreknowledge, [[G4268]] {and you}, by [[G1223]] the hands [[G5495]] of the lawless, [[G459]] put [Him] to death [[G337]] by nailing [Him] to the cross. [[G4362]] 
24 [But] [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] raised Him from the dead, [[G450]] releasing [Him] [[G3089]] from the [[G3588]] agony [[G5604]] of [[G3588]] death, [[G2288]] because [[G2530]] it was [[G1510]] impossible [[G1415]] [for] Him [[G846]] to be held [[G2902]] in [[G5259]] its [clutches]. [[G846]] 
25 David [[G1138]] says [[G3004]] about [[G1519]] Him: [[G846]] ‘I saw [[G4308]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] always [[G1223]] before [[G1799]] me; [[G1473]] because [[G3754]] He is [[G1510]] at [[G1537]] my [[G1473]] right hand, [[G1188]] I will not be shaken. [[G4531]] 
26 Therefore [[G1223]] my [[G1473]] heart [[G2588]] is glad [[G2165]] and [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] tongue [[G1100]] rejoices; [[G21]] my [[G1473]] body [[G4561]] also [[G2532]] will live [[G2681]] in [[G1909]] hope, [[G1680]] 
27 because [[G3754]] You will not abandon [[G1459]] my [[G1473]] soul [[G5590]] to [[G1519]] Hades, [[G86]] nor [[G3761]] will You let [[G1325]] Your [[G4771]] Holy One [[G3741]] see [[G3708]] decay. [[G1312]] 
28 You have made known [[G1107]] to me [[G1473]] [the] paths [[G3598]] of life; [[G2222]] You will fill [[G4137]] me [[G1473]] with joy [[G2167]] in [[G3326]] Your [[G4771]] presence.’ [[G4383]] 
29 Brothers, [[G80]] I can [[G1832]] tell [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] with confidence [[G3954]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] patriarch [[G3966]] David [[G1138]] died [[G5053]] and [[G2532]] was buried, [[G2290]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] tomb [[G3418]] is [[G1510]] with [[G1722]] us [[G1473]] to [[G891]] this [[G3778]] day. [[G2250]] 
30 [But] [[G3767]] he was [[G5225]] a prophet [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] had promised [[G3660]] him [[G846]] on oath [[G3727]] that He would place [[G2523]] [one] of [[G1537]] [his descendants] [[G3751]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] throne. [[G2362]] 
31 Foreseeing this, [[G4308]] [David] spoke [[G2980]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] of the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G3754]] He was not abandoned [[G1459]] to [[G1519]] Hades, [[G86]] nor [[G3777]] {did] His [[G846]] body [[G4561]] see [[G3708]] decay. [[G1312]] 
32 God [[G2316]] has raised [[G450]] this [[G3778]] Jesus {to life}, [[G2424]] to which [[G3739]] we [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] witnesses. [[G3144]] 
33 Exalted, [[G5312]] then, [[G3767]] to the [[G3588]] right hand [[G1188]] of God, [[G2316]] He has received [[G2983]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] promised [[G1860]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] [and] has poured out [[G1632]] what [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] now [[G2532]] see [[G991]] and [[G2532]] hear. [[G191]] 
34 For [[G1063]] David [[G1138]] {did} not [[G3756]] ascend [[G305]] into [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] but [[G1161]] he himself [[G846]] says: [[G3004]] ‘The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] Lord, [[G2962]] “Sit [[G2521]] at [[G1537]] My [[G1473]] right hand, [[G1188]] 
35 until [[G2193]] I make [[G5087]] Your [[G4771]] enemies [[G2190]] a footstool [[G5286]] for [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] feet.”’ [[G4228]] 
36 Therefore [[G3767]] {let} all [[G3956]] Israel [[G2474]] know [[G1097]] with certainty [[G806]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] has made [[G4160]] this [[G3778]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] crucified, [[G4717]] both [[G2532]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Christ!” [[G5547]] 
37 [When] [[G1161]] [the people] heard [this], [[G191]] they were cut [[G2660]] to the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] and [[G5037]] asked [[G2036]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] apostles, [[G652]] “Brothers, [[G80]] what [[G5101]] shall we do?” [[G4160]] 
38 Peter [[G4074]] replied, [[G5346]] “Repent [[G3340]] and [[G2532]] be baptized, [[G907]] every one [[G1538]] of you, [[G4771]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] for the [[G1519]] forgiveness [[G859]] of your [[G4771]] sins, [[G266]] and [[G2532]] you will receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] of the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
39 [This] [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] belongs [[G1510]] to you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] to [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] children [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] to all [[G3956]] who [are] [[G3588]] far off, [[G3112]] to all whom [[G3745]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] will call to Himself.” [[G4341]] 
40 With [[G5037]] many [[G4119]] other [[G2087]] words [[G3056]] he testified, [[G1263]] and [[G2532]] he urged [[G3870]] them, [[G846]] “Be saved [[G4982]] from [[G575]] this [[G3778]] corrupt [[G4646]] generation.” [[G1074]] 
41 Those who [[G3588]] embraced [[G588]] his [[G846]] message [[G3056]] were baptized, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] about [[G5616]] three thousand [[G5153]] were added [[G4369]] [ to the believers ] [[G5590]] that [[G1565]] day. [[G2250]] 
42 They [[G1510]] devoted themselves [[G4342]] to [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] apostles’ [[G652]] teaching [[G1322]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] fellowship, [[G2842]] to the [[G3588]] breaking [[G2800]] of bread [[G740]] and [[G2532]] to [[G3588]] prayer. [[G4335]] 
43 A sense of awe [[G5401]] came over [[G1096]] everyone, [[G3956]] and [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] performed [[G1096]] many [[G4183]] wonders [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] signs. [[G4592]] 
44 All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] believers [[G4100]] were [[G1510]] together [[G1909]] and [[G2532]] had [[G2192]] everything [[G537]] in common. [[G2839]] 
45 Selling [[G4097]] [their] [[G3588]] possessions [[G2933]] and [[G2532]] goods, [[G5223]] they shared with [[G1266]] anyone [[G5100]] who was in [[G2192]] need. [[G5532]] 
46 With one accord [[G3661]] they continued [to meet] [[G4342]] daily [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [courts] [[G2411]] and [[G5037]] to break [[G2806]] bread [[G740]] from [[G2596]] house [to house], [[G3624]] sharing [[G3335]] [their] meals [[G5160]] with [[G1722]] gladness [[G20]] and [[G2532]] sincerity [[G858]] of heart, [[G2588]] 
47 praising [[G134]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] enjoying [[G2192]] [the] favor [[G5485]] of [[G4314]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]] And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] added [[G4369]] to [[G1909]] their [[G3588]] number [[G846]] daily [[G2250]] those who [[G3588]] were being saved. [[G4982]]
