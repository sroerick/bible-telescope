[[Revelation 10|←]] • [[Revelation 12|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] was given [[G1325]] a measuring rod [[G2563]] like [[G3664]] a staff [[G4464]] [and] was told, [[G3004]] “Go [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] measure [[G3354]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] and [[G2532]] [ count the number ] of [[G3588]] worshipers [[G4352]] [there]. [[G846]] 
2 [But] [[G2532]] exclude [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] courtyard [[G833]] outside [[G1855]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G3485]] {Do} not [[G3361]] measure [[G3354]] it, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] it has been given [over] [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] nations, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] they will trample [[G3961]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] city [[G4172]] for 42 [[G5062]] months. [[G3376]] 
3 And [[G2532]] I will empower [[G1325]] my [[G1473]] two [[G1417]] witnesses, [[G3144]] and [[G2532]] they will prophesy [[G4395]] for 1,260 [[G5507]] days, [[G2250]] clothed in [[G4016]] sackcloth.” [[G4526]] 
4 These [witnesses] [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] olive trees [[G1636]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] lampstands [[G3087]] that stand [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] 
5 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] wants [[G2309]] to harm [[G91]] them, [[G846]] fire [[G4442]] proceeds [[G1607]] from [[G1537]] their [[G846]] mouths [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] devours [[G2719]] their [[G846]] enemies. [[G2190]] In this way, [[G3779]] anyone who [[G5100]] wants [[G2309]] to harm [[G91]] them [[G846]] must [[G1163]] be killed. [[G615]] 
6 These [witnesses] [[G3778]] have [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] to shut [[G2808]] the [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] so that [[G2443]] no [[G3361]] rain [[G5205]] will fall [[G1026]] during the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] prophecy, [[G4394]] and [[G2532]] power [[G1849]] to turn [[G4762]] the [[G3588]] waters [[G5204]] into [[G1519]] blood, [[G129]] and [[G2532]] to strike [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] with [[G1722]] every kind of [[G3956]] plague [[G4127]] as often as [[G3740]] they wish. [[G2309]] 
7 When [[G3752]] [the two witnesses] have finished [[G5055]] their [[G846]] testimony, [[G3141]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] that [[G3588]] comes up [[G305]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Abyss [[G12]] will wage [[G4160]] war [[G4171]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] will overpower [[G3528]] and [[G2532]] kill [[G615]] them. [[G846]] 
8 Their [[G846]] bodies [[G4430]] [will lie] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] street [[G4113]] of [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] city— [[G4172]] figuratively [[G4153]] called [[G2564]] Sodom [[G4670]] and [[G2532]] Egypt— [[G125]] where [[G3699]] their [[G846]] Lord [[G2962]] was also crucified. [[G4717]] 
9 For three [[G5140]] and [[G2532]] a half [[G2255]] days [[G2250]] all [[G1537]] peoples [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] tribes [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] tongues [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] nations [[G1484]] will view [[G991]] their [[G846]] bodies [[G4430]] and [[G2532]] will not permit [[G863]] [them] [[G4430]] to be laid [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] a tomb. [[G3418]] 
10 And [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] will gloat [[G5463]] over [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] will celebrate [[G2165]] and [[G2532]] send [[G3992]] one another [[G240]] gifts, [[G1435]] because [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] two [[G1417]] prophets [[G4396]] had tormented [[G928]] [them]. [[G1093]] 
11 [But] [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] three [[G5140]] and [[G2532]] a half [[G2255]] days, [[G2250]] [the] breath [[G4151]] of life [[G2222]] from [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] entered [[G1525]] [the two witnesses], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they stood [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] fear [[G5401]] fell [[G1968]] upon [[G1909]] those who [[G3588]] saw [[G2334]] them. [[G846]] 
12 And [[G2532]] [the witnesses] heard [[G191]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] saying, [[G3004]] “Come up [[G305]] here.” [[G5602]] And [[G2532]] they went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] in [[G1722]] a [[G3588]] cloud [[G3507]] [as] [[G2532]] their [[G846]] enemies [[G2190]] watched [[G2334]] them. [[G846]] 
13 And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] hour [[G5610]] there was [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] earthquake, [[G4578]] and [[G2532]] a [[G3588]] tenth [[G1182]] of the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] collapsed. [[G4098]] Seven [[G2033]] thousand [[G5505]] were killed [[G615]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] quake, [[G4578]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] were [[G1096]] terrified [[G1719]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] to the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
14 The [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] woe [[G3759]] has passed. [[G565]] Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] woe [[G3759]] is coming [[G2064]] quickly. [[G5035]] 
15 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] angel [[G32]] sounded [his] trumpet, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] loud [[G3173]] voices [[G5456]] called out [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] “The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] has become [[G1096]] [the kingdom] [[G3588]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] He will reign [[G936]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] 
16 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] twenty-four [[G1501]] elders [[G4245]] who [[G3588]] sit [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] thrones [[G2362]] before [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] faces [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] worshiped [[G4352]] God, [[G2316]] 
17 saying: [[G3004]] “We give thanks [[G2168]] to You, [[G4771]] O Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty, [[G3841]] the [One who] [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] who [[G3588]] was; [[G1510]] You have taken [[G2983]] Your [[G4771]] great [[G3173]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] begun to reign. [[G936]] 
18 The [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] were enraged, [[G3710]] and [[G2532]] Your [[G4771]] wrath [[G3709]] has come. [[G2064]] The [[G3588]] time [has come] [[G2540]] to judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] to reward [[G3408]] Your [[G4771]] servants, [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] saints, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] fear [[G5399]] Your [[G4771]] name, [[G3686]] [both] [[G3588]] small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great, [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] to destroy [[G1311]] those who [[G3588]] destroy [[G1311]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] 
19 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] was opened, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ark [[G2787]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] covenant [[G1242]] appeared [[G3708]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] temple. [[G3485]] And [[G2532]] there were [[G1096]] flashes of lightning, [[G796]] and [[G2532]] rumblings, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] peals of thunder, [[G1027]] and [[G2532]] an earthquake, [[G4578]] and [[G2532]] a great [[G3173]] hailstorm.
