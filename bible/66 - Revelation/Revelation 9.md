[[Revelation 8|←]] • [[Revelation 10|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fifth [[G3991]] angel [[G32]] sounded [his] trumpet, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] a star [[G792]] that had fallen [[G4098]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] to [[G1519]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] it was given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] key [[G2807]] to the [[G3588]] pit [[G5421]] of the [[G3588]] Abyss. [[G12]] 
2 [The star] opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] pit [[G5421]] of the [[G3588]] Abyss, [[G12]] and [[G2532]] smoke [[G2586]] rose [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] [it] [[G5421]] like [[G5613]] [the] smoke [[G2586]] of a great [[G3173]] furnace, [[G2575]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] air [[G109]] were darkened [[G4656]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] smoke [[G2586]] from the [[G3588]] pit. [[G5421]] 
3 And [[G2532]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] smoke, [[G2586]] locusts [[G200]] descended on [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] were given [[G1325]] power [[G1849]] like [[G5613]] [that of] [[G1849]] the [[G3588]] scorpions [[G4651]] of the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] 
4 They [[G846]] were told [[G2046]] not [[G3361]] to harm [[G91]] the [[G3588]] grass [[G5528]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] [or] [[G3761]] any [[G3956]] plant [[G5515]] [or] [[G3761]] tree, [[G1186]] but only [[G1487]] those [[G3588]] who [[G3748]] did not have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seal [[G4973]] of God [[G2316]] on [[G1909]] [their] [[G3588]] foreheads. [[G3359]] 
5 [The locusts] [[G846]] were not given power [[G1325]] to [[G2443]] kill [[G615]] them, [[G846]] but only [[G235]] to [[G2443]] torment [them] [[G928]] [for] five [[G4002]] months, [[G3376]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] torment [[G929]] [was] like [[G5613]] the stinging [[G3817]] of a scorpion. [[G4651]] 
6 In [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] men [[G444]] will seek [[G2212]] death [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] will not find [[G2147]] it; [[G846]] they will long [[G1937]] to die, [[G599]] [but] [[G2532]] death [[G2288]] will escape [[G5343]] them. [[G846]] 
7 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] locusts [[G200]] looked [[G3667]] like [[G3664]] horses [[G2462]] prepared [[G2090]] for [[G1519]] battle, [[G4171]] [with something] [[G5613]] like [[G3664]] crowns [[G4735]] of gold [[G5557]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] heads, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] faces [[G4383]] like [[G5613]] [the] faces [[G4383]] of men. [[G444]] 
8 They had [[G2192]] hair [[G2359]] like [[G5613]] [that] [[G2359]] of women, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] teeth [[G3599]] like [those] [[G5613]] of lions. [[G3023]] 
9 They also had [[G2192]] thoraxes [[G2382]] like [[G5613]] breastplates [[G2382]] of iron, [[G4603]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sound [[G5456]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] wings [[G4420]] [was] like [[G5613]] [the] roar [[G5456]] of many [[G4183]] horses [[G2462]] [and] chariots [[G716]] rushing [[G5143]] into [[G1519]] battle. [[G4171]] 
10 They had [[G2192]] tails [[G3769]] with [[G2532]] stingers [[G2759]] like [[G3664]] scorpions, [[G4651]] [which] [[G3769]] had [[G846]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1849]] to injure [[G91]] people [[G444]] for five [[G4002]] months. [[G3376]] 
11 They were ruled by [[G2192]] a king, [[G935]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of the [[G3588]] Abyss. [[G12]] His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] in Hebrew [[G1447]] [is] Abaddon, [[G3]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Greek [[G1673]] [it is] [[G3686]] Apollyon. [[G623]] 
12 The [[G3588]] first [[G1520]] woe [[G3759]] has passed. [[G565]] Behold, [[G2400]] two [[G1417]] woes [[G3759]] [are] still [[G2089]] to follow. [[G2064]] 
13 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sixth [[G1623]] angel [[G32]] sounded [his] trumpet, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a [[G1520]] voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] horns [[G2768]] of the [[G3588]] golden [[G5552]] altar [[G2379]] before [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] 
14 saying [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] sixth [[G1623]] angel [[G32]] with [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] trumpet, [[G4536]] “Release [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] angels [[G32]] who [[G3588]] are bound [[G1210]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] river [[G4215]] Euphrates.” [[G2166]] 
15 [So] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] angels [[G32]] who [[G3588]] had been prepared [[G2090]] for [[G1519]] [this] [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] month [[G3376]] and [[G2532]] year [[G1763]] were released [[G3089]] to [[G2443]] kill [[G615]] a [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of mankind. [[G444]] 
16 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of mounted [[G2461]] troops [was] [[G4753]] two hundred million; [[G1364]] I heard [[G191]] their [[G846]] number. [[G706]] 
17 [Now] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] horses [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] riders [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] [my] [[G3588]] vision [[G3706]] looked like [[G3708]] this: [[G3779]] [The riders] had [[G2192]] breastplates [the colors of] [[G2382]] fire, [[G4447]] sapphire, [[G5191]] and [[G2532]] brimstone. [[G2306]] The [[G3588]] heads [[G2776]] of the [[G3588]] horses [were] [[G2462]] like [[G5613]] [the] heads [[G2776]] of lions, [[G3023]] and [[G2532]] out of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] mouths [[G4750]] came [[G1607]] fire, [[G4442]] smoke, [[G2586]] and [[G2532]] brimstone. [[G2303]] 
18 A [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of [[G3588]] mankind [[G444]] was killed [[G615]] by [[G575]] [the] [[G3778]] three [[G5140]] plagues [[G4127]] of [[G1537]] fire, [[G4442]] smoke, [[G2586]] and [[G2532]] brimstone [[G2303]] that [[G3588]] proceeded [[G1607]] from [[G1537]] their [[G846]] mouths. [[G4750]] 
19 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1849]] of the [[G3588]] horses [[G2462]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] mouths [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] tails; [[G3769]] indeed, [[G1063]] their [[G846]] tails [[G3769]] [were] like [[G3664]] snakes, [[G3789]] having [[G2192]] heads [[G2776]] with which [[G1722]] to inflict harm. [[G91]] 
20 The [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] of [[G3588]] mankind [[G444]] who [[G3739]] were not killed [[G615]] by [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] plagues [[G4127]] still did not repent [[G3340]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of their [[G846]] hands. [[G5495]] They did not stop worshiping [[G4352]] demons [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] idols of [[G1497]] gold, [[G5552]] silver, [[G693]] bronze, [[G5470]] stone, [[G3035]] and [[G2532]] wood, [[G3585]] which [[G3739]] cannot [[G1410]] see [[G991]] [or] [[G3777]] hear [[G191]] [or] [[G3777]] walk. [[G4043]] 
21 Furthermore, [[G2532]] they did not repent [[G3340]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] murder, [[G5408]] sorcery, [[G5333]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] [and] [[G3777]] theft. [[G2809]]
