# Revelation 22
[[Revelation 21|←]]
1 Then [[G2532]] [the angel] showed [[G1166]] me [[G1473]] a river [[G4215]] of the water [[G5204]] of life, [[G2222]] as clear [[G2986]] as [[G5613]] crystal, [[G2930]] flowing [[G1607]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] 
2 down [[G1722]] the middle [[G3319]] of the [[G3588]] main street [[G4113]] of [the city]. [[G846]] On either side [[G1782]] of the [[G3588]] river [[G4215]] stood a tree [[G3586]] of life, [[G2222]] producing [[G4160]] twelve [[G1427]] kinds of fruit [[G2590]] [and] yielding [[G591]] [a fresh] [[G846]] crop [[G2590]] for [[G2596]] each [[G1538]] month. [[G3376]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] leaves [[G5444]] of the [[G3588]] tree [[G3586]] [are] for [[G1519]] [the] healing [[G2322]] of the [[G3588]] nations. [[G1484]] 
3 No [[G3756]] longer [[G2089]] will there be [[G1510]] any [[G3956]] curse. [[G2652]] The [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] will be [[G1510]] within [[G1722]] [the city], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] will worship [[G3000]] Him. [[G846]] 
4 They will see [[G3708]] His [[G846]] face, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] [will be] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] foreheads. [[G3359]] 
5 There will be [[G1510]] no more [[G3756]] night [[G3571]] [in the city], [[G2089]] and [[G2532]] they will have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] for [the] light [[G5457]] of a lamp [[G3088]] [or] [[G2532]] of [the] sun. [[G2246]] For [[G3754]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] will shine [[G5461]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they will reign [[G936]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] 
6 Then [[G2532]] [the angel] said [[G2036]] to me, [[G1473]] “These [[G3778]] words [[G3056]] [are] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] true. [[G228]] The [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of the [[G3588]] spirits [[G4151]] of the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] has sent [[G649]] His [[G846]] angel [[G32]] to show [[G1166]] His [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] what [[G3739]] must [[G1163]] soon [[G5034]] take place. [[G1096]] 
7 “Behold, [[G2400]] I am coming [[G2064]] quickly. [[G5035]] Blessed [is] [[G3107]] the [one who] [[G3588]] keeps [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] prophecy [[G4394]] in [[G3588]] this [[G3778]] book.” [[G975]] 
8 And I [am] [[G2504]] John, [[G2491]] the [one who] [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G991]] these things. [[G3778]] And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] I had heard [[G191]] and [[G2532]] seen [them], [[G991]] I fell down [[G4098]] to worship [[G4352]] at [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] of the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] who [[G3588]] had shown [[G1166]] me [[G1473]] these things. [[G3778]] 
9 [But] [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] to me, [[G1473]] “Do not do that! [[G3708]] I am [[G1510]] a fellow servant [[G4889]] with you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] brothers [[G80]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] with those who [[G3588]] keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of this [[G3778]] book. [[G975]] Worship [[G4352]] God! [[G2316]] 
10 Then [[G2532]] he told [[G3004]] me, [[G1473]] “Do not seal up [[G4972]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] prophecy [[G4394]] in this [[G3778]] book, [[G975]] because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] is [[G1510]] near. [[G1451]] 
11 {Let} the [[G3588]] unrighteous [[G91]] continue to be unrighteous, [[G91]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] vile [[G4508]] continue to be vile; [[G4510]] {let} [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] continue to practice [[G4160]] righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] continue to be holy.” [[G37]] 
12 “Behold, [[G2400]] I am coming [[G2064]] quickly, [[G5035]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] reward [[G3408]] [is] with [[G3326]] Me, [[G1473]] to give [[G591]] to each one [[G1538]] according to [[G5613]] what [[G3588]] he [[G846]] has done. [[G2041]] 
13 I [am] [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] Alpha [[G1]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Omega, [[G5598]] the [[G3588]] First [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Last, [[G2078]] the [[G3588]] Beginning [[G746]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] End.” [[G5056]] 
14 Blessed [are] [[G3107]] those who [[G3588]] wash [[G4150]] their [[G846]] robes, [[G4749]] so that [[G2443]] they [[G846]] may have [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] right [[G1849]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G3586]] of life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] may enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] by [its] [[G3588]] gates. [[G4440]] 
15 [But] outside [are] [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] dogs, [[G2965]] the [[G3588]] sorcerers, [[G5333]] the [[G3588]] sexually immoral, [[G4205]] the [[G3588]] murderers, [[G5406]] the [[G3588]] idolaters, [[G1496]] and [[G2532]] everyone who [[G3956]] loves [[G5368]] and [[G2532]] practices [[G4160]] falsehood. [[G5579]] 
16 “I, [[G1473]] Jesus, [[G2424]] have sent [[G3992]] My [[G1473]] angel [[G32]] to give you this testimony [[G3140]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Root [[G4491]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Offspring [[G1085]] of David, [[G1138]] the [[G3588]] bright [[G2986]] Morning [[G4407]] Star. [[G792]] 
17 The [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] bride [[G3565]] say, [[G3004]] “Come!” [[G2064]] {Let} the [one who] [[G3588]] hears [[G191]] say, [[G2036]] “Come!” [[G2064]] And [[G2532]] {let} the [one who] [[G3588]] is thirsty [[G1372]] come, [[G2064]] [and] the [one who] [[G3588]] desires [[G2309]] [the] water [[G5204]] of life [[G2222]] [drink] [[G2983]] freely. [[G1432]] 
18 I [[G1473]] testify [[G3140]] to everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] hears [[G191]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] prophecy [[G4394]] in this [[G3778]] book: [[G975]] If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] adds [[G2007]] to [[G1909]] [them], [[G846]] God [[G2316]] will add [[G2007]] to [[G1909]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] plagues [[G4127]] described [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] book. [[G975]] 
19 And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] takes away [[G851]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of this [[G3778]] book [[G975]] of prophecy, [[G4394]] God [[G2316]] will take away [[G851]] his [[G846]] share [[G3313]] in [[G575]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G3586]] of life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] city, [[G4172]] which [are] [[G3588]] described [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] book. [[G975]] 
20 He who [[G3588]] testifies to [[G3140]] these things [[G3778]] says, [[G3004]] “Yes, [[G3483]] I am coming [[G2064]] soon.” [[G5035]] Amen. [[G281]] Come, [[G2064]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus! [[G2424]] 
21 The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] [be] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] the saints. [[G40]] Amen. [[G281]]
