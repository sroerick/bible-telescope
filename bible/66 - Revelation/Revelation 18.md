# Revelation 18
[[Revelation 17|←]] • [[Revelation 19|→]]
1 After [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] I saw [[G3708]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] descending [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] with [[G2192]] great [[G3173]] authority, [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] was illuminated [[G5461]] by [[G1537]] his [[G846]] glory. [[G1391]] 
2 And [[G2532]] he cried out [[G2896]] in [[G1722]] a mighty [[G2478]] voice: [[G5456]] “Fallen, [[G4098]] fallen is [[G4098]] Babylon [[G897]] the [[G3588]] great! [[G3173]] She has become [[G1096]] a lair [[G2732]] for demons [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] a haunt [[G5438]] for every [[G3956]] unclean [[G169]] spirit, [[G4151]] every [[G3956]] unclean [[G169]] bird, [[G3732]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] detestable [[G3404]] beast. [[G2342]] 
3 All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] have drunk [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] of the [[G3588]] passion [[G2372]] of [[G3588]] her [[G846]] immorality. [[G4202]] The [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] were immoral [[G4203]] with [[G3326]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] merchants [[G1713]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] have grown wealthy [[G4147]] through [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] extravagance [[G1411]] of [[G3588]] her [[G846]] luxury. [[G4764]] 
4 Then [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] another [[G243]] voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] say: [[G3004]] “Come [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] her, [[G846]] my [[G1473]] people, [[G2992]] so that [[G2443]] you will not share [[G4790]] in [[G3588]] her [[G846]] sins [[G266]] [or] [[G2532]] contract [[G2983]] [any] of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] plagues. [[G4127]] 
5 For [[G3754]] her [[G846]] sins [[G266]] are piled [[G2853]] up to [[G891]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] has remembered [[G3421]] her [[G846]] iniquities. [[G92]] 
6 Give back [[G591]] to her [[G846]] as [[G5613]] she [[G846]] has done [to others]; [[G591]] pay her back [[G1363]] double [[G1362]] for what [[G2596]] she [[G846]] has done; [[G2041]] mix [[G2767]] her [[G846]] a double [portion] [[G1362]] in [[G1722]] [her own] [[G3588]] cup. [[G4221]] 
7 As much as [[G3745]] she has glorified [[G1392]] herself [[G848]] and [[G2532]] lived in luxury, [[G4763]] give [[G1325]] her [[G846]] the same measure [[G5118]] of torment [[G929]] and [[G2532]] grief. [[G3997]] In [[G1722]] her [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] she says, [[G3004]] ‘I sit [[G2521]] [as] queen; [[G938]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] a widow [[G5503]] and [[G2532]] {will} never [[G3756]] see [[G3708]] grief. [[G3997]] 
8 Therefore [[G1223]] her [[G846]] plagues [[G4127]] will come [[G2240]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] day— [[G2250]] death [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] misery [[G3997]] and [[G2532]] famine— [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] she will be consumed [[G2618]] by [[G1722]] fire, [[G4442]] for [[G3754]] mighty [is the] [[G2478]] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] judges [[G2919]] her. [[G846]] 
9 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] who [[G3588]] committed sexual immorality [[G4203]] and [[G2532]] lived in luxury [[G4763]] with [[G3326]] her [[G846]] will weep [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] wail [[G2875]] at [[G1909]] the sight of [[G991]] the [[G3588]] smoke [ rising ] [[G2586]] from [[G3588]] the fire that consumes [[G4451]] her. [[G846]] 
10 In [[G1223]] fear [[G5401]] of [[G3588]] her [[G846]] torment, [[G929]] they will stand [[G2476]] at [[G575]] a distance [[G3113]] [and] cry out: [[G3004]] “Woe, [[G3759]] woe [[G3759]] to the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] city, [[G4172]] the [[G3588]] mighty [[G2478]] city [[G4172]] of Babylon! [[G897]] For [in] [[G3754]] a single [[G1520]] hour [[G5610]] your [[G4771]] judgment [[G2920]] has come. [[G2064]] 
11 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] merchants [[G1713]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] will weep [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] mourn [[G3996]] over [[G1909]] her, [[G846]] because [there is] [[G3754]] no one [[G3762]] left [[G3765]] to buy [[G59]] their [[G846]] cargo— [[G1117]] 
12 cargo [[G1117]] of gold, [[G5557]] silver, [[G696]] precious [[G5093]] stones, [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] pearls; [[G3135]] [of] [[G2532]] fine linen, [[G1039]] purple, [[G4209]] silk, [[G4596]] and [[G2532]] scarlet; [[G2847]] of all kinds [[G3956]] of citron [[G2367]] wood [[G3586]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] article [[G4632]] of ivory [[G1661]] and [[G2532]] precious [[G5093]] wood, [[G3586]] of bronze, [[G5475]] iron, [[G4604]] and [[G2532]] marble; [[G3139]] 
13 of cinnamon, [[G2792]] spice, [[G299]] incense, [[G2368]] myrrh, [[G3464]] and [[G2532]] frankincense; [[G3030]] of wine, [[G3631]] olive oil, [[G1637]] fine flour, [[G4585]] and [[G2532]] wheat; [[G4621]] of cattle, [[G2934]] sheep, [[G4263]] horses, [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] chariots; [[G4480]] of slaves [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] souls [[G5590]] of men. [[G444]] 
14 “The [[G3588]] fruit [[G3703]] of your [[G4771]] soul’s [[G5590]] desire [[G1939]] has departed [[G565]] from [[G575]] you; [[G4771]] all [[G3956]] [your] [[G3588]] luxury [[G3045]] and [[G2532]] splendor [[G2986]] have vanished, [[G622]] never to be [seen] [[G2147]] [again].” [[G3765]] 
15 The [[G3588]] merchants [[G1713]] who sold these things [[G3778]] [and] grew their wealth [[G4147]] from [[G575]] her [[G846]] will stand [[G2476]] at [[G575]] a distance, [[G3113]] in [[G1223]] fear [[G5401]] of [[G3588]] her [[G846]] torment. [[G929]] They will weep [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] mourn, [[G3996]] 
16 saying: [[G3004]] “Woe, [[G3759]] woe [[G3759]] to the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] city, [[G4172]] clothed in [[G4016]] fine linen [[G1039]] and [[G2532]] purple [[G4210]] and [[G2532]] scarlet, [[G2847]] adorned [[G5558]] with [[G1722]] gold [[G5553]] and [[G2532]] precious [[G5093]] stones [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] pearls! [[G3135]] 
17 For [in] [[G3754]] a single [[G1520]] hour [[G5610]] such fabulous [[G5118]] wealth [[G4149]] has been destroyed!” [[G2049]] Every [[G3956]] shipmaster, [[G2942]] passenger, [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] sailor, [[G3492]] and [[G2532]] all who [[G3745]] make their living [[G2038]] from the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] will stand [[G2476]] at [[G575]] a distance [[G3113]] 
18 and [[G2532]] cry out [[G2896]] at the sight [[G991]] of the [[G3588]] smoke [rising] [[G2586]] from [[G3588]] the fire that consumes [[G4451]] her, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] ‘What [city was ever] [[G5101]] like [[G3664]] [this] [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] city?’ [[G4172]] 
19 Then [[G2532]] they will throw [[G906]] dust [[G5522]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] heads [[G2776]] as they weep [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] mourn [[G3996]] and [[G2532]] cry out: [[G2896]] “Woe, [[G3759]] woe [[G3759]] to the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] city, [[G4172]] [where] [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] ships [[G4143]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] were enriched [[G4147]] by [[G1537]] her [[G846]] wealth! [[G5094]] For [[G3754]] in a single [[G1520]] hour [[G5610]] she has been destroyed. [[G2049]] 
20 “Rejoice [[G2165]] over [[G1909]] her, [[G846]] O heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] [you] saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] prophets; [[G4396]] because [[G3754]] [it is] for you [[G4771]] [that] God [[G2316]] has pronounced [[G2919]] [His] judgment [[G2917]] against [[G1537]] her.” [[G846]] 
21 Then [[G2532]] a [[G1520]] mighty [[G2478]] angel [[G32]] picked up [[G142]] a stone [[G3037]] the size of [[G5613]] a great [[G3173]] millstone [[G3458]] and [[G2532]] cast [it] [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] saying: [[G3004]] “With such [[G3779]] violence [[G3731]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] city [[G4172]] of Babylon [[G897]] will be cast down, [[G906]] never to be [seen] [[G2147]] again. [[G2089]] 
22 And [[G2532]] [the] sound [[G5456]] of harpists [[G2790]] and [[G2532]] musicians, [[G3451]] of flute players [[G834]] and [[G2532]] trumpeters, [[G4538]] will never ring out [[G191]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] again. [[G2089]] [Nor will] [[G2532]] any [[G3956]] craftsmen [[G5079]] of any [[G3956]] trade [[G5078]] be [found] [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] again, [[G2089]] [nor] [[G2532]] [the] sound [[G5456]] of a millstone [[G3458]] be heard [[G191]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] again. [[G2089]] 
23 [The] light [[G5457]] of a lamp [[G3088]] will never shine [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] again, [[G2089]] and [[G2532]] [the] voices [[G5456]] of a bride [[G3565]] and [[G2532]] bridegroom [[G3566]] will never call out [[G191]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] again. [[G2089]] For [[G3754]] your [[G4771]] merchants [[G1713]] were [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] great ones [[G3175]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] because [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] were deceived [[G4105]] by [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] sorcery. [[G5331]] 
24 And [[G2532]] there was found [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] [the] blood [[G129]] of prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] saints, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] of all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] had been slain [[G4969]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]
