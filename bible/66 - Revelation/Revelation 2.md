[[Revelation 1|←]] • [[Revelation 3|→]]
1 To the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Ephesus [[G2181]] write: [[G1125]] These [are] [[G3592]] the words [[G3004]] of Him who [[G3588]] holds [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] stars [[G792]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] right hand [[G1188]] [and] walks [[G4043]] among [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] golden [[G5552]] lampstands. [[G3087]] 
2 I know [[G1492]] your [[G4771]] deeds, [[G2041]] your [[G4771]] labor, [[G2873]] and [[G2532]] [your] [[G3588]] perseverance. [[G5281]] [I know] [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] you cannot [[G1410]] tolerate [[G941]] [those who are] evil, [[G2556]] and [[G2532]] you have tested [[G3985]] and [[G2532]] exposed [[G2147]] as liars [[G5571]] those who [[G3588]] falsely [[G3756]] claim [[G3004]] to be [[G1438]] apostles. [[G652]] 
3 Without [[G2532]] growing weary, [[G2872]] you have [[G2192]] persevered [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] endured many things [[G941]] for the sake of [[G1223]] My [[G1473]] name. [[G3686]] 
4 But [[G235]] I have [[G2192]] this [[G3754]] against [[G2596]] you: [[G4771]] You have abandoned [[G863]] your [[G4771]] first [[G4413]] love. [[G26]] 
5 Therefore, [[G3767]] keep in mind [[G3421]] how far [[G4159]] you have fallen. [[G4098]] Repent [[G3340]] and [[G2532]] perform [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] deeds [you did] [[G2041]] at first. [[G4413]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you do not repent, [[G3340]] I will come [[G2064]] to you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] remove [[G2795]] your [[G4771]] lampstand [[G3087]] from [[G1537]] its [[G846]] place. [[G5117]] 
6 But [[G235]] you have [[G2192]] this [[G3778]] [to your credit]: [[G3754]] You hate [[G3404]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of the [[G3588]] Nicolaitans, [[G3531]] which [[G3739]] I also [[G2504]] hate. [[G3404]] 
7 He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] says [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]] To the [one who] [[G3588]] is victorious, [[G3528]] I will grant [the right] [[G1325]] to eat [[G5315]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G3586]] of life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] paradise [[G3857]] of God. [[G2316]] 
8 To the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of [[G3588]] the church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Smyrna [[G4667]] write: [[G1125]] These [are] [[G3592]] the words [[G3004]] of the [[G3588]] First [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Last, [[G2078]] who [[G3739]] died [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] returned to life. [[G2198]] 
9 I know [[G1492]] your [[G4771]] affliction [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] [your] [[G3588]] poverty— [[G4432]] though [[G235]] you are [[G1510]] rich! [[G4145]] And [I am aware of] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] slander [[G988]] of [[G1537]] those who [[G3588]] falsely [[G3756]] claim [[G3004]] to be [[G1510]] Jews, [[G2453]] but [are in fact] [[G235]] a synagogue [[G4864]] of Satan. [[G4567]] 
10 {Do} not [[G3367]] fear [[G5399]] what [[G3739]] you are about [[G3195]] to suffer. [[G3958]] Look, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] is about [[G3195]] to throw [[G906]] [some] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1519]] prison [[G5438]] to [[G2443]] test you, [[G3985]] and [[G2532]] you will suffer [[G2192]] tribulation [[G2347]] [for] ten [[G1176]] days. [[G2250]] Be [[G1096]] faithful [[G4103]] [even] unto [[G891]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] I will give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] crown [[G4735]] of life. [[G2222]] 
11 He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] says [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]] The [one who] [[G3588]] is victorious [[G3528]] will not be harmed [[G91]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] death. [[G2288]] 
12 To the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Pergamum [[G4010]] write: [[G1125]] These [are] [[G3592]] the words [[G3004]] of the [One who] [[G3588]] holds [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] sharp, [[G3691]] double-edged [[G1366]] sword. [[G4501]] 
13 I know [[G1492]] where [[G4226]] you live, [[G2730]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of Satan [sits]. [[G4567]] Yet [[G2532]] you have held fast [[G2902]] to My [[G1473]] name [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] have not denied [[G720]] [your] [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] in Me, [[G1473]] even [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] [when] My [[G1473]] faithful [[G4103]] witness [[G3144]] Antipas [[G493]] was killed [[G615]] among [[G3844]] you, [[G4771]] where [[G3699]] Satan [[G4567]] dwells. [[G2730]] 
14 But [[G235]] I have [[G2192]] a few things [[G3641]] against [[G2596]] you, [[G4771]] because [[G3754]] [some] [[G1563]] of you [[G2192]] hold [[G2902]] to the [[G3588]] teaching [[G1322]] of Balaam, [[G903]] who [[G3739]] taught [[G1321]] Balak [[G904]] to place [[G906]] a stumbling block [[G4625]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Israelites [[G2474]] so they would eat [[G5315]] food sacrificed to idols [[G1494]] and [[G2532]] commit sexual immorality. [[G4203]] 
15 In the same way, [[G3668]] [some of] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] hold [[G2902]] to the [[G3588]] teaching [[G1322]] of the [[G3588]] Nicolaitans. [[G3531]] 
16 Therefore [[G3767]] repent! [[G3340]] Otherwise [[G1161]] I will come [[G2064]] to you [[G4771]] shortly [[G5035]] and [[G2532]] wage war [[G4170]] against [[G3326]] them [[G846]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sword [[G4501]] of My [[G1473]] mouth. [[G4750]] 
17 He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] says [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]] To [the one] [[G846]] who [[G3588]] is victorious, [[G3528]] I will give [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] hidden [[G2928]] manna. [[G3131]] I will also give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] a white [[G3022]] stone [[G5586]] inscribed [[G1125]] [with] [[G2532]] a new [[G2537]] name, [[G3686]] known [[G1492]] only [[G1487]] to the [one who] [[G3588]] receives [it]. [[G2983]] 
18 To [[G3588]] [the] angel [[G32]] of the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Thyatira [[G2363]] write: [[G1125]] These [are] [[G3592]] the words [[G3004]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] whose [[G2192]] eyes [are] [[G3788]] like [[G5613]] a blazing [[G5395]] fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] [whose] [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] [are] like [[G3664]] polished bronze. [[G5474]] 
19 I know [[G1492]] your [[G4771]] deeds— [[G2041]] your [[G4771]] love, [[G26]] [your] [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] [your] [[G3588]] service, [[G1248]] [your] [[G3588]] perseverance— [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] latter [[G2078]] deeds [[G2041]] [are] greater [[G4119]] than [your] [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]] 
20 But [[G235]] I have [this] [[G2192]] against [[G2596]] you: [[G4771]] You tolerate [[G863]] that [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] Jezebel, [[G2403]] who [[G3588]] calls [[G3004]] herself [[G1438]] a prophetess. [[G4398]] By her teaching [[G1321]] she misleads [[G4105]] My [[G1699]] servants [[G1401]] to be sexually immoral [[G4203]] and [[G2532]] to eat [[G5315]] food sacrificed to idols. [[G1494]] 
21 Even [though] [[G2532]] I have given [[G1325]] her [[G846]] time [[G5550]] to [[G2443]] repent [[G3340]] of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] immorality, [[G4202]] she is unwilling. [[G2309]] 
22 Behold, [[G2400]] I will cast [[G906]] her [[G846]] onto [[G1519]] a bed of sickness, [[G2825]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] commit adultery [[G3431]] with [[G3326]] her [[G846]] [will suffer] [[G1519]] great [[G3173]] tribulation [[G2347]] unless [[G1437]] they repent [[G3340]] of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] deeds. [[G2041]] 
23 Then [[G2532]] I will strike [[G615]] her [[G846]] children [[G5043]] dead, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] will know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [One who] [[G3588]] searches [[G2045]] minds [[G3510]] and [[G2532]] hearts, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] I will repay [[G1325]] each [[G1538]] of you [[G4771]] according to [[G2596]] your [[G4771]] deeds. [[G2041]] 
24 But [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] to [the] [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] of you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] Thyatira, [[G2363]] who [[G3745]] {do} not [[G3756]] hold to [[G2192]] [her] [[G3778]] teaching [[G1322]] [and] [[G3748]] {have} not [[G3756]] learned [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] so-called [[G3004]] deep things [[G901]] of Satan: [[G4567]] I will place [[G906]] no [[G3756]] further [[G243]] burden [[G922]] upon [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]] 
25 Nevertheless, [[G4133]] hold fast [[G2902]] to what [[G3739]] you have [[G2192]] until [[G891]] I come. [[G2240]] 
26 And [[G2532]] to the [one who] [[G3588]] is victorious [[G3528]] and [[G2532]] continues [[G5083]] {in} My [[G1473]] work [[G2041]] until [[G891]] [the] end, [[G5056]] I will give [[G1325]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] nations. [[G1484]] 
27 He will rule [[G4165]] them [[G846]] with [[G1722]] an iron [[G4603]] scepter [[G4464]] [and] shatter [them] [[G4937]] like [[G5613]] pottery— [[G2764]] just as [[G5613]] I [[G2504]] have received [authority] [[G2983]] from [[G3844]] My [[G1473]] Father. [[G3962]] 
28 And [[G2532]] I will give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] morning [[G4407]] star. [[G792]] 
29 He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] says [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]]
