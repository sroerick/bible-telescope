[[Revelation 3|←]] • [[Revelation 5|→]]
1 After [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] I looked [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2400]] a door [[G2374]] standing open [[G455]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] I had previously heard [[G191]] speak [[G2980]] to [[G3326]] me [[G1473]] like [[G5613]] a trumpet [[G4536]] was saying, [[G3004]] “Come up [[G305]] here, [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] I will show [[G1166]] you [[G4771]] what [[G3739]] must [[G1163]] happen [[G1096]] after [[G3326]] these things. [[G3778]] 
2 At once [[G2112]] I was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] I saw [[G2400]] a throne [[G2362]] standing [[G2749]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] [with] [[G2532]] [someone] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] [it]. [[G2362]] 
3 The [One] [[G3588]] seated there [[G2521]] looked [[G3706]] like [[G3664]] jasper [[G2393]] and [[G2532]] ruby, [[G4556]] and [[G2532]] a rainbow [[G2463]] that gleamed [[G3706]] like [[G3664]] an emerald [[G4664]] encircled [[G2943]] the [[G3588]] throne. [[G2362]] 
4 Surrounding [[G2943]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] [were] twenty-four [[G1501]] other thrones, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] these [[G3588]] thrones [[G2362]] sat [[G2521]] twenty-four [[G1501]] elders [[G4245]] dressed [[G4016]] in [[G1722]] white, [[G3022]] [with] [[G2532]] golden [[G5552]] crowns [[G4735]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] heads. [[G2776]] 
5 From [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] came [[G1607]] flashes of lightning, [[G796]] and [[G2532]] rumblings, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] peals of thunder. [[G1027]] Before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] burned [[G2545]] seven [[G2033]] torches [[G2985]] of fire. [[G4442]] This [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] sevenfold [[G2033]] Spirit [[G4151]] of God. [[G2316]] 
6 And [[G2532]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] [was something] like [[G5613]] a sea [[G2281]] of glass, [[G5193]] [as clear as] [[G3664]] crystal. [[G2930]] In [[G1722]] [the] center, [[G3319]] around [[G2945]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] [were] four [[G5064]] living creatures, [[G2226]] covered with [[G1073]] eyes [[G3788]] in front [[G1715]] and [[G2532]] back. [[G3693]] 
7 The [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] living creature [[G2226]] [was] like [[G3664]] a lion, [[G3023]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] like [[G3664]] a calf, [[G3448]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] had [[G2192]] a face [[G4383]] like [[G5613]] a man, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fourth [[G5067]] [was] like [[G3664]] an eagle [[G105]] in flight. [[G4072]] 
8 And [[G2532]] each [[G1520]] [of] [[G846]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures [[G2226]] had [[G2192]] six [[G1803]] wings [[G4420]] [and was] covered with [[G1073]] eyes [[G3788]] all around [[G2943]] and [[G2532]] within. [[G2081]] Day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night [[G3571]] they never [[G2192]] stop [[G372]] saying: [[G3004]] “Holy, [[G40]] Holy, [[G40]] Holy, [[G40]] [is the] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty, [[G3841]] who [[G3588]] was [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] is [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] is to come! [[G2064]] 
9 And [[G2532]] whenever [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] living creatures [[G2226]] give [[G1325]] glory, [[G1391]] honor, [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] thanks [[G2169]] to the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] who [[G3588]] lives [[G2198]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever, [[G165]] 
10 the [[G3588]] twenty-four [[G1501]] elders [[G4245]] fall down [[G4098]] before [[G1799]] the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] they worship [[G4352]] Him who [[G3588]] lives [[G2198]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] They cast [[G906]] their [[G846]] crowns [[G4735]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] saying: [[G3004]] 
11 “You are [[G1510]] worthy, [[G514]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] God, [[G2316]] to receive [[G2983]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honor [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] power, [[G1411]] for [[G3754]] You [[G4771]] created [[G2936]] all things; [[G3956]] by [[G1223]] Your [[G4771]] will [[G2307]] they exist, [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] came to be. [[G2936]]
