# Revelation 8
[[Revelation 7|←]] • [[Revelation 9|→]]
1 When [[G3752]] [the Lamb] opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] seal, [[G4973]] there was [[G1096]] silence [[G4602]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] for about [[G5613]] half an hour. [[G2256]] 
2 And [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] who [[G3739]] stand [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] were given [[G1325]] seven [[G2033]] trumpets. [[G4536]] 
3 Then [[G2532]] another [[G243]] angel, [[G32]] who had [[G2192]] a golden [[G5552]] censer, [[G3031]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] stood [[G2476]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] altar. [[G2379]] He [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] much [[G4183]] incense [[G2368]] to [[G2443]] offer, [[G1325]] along with the [[G3588]] prayers [[G4335]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] golden [[G5552]] altar [[G2379]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne. [[G2362]] 
4 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] smoke [[G2586]] of the [[G3588]] incense, [[G2368]] together with the [[G3588]] prayers [[G4335]] of the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] rose up [[G305]] before [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] from [[G1537]] [the] hand [[G5495]] of the [[G3588]] angel. [[G32]] 
5 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] censer, [[G3031]] filled [[G1072]] it [[G846]] with [[G1537]] fire [[G4442]] from the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] and [[G2532]] hurled [it] [[G906]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth; [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] there were [[G1096]] peals of thunder, [[G1027]] and [[G2532]] rumblings, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] flashes of lightning, [[G796]] and [[G2532]] an earthquake. [[G4578]] 
6 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] with [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] trumpets [[G4536]] prepared [[G2090]] to [[G2443]] sound [them]. [[G4537]] 
7 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [angel] [[G4413]] sounded [his] trumpet, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] hail [[G5464]] and [[G2532]] fire [[G4442]] mixed [[G3396]] with [[G1722]] blood [[G129]] were flung [[G906]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] A [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of [[G3588]] the earth [[G1093]] was burned up, [[G2618]] along with [[G2532]] a [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of the [[G3588]] trees [[G1186]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] [the] green [[G5515]] grass. [[G5528]] 
8 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] angel [[G32]] sounded [his] trumpet, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] [something] like [[G5613]] a great [[G3173]] mountain [[G3735]] burning [[G2545]] with fire [[G4442]] was thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]] A [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] turned to [[G1096]] blood, [[G129]] 
9 a [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of the [[G3588]] living [[G5590]] creatures [[G2938]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] died, [[G599]] and [[G2532]] a [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of the [[G3588]] ships [[G4143]] were destroyed. [[G1311]] 
10 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] angel [[G32]] sounded [his] trumpet, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] a great [[G3173]] star [[G792]] burning [[G2545]] like [[G5613]] a torch [[G2985]] fell [[G4098]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] [landed] [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of the [[G3588]] rivers [[G4215]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] springs [[G4077]] of [[G3588]] water. [[G5204]] 
11 The [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] star [[G792]] [is] [[G3004]] Wormwood. [[G894]] A [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of the [[G3588]] waters [[G5204]] turned [[G1096]] [bitter] like wormwood oil, [[G894]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] people [[G444]] died [[G599]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] bitter [[G4087]] waters. [[G5204]] 
12 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fourth [[G5067]] angel [[G32]] sounded [his] trumpet, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] a [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] moon [[G4582]] and [[G2532]] stars [[G792]] were struck. [[G4141]] A [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of [the stars] [[G846]] were darkened, [[G4654]] a [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of [[G846]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] was without light, [[G5316]] and [[G2532]] [a third of] the [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] as well. [[G3668]] 
13 And [[G2532]] as I observed, [[G3708]] I heard [[G191]] an [[G1520]] eagle [[G105]] flying [[G4072]] overhead, [[G3321]] calling [[G3004]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] “Woe! [[G3759]] Woe! [[G3759]] Woe [[G3759]] to those who [[G3588]] dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] because of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] trumpet [[G4536]] blasts [[G5456]] about [[G3195]] to be sounded [[G4537]] by the [[G3588]] remaining [[G3062]] three [[G5140]] angels!
