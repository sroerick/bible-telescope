# Revelation 15
[[Revelation 14|←]] • [[Revelation 16|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] another [[G243]] great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] marvelous [[G2298]] sign [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] with [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] final [[G2078]] plagues, [[G4127]] with [[G1722]] [which] [[G846]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G2372]] of God [[G2316]] will be completed. [[G5055]] 
2 And [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] [something] like [[G5613]] a sea [[G2281]] of glass [[G5193]] mixed [[G3396]] with fire, [[G4442]] beside [[G1909]] [which] [[G5193]] stood [[G2476]] those who [[G3588]] had conquered [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] image [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of its [[G846]] name. [[G3686]] They were holding [[G2192]] harps [[G2788]] from God, [[G2316]] 
3 and [[G2532]] they sang [[G103]] the [[G3588]] song [[G5603]] of [[G3588]] God’s [[G2316]] servant [[G1401]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb: [[G721]] “Great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] wonderful [are] [[G2298]] Your [[G4771]] works, [[G2041]] O Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty! [[G3841]] Just [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] true [are] [[G228]] Your [[G4771]] ways, [[G3598]] O [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] nations! [[G1484]] 
4 Who [[G5101]] will not fear [You], [[G5399]] O Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] glorify [[G1392]] Your [[G4771]] name? [[G3686]] For [You] [[G3754]] alone [are] [[G3441]] holy. [[G3741]] All [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] will come [[G2240]] and [[G2532]] worship [[G4352]] before [[G1799]] You, [[G4771]] for [[G3754]] Your [[G4771]] righteous acts [[G1345]] have been revealed. [[G5319]] 
5 After [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] I looked, [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] temple— [[G3485]] the [[G3588]] Tabernacle [[G4633]] of the [[G3588]] Testimony— [[G3142]] was opened [[G455]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
6 And [[G2532]] out [[G1537]] of the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] came [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] with [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] plagues, [[G4127]] dressed in [[G1746]] clean [[G2513]] [and] bright [[G2986]] linen [[G3043]] and [[G2532]] girded with [[G4024]] golden [[G5552]] sashes [[G2223]] around [[G4012]] [their] [[G3588]] chests. [[G4738]] 
7 Then [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures [[G2226]] gave [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] seven [[G2033]] golden [[G5552]] bowls [[G5357]] full [[G1073]] of the [[G3588]] wrath [[G2372]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] lives [[G2198]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] 
8 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] was filled [[G1072]] with smoke [[G2586]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] His [[G846]] power; [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] could [[G1410]] enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] until [[G891]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] plagues [[G4127]] of the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] were completed.
