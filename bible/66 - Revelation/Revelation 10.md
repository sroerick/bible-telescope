[[Revelation 9|←]] • [[Revelation 11|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] another [[G243]] mighty [[G2478]] angel [[G32]] coming down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] wrapped in [[G4016]] a cloud, [[G3507]] [with] [[G2532]] a [[G3588]] rainbow [[G2463]] above [[G1909]] his [[G846]] head. [[G2776]] His [[G846]] face [[G4383]] [was] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sun, [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] legs [[G4228]] like [[G5613]] pillars [[G4769]] of fire. [[G4442]] 
2 He held [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] a small scroll, [[G974]] which lay open. [[G455]] He placed [[G5087]] his [[G846]] right [[G1188]] foot [[G4228]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G1161]] [his] [[G3588]] left [foot] [[G2176]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land. [[G1093]] 
3 Then [[G2532]] he cried out [[G2896]] in a loud voice [[G5456]] like [[G5618]] the roar [[G3455]] of a lion. [[G3023]] And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he cried out, [[G2896]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] thunders [[G1027]] sounded [[G2980]] their [[G1438]] voices. [[G5456]] 
4 When [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] thunders [[G1027]] had spoken, [[G2980]] I was about [[G3195]] to put it in writing. [[G1125]] But [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] saying, [[G3004]] “Seal up [[G4972]] what [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] thunders [[G1027]] have said, [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] write [[G1125]] it {down}. [[G846]] 
5 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] I had seen [[G3708]] standing [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] lifted up [[G142]] his [[G846]] right [[G1188]] hand [[G5495]] to [[G1519]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
6 And [[G2532]] he swore [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] Him who [[G3588]] lives [[G2198]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever, [[G165]] who [[G3739]] created [[G2936]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] [everything] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] it, [[G846]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] [everything] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] [everything] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] it: [[G846]] There will be [[G1510]] no more [[G3765]] delay! [[G5550]] 
7 But [[G235]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] of the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] angel, [[G32]] when [[G3752]] he is about [[G3195]] to sound [his] trumpet, [[G4537]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of God [[G2316]] will be fulfilled, [[G5055]] just as [[G5613]] He proclaimed [[G2097]] to His [[G1438]] servants, [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]] 
8 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] that [[G3739]] I had heard [[G191]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] spoke [[G2980]] to [[G3326]] me [[G1473]] again, [[G3825]] saying, [[G3004]] “Go, [[G5217]] take [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] small scroll [[G975]] that [[G3588]] lies open [[G455]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] of the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] standing [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land. [[G1093]] 
9 And [[G2532]] I went [[G565]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Give [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] small scroll.” [[G974]] “Take [it] [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] eat [[G2719]] it,” [[G846]] he said. [[G3004]] “It will make [[G4087]] your [[G4771]] stomach {bitter}, [[G2836]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] mouth [[G4750]] it will be [[G1510]] sweet [[G1099]] as [[G5613]] honey.” [[G3192]] 
10 [So] [[G2532]] I took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] small scroll [[G974]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] angel’s [[G32]] hand [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] ate [[G2719]] it; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] it was [[G1510]] sweet [[G1099]] as [[G5613]] honey [[G3192]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] mouth, [[G4750]] [but] [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] I had eaten [[G5315]] it, [[G846]] my [[G1473]] stomach [[G2836]] turned bitter. [[G4087]] 
11 And [[G2532]] they told [[G3004]] me, [[G1473]] “You [[G4771]] must [[G1163]] prophesy [[G4395]] again [[G3825]] about [[G1909]] many [[G4183]] peoples [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] nations [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] tongues [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] kings.” [[G935]]
