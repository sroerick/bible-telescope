# Revelation 21
[[Revelation 20|←]] • [[Revelation 22|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] a new [[G2537]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] a new [[G2537]] earth, [[G1093]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] had passed away, [[G565]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] was [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] more. [[G2089]] 
2 I saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] city, [[G4172]] [the] new [[G2537]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] coming down [[G2597]] out of [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] from [[G575]] God, [[G2316]] prepared [[G2090]] as [[G5613]] a bride [[G3565]] adorned [[G2885]] for [[G3588]] her [[G846]] husband. [[G435]] 
3 And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] saying: [[G3004]] “Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] dwelling place [[G4633]] of God [[G2316]] [is] with [[G3326]] man, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] He will live [[G4637]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]] They [[G846]] will be [[G1510]] His [[G846]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] Himself [[G846]] will be [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] them [[G846]] [as] their [[G846]] God. [[G2316]] 
4 He will wipe away [[G1813]] every [[G3956]] tear [[G1144]] from [[G1537]] their [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] there will be [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] more [[G2089]] death [[G2288]] [or] [[G3777]] mourning [[G3997]] [or] [[G3777]] crying [[G2906]] [or] [[G3777]] pain, [[G4192]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] former things [[G4413]] have passed away. [[G565]] 
5 And [[G2532]] the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] said, [[G2036]] “Behold, [[G2400]] I make [[G4160]] all things [[G3956]] new.” [[G2537]] Then [[G2532]] He said, [[G3004]] “Write this down, [[G1125]] for [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] words [[G3056]] are [[G1510]] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] true.” [[G228]] 
6 And [[G2532]] He told [[G2036]] me, [[G1473]] “It is done! [[G1096]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Alpha [[G1]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Omega, [[G5598]] the [[G3588]] Beginning [[G746]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] End. [[G5056]] To the [[G3588]] thirsty [[G1372]] I [[G1473]] will give [[G1325]] freely [[G1432]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] spring [[G4077]] of the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] of life. [[G2222]] 
7 The [one who] [[G3588]] is victorious [[G3528]] will inherit [[G2816]] all things, [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] I will be [[G1510]] his [[G846]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] will be [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] son. [[G5207]] 
8 But [[G1161]] to [the] cowardly [[G1169]] and [[G2532]] unbelieving [[G571]] and [[G2532]] abominable [[G948]] and [[G2532]] murderers [[G5406]] and [[G2532]] sexually immoral [[G4205]] and [[G2532]] sorcerers [[G5333]] and [[G2532]] idolaters [[G1496]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] liars, [[G5571]] their [[G846]] place [[G3313]] [will be] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] that [[G3588]] burns [[G2545]] with fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] sulfur. [[G2303]] This [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] death. [[G2288]] 
9 Then [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] with [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] bowls [[G5357]] full [[G1073]] of the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] last [[G2078]] plagues [[G4127]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2980]] to [[G3326]] me, [[G1473]] “Come, [[G1204]] I will show [[G1166]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] bride, [[G3565]] the [[G3588]] wife [[G1135]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb. [[G721]] 
10 And [[G2532]] he carried me away [[G667]] in [[G1722]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] to [[G1909]] a mountain [[G3735]] great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] high, [[G5308]] and [[G2532]] showed [[G1166]] me [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] city [[G4172]] [of] Jerusalem [[G2419]] coming down [[G2597]] out of [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] from [[G575]] God, [[G2316]] 
11 shining with [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of God. [[G2316]] Its [[G846]] radiance [[G5458]] [was] like [[G3664]] a most precious [[G5093]] jewel, [[G3037]] like [[G5613]] a jasper [[G2393]] stone, [[G3037]] clear as crystal. [[G2929]] 
12 [The city] had [[G2192]] a great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] high [[G5308]] wall [[G5038]] with [[G2192]] twelve [[G1427]] gates [[G4440]] inscribed [[G1924]] with the [[G3588]] names [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] tribes [[G5443]] of Israel, [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] twelve [[G1427]] angels [[G32]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] gates. [[G4440]] 
13 [There were] three [[G5140]] gates [[G4440]] on [[G575]] [the] east, [[G395]] three [[G5140]] on [[G575]] [the] north, [[G1005]] three [[G5140]] on [[G575]] [the] south, [[G3558]] and [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] on [[G575]] [the] west. [[G1424]] 
14 The [[G3588]] wall [[G5038]] of the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] had [[G2192]] twelve [[G1427]] foundations [[G2310]] [bearing] [[G846]] [the] [[G1427]] names [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] apostles [[G652]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb. [[G721]] 
15 The [angel who] [[G3588]] spoke [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1473]] had [[G2192]] a golden [[G5552]] measuring [[G3358]] rod [[G2563]] to [[G2443]] measure [[G3354]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] gates [[G4440]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] walls. [[G5038]] 
16 The [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] lies [[G2749]] foursquare, [[G5068]] with [[G2532]] [its] [[G3588]] width [[G4114]] the same as [[G3745]] its [[G846]] length. [[G3372]] And [[G2532]] he measured [[G3354]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] with the [[G3588]] rod, [[G2563]] [ and all its dimensions ] were [[G1510]] equal— [[G2470]] 12,000 {} [[G1427]] stadia [[G4712]] in [[G3588]] length [[G3372]] and [[G2532]] width [[G4114]] and [[G2532]] height. [[G5311]] 
17 And [[G2532]] he measured [[G3354]] its [[G846]] wall [to be] [[G5038]] 144 {} [[G1540]] cubits, [[G4083]] by the human [[G444]] measure [[G3358]] the angel [[G32]] was [using]. [[G1510]] 
18 The [[G3588]] wall [[G5038]] was made of [[G1739]] jasper, [[G2393]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] city [itself] [[G4172]] of pure [[G2513]] gold, [[G5553]] as [[G3664]] pure as [[G2513]] glass. [[G5194]] 
19 The [[G3588]] foundations [[G2310]] of the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] walls [[G5038]] were adorned [[G2885]] with every kind of [[G3956]] precious [[G5093]] stone: [[G3037]] The [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] foundation [[G2310]] [was] jasper, [[G2393]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] sapphire, [[G4552]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] chalcedony, [[G5472]] the [[G3588]] fourth [[G5067]] emerald, [[G4665]] 
20 the [[G3588]] fifth [[G3991]] onyx, [[G4557]] the [[G3588]] sixth [[G1623]] ruby, [[G4556]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] chrysolite, [[G5555]] the [[G3588]] eighth [[G3590]] beryl, [[G969]] the [[G3588]] ninth [[G1766]] topaz, [[G5116]] the [[G3588]] tenth [[G1182]] chrysoprase, [[G5556]] the [[G3588]] eleventh [[G1734]] jacinth, [[G5192]] [and] the [[G3588]] twelfth [[G1428]] amethyst. [[G271]] 
21 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] gates [were] [[G4440]] twelve [[G1427]] pearls, [[G3135]] [with] each [[G1538]] gate [[G4440]] consisting [[G1510]] of [[G1537]] a single [[G1520]] pearl. [[G3135]] The [[G3588]] main street [[G4113]] of the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] [was] pure [[G2513]] gold, [[G5553]] as [pure as] [[G5613]] transparent [[G1306]] glass. [[G5194]] 
22 [But] [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] no [[G3756]] temple [[G3485]] in [[G1722]] [the city], [[G846]] because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty [[G3841]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] are [[G1510]] its [[G846]] temple. [[G3485]] 
23 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] has [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] for [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] [or] [[G3761]] moon [[G4582]] to [[G2443]] shine [[G5316]] on it, [[G846]] because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of God [[G2316]] illuminates [[G5461]] [the city], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] [is] its [[G846]] lamp. [[G3088]] 
24 By [[G1223]] its [[G846]] light [[G5457]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] will walk, [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] it [[G846]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] will bring [[G5342]] their [[G846]] glory. [[G1391]] 
25 Its [[G846]] gates [[G4440]] will never be shut [[G2808]] at the end of the day, [[G2250]] because [[G1063]] there will be [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] night [[G3571]] there. [[G1563]] 
26 And [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] [the city] [[G846]] will be brought [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honor [[G5092]] of the [[G3588]] nations. [[G1484]] 
27 [But] [[G2532]] nothing [[G3956]] unclean [[G2839]] will ever enter [[G1525]] it, [[G846]] [nor] [[G2532]] anyone who [[G3588]] practices [[G4160]] an abomination [[G946]] [or] [[G2532]] a lie, [[G5579]] but only [[G1487]] those whose [[G3588]] [names] are written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Lamb’s [[G721]] book [[G975]] of life. [[G2222]]
