# Revelation 16
[[Revelation 15|←]] • [[Revelation 17|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] [a] loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] saying [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels, [[G32]] “Go, [[G5217]] pour out [[G1632]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] bowls [[G5357]] of God’s [[G2316]] wrath. [[G2372]] 
2 [So] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [angel] [[G4413]] went [[G565]] and [[G2532]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] bowl [[G5357]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] loathsome, [[G2556]] malignant [[G4190]] sores [[G1668]] broke out [[G1096]] on [[G1909]] those [[G3588]] who [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] mark [[G5480]] of the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] worshiped [[G4352]] its [[G846]] image. [[G1504]] 
3 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [angel] [[G1208]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] bowl [[G5357]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] it turned to [[G1096]] blood [[G129]] like that [[G5613]] of [the] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] living [[G2222]] thing [[G5590]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] died. [[G599]] 
4 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [angel] [[G5154]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] bowl [[G5357]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] rivers [[G4215]] and [[G2532]] springs [[G4077]] of [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] they turned to [[G1096]] blood. [[G129]] 
5 And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of the [[G3588]] waters [[G5204]] say: [[G3004]] “Righteous [[G1342]] are You, [[G1510]] O [[G3588]] Holy One, [[G3741]] who [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] who [[G3588]] was, [[G1510]] because [[G3754]] You have brought these judgments. [[G2919]] 
6 For [[G3754]] they have spilled [[G1632]] [the] blood [[G129]] of saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] You have given [[G1325]] them [[G846]] blood [[G129]] to drink [[G4095]] as they [[G1510]] deserve.” [[G514]] 
7 And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] reply: [[G3004]] “Yes, [[G3483]] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty, [[G3841]] TRUE [[G228]] and [[G2532]] righteous [are] [[G1342]] Your [[G4771]] judgments.” [[G2920]] 
8 Next, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fourth [angel] [[G5067]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] bowl [[G5357]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sun, [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] it was given power [[G1325]] to scorch [[G2739]] the [[G3588]] people [[G444]] with [[G1722]] fire. [[G4442]] 
9 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G444]] were scorched [[G2739]] by intense [[G3173]] heat, [[G2738]] and [[G2532]] they cursed [[G987]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] these [[G3778]] plagues; [[G4127]] yet [[G2532]] they did not repent [[G3340]] [and] give [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] glory. [[G1391]] 
10 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fifth [angel] [[G3991]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] bowl [[G5357]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] was [[G1096]] plunged into darkness, [[G4656]] and [[G2532]] [men] began to gnaw [[G3145]] their [[G846]] tongues [[G1100]] in [[G1537]] anguish [[G4192]] 
11 and [[G2532]] curse [[G987]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] for [[G1537]] their [[G846]] pains [[G4192]] and [[G2532]] sores; [[G1668]] yet [[G2532]] they did not repent [[G3340]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] deeds. [[G2041]] 
12 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sixth [angel] [[G1623]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] bowl [[G5357]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] river [[G4215]] Euphrates, [[G2166]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] water [[G5204]] was dried up [[G3583]] to [[G2443]] prepare [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] for the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G575]] East. [[G395]] 
13 And [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] three [[G5140]] unclean [[G169]] spirits [[G4151]] that looked like [[G5613]] frogs [[G944]] [coming] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] mouths [[G4750]] of the [[G3588]] dragon, [[G1404]] the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] false prophet. [[G5578]] 
14 [These] are [[G1510]] demonic [[G1140]] spirits [[G4151]] that perform [[G4160]] signs [[G4592]] [and] go out [[G1607]] to [[G1909]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] [earth], [[G3625]] to assemble them [[G4863]] for [[G1519]] battle [[G4171]] on the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] day [[G2250]] of God, [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] Almighty. [[G3841]] 
15 “Behold, [[G2400]] I am coming [[G2064]] like [[G5613]] a thief. [[G2812]] Blessed [is] [[G3107]] the [one who] [[G3588]] remains awake [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] clothed, [[G2440]] so that [[G2443]] he will not go [[G4043]] naked [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] {let} his [[G846]] shame [[G808]] be exposed.” [[G991]] 
16 And [[G2532]] they assembled [the kings] [[G4863]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] that [[G3588]] in Hebrew [[G1447]] is called [[G2564]] Armageddon. [[G717]] 
17 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seventh [angel] [[G1442]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] bowl [[G5357]] into [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] air, [[G109]] and [[G2532]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] came [[G1831]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] [in] [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] saying, [[G3004]] “It is done!” [[G1096]] 
18 And [[G2532]] there were [[G1096]] flashes of lightning, [[G796]] and [[G2532]] rumblings, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] peals of thunder, [[G1027]] and [[G2532]] a great [[G3173]] earthquake [[G4578]] the likes of which [[G3634]] had not occurred [[G1096]] since [[G575]] men [[G444]] were [[G1096]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth— [[G1093]] so [[G3779]] mighty [[G5082]] [was the] great [[G3173]] quake. [[G4578]] 
19 The [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] city [[G4172]] was [split] [[G1096]] into [[G1519]] three [[G5140]] parts, [[G3313]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cities [[G4172]] of the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] collapsed. [[G4098]] And [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] remembered [[G3403]] Babylon [[G897]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] [and] gave [[G1325]] her [[G846]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] of the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] of the [[G3588]] fury [[G2372]] of His [[G846]] wrath. [[G3709]] 
20 Then [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] island [[G3520]] fled, [[G5343]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] mountain [[G3735]] could be found. [[G2147]] 
21 And [[G2532]] huge [[G3173]] hailstones, [[G5464]] about [[G5613]] a hundred pounds [each], [[G5006]] rained down [[G2597]] on [[G1909]] [them] [[G444]] from [[G1537]] above. [[G3772]] And [[G2532]] men [[G444]] cursed [[G987]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] plague [[G4127]] of [[G3588]] hail, [[G5464]] because [[G3754]] [it] [[G4127]] was [[G1510]] so horrendous. [[G3173]]
