[[Ezekiel 35|←]] • [[Ezekiel 37|→]]
1 And you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] to [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] and say, [[H559]] ‘O mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] Because [[H3282]] the enemy [[H341]] has said [[H559]] of you, [[H5921]] “Aha! [[H1889]] The ancient [[H5769]] heights [[H1116]] have become [[H1961]] our  possession,” [[H4181]] 
3 therefore [[H3651]] prophesy [[H5012]] and declare [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] Because [[H3282]] they have made you desolate [[H8074]] and have trampled [[H7602]] you [[H853]] on every side, [[H5439]] so that you became [[H1961]] a possession [[H4181]] of the rest [[H7611]] of the nations [[H1471]] and were taken up [[H5927]] in slander [[H1681]] by [[H5921]] the lips [[H8193]] of [their] talkers, [[H3956]] 
4 therefore, [[H3651]] O mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’ [[H3068]] This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] to the mountains [[H2022]] and hills, [[H1389]] to the ravines [[H650]] and valleys, [[H1516]] to the desolate [[H8076]] ruins [[H2723]] and abandoned [[H5800]] cities, [[H5892]] which [[H834]] have become [[H1961]] plunder [[H957]] and a mockery [[H3933]] to the rest [[H7611]] of the nations [[H1471]] all around. [[H5439]] 
5 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Surely [[H518]] in My burning [[H784]] zeal [[H7068]] I have spoken [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] the rest [[H7611]] of the nations, [[H1471]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] of Edom, [[H123]] who [[H834]] took [[H5414]] My land [[H776]] as their own possession [[H4181]] with wholehearted [[H3605]] joy [[H8057]] and with utter contempt, [[H7589]] so that [[H4616]] its pastureland [[H4054]] became plunder. [[H957]] 
6 Therefore, [[H3651]] prophesy [[H5012]] concerning [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel [[H3478]] and tell [[H559]] the mountains [[H2022]] and hills, [[H1389]] the ravines [[H650]] and valleys, [[H1516]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I have spoken [[H1696]] in My burning [[H2534]] zeal [[H7068]] because [[H3282]] you have endured [[H5375]] the reproach [[H3639]] of the nations. [[H1471]] 
7 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I [[H589]] have sworn [[H5375]] with an uplifted hand [[H3027]] that surely [[H518]] the nations [[H1471]] all around [[H5439]] you  will endure [[H5375]] reproach of their own. [[H3639]] 
8 But you, [[H859]] O mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] will produce [[H5414]] branches [[H6057]] and bear [[H5375]] fruit [[H6529]] for My people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] they will soon [[H7126]] come home. [[H935]] 
9 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I am on your side; [[H413]] I will turn [[H6437]] toward you, [[H413]] and you will be tilled [[H5647]] and sown. [[H2232]] 
10 I will multiply [[H7235]] the people [[H120]] upon you [[H5921]] with the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] in its entirety. [[H3605]] The cities [[H5892]] will be inhabited [[H3427]] and the ruins [[H2723]] rebuilt. [[H1129]] 
11 I will fill [[H7235]] you with people [[H120]] and animals, [[H929]] and they will increase [[H7235]] and be fruitful. [[H6509]] I will make you inhabited [[H3427]] as you once were, [[H6927]] and I will make you prosper [[H2895]] more than before. [[H7221]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 Yes, {I will cause} [[H853]] My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] to walk [[H1980]] upon you; [[H5921]] they will possess you, [[H3423]] and you will be [[H1961]] their inheritance, [[H5159]] and you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] deprive them [of their children].’ [[H7921]] 
13 For this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] people say [[H559]] to you,  “You [[H859]] devour [[H398]] men [[H120]] and deprive your nation [[H1471]] of its children,” [[H7921]] 
14 therefore [[H3651]] you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] devour [[H398]] men [[H120]] or deprive [[H3782]] your nation {of its children}, [[H1471]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
15 I will no [[H3808]] longer allow [[H5750]] the taunts [[H3639]] of the nations [[H1471]] to be heard [[H8085]] against you, [[H413]] and you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] endure [[H5375]] the reproach [[H2781]] of the peoples [[H5971]] [or] [[H3808]] cause your nation [[H1471]] to stumble, [[H3782]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]] 
16 Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
17 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] when the people [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] lived [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] their land, [[H127]] they defiled [[H2930]] it [[H853]] by their own ways [[H1870]] and deeds. [[H5949]] Their behavior [[H1870]] before Me [[H6440]] was [[H1961]] like the uncleanness [[H2932]] of a [woman] in her [monthly] impurity. [[H5079]] 
18 So I poured out [[H8210]] My wrath [[H2534]] upon them [[H5921]] because of [[H5921]] the blood [[H1818]] they had shed [[H8210]] on [[H5921]] the land, [[H776]] and because they had defiled [[H2930]] it with their idols. [[H1544]] 
19 I dispersed [[H6327]] them [[H853]] among the nations, [[H1471]] and they were scattered [[H2219]] throughout the lands. [[H776]] I judged them [[H8199]] according to their ways [[H1870]] and their deeds. [[H5949]] 
20 And wherever [[H834]] they went [[H935]] among the nations [[H1471]] they profaned [[H2490]] My holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] because it was said [[H559]] of them  ‘These [[H428]] are the people [[H5971]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] yet they had to leave [[H3318]] His land.’ [[H776]] 
21 But I had concern [[H2550]] for [[H5921]] My holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] which [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] had profaned [[H2490]] among the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] they had gone. [[H935]] 
22 Therefore, [[H3651]] tell [[H559]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘It is not [[H3808]] for your sake [[H4616]] that I [[H589]] will act, [[H6213]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] but [[H3588]] for My holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] which [[H834]] you profaned [[H2490]] among the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] you went. [[H935]] 
23 I will show the holiness [[H6942]] of My great [[H1419]] name, [[H8034]] which has been profaned [[H2490]] among the nations— [[H1471]] the name [[H834]] you have profaned [[H2490]] among them. [[H8432]] Then the nations [[H1471]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] when I show My holiness [[H6942]] in you  before their eyes. [[H5869]] 
24 For I will take [[H3947]] you [[H853]] from among [[H4480]] the nations [[H1471]] and gather [[H6908]] you [[H853]] out of all [[H3605]] the countries, [[H776]] and I will bring [[H935]] you [[H853]] back into [[H413]] your own land. [[H127]] 
25 I will also sprinkle [[H2236]] clean [[H2889]] water [[H4325]] on you, [[H5921]] and you will be clean. [[H2891]] I will cleanse [[H2891]] you [[H853]] from all [[H3605]] your impurities [[H2932]] and all [[H3605]] your idols. [[H1544]] 
26 I will give [[H5414]] you  a new [[H2319]] heart [[H3820]] and put [[H5414]] a new [[H2319]] spirit [[H7307]] within you; [[H7130]] I will remove [[H5493]] your heart [[H3820]] of stone [[H68]] and give [[H5414]] you a heart [[H3820]] of flesh. [[H1320]] 
27 And [[H853]] I will put [[H5414]] My Spirit [[H7307]] within you [[H7130]] and cause [[H6213]] you to walk [[H1980]] in My statutes [[H2706]] and to carefully [[H8104]] observe [[H6213]] My ordinances. [[H4941]] 
28 Then you will live [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] your forefathers; [[H1]] you will be [[H1961]] My  people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] your  God. [[H430]] 
29 I will save [[H3467]] you [[H853]] from all [[H3605]] your uncleanness. [[H2932]] I will summon [[H7121]] the grain [[H1715]] and make it plentiful, [[H7235]] and I will not [[H3808]] bring [[H5414]] famine [[H7458]] upon you. [[H5921]] 
30 I will also make the fruit [[H6529]] of the trees [[H6086]] and the crops [[H8570]] of the field [[H7704]] plentiful, [[H7235]] so that [[H4616]] you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] bear [[H3947]] reproach [[H2781]] among the nations [[H1471]] on account of famine. [[H7458]] 
31 Then you will remember [[H2142]] your evil [[H7451]] ways [[H1870]] and your deeds [[H4611]] that [[H834]] were not [[H3808]] good, [[H2896]] and you will loathe [[H6962]] yourselves [[H6440]] for [[H5921]] your iniquities [[H5771]] and [[H5921]] abominations. [[H8441]] 
32 It is not [[H3808]] for your sake [[H4616]] that I [[H589]] will act, [[H6213]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD— [[H3069]] let it be known [[H3045]] to you.  Be ashamed [[H954]] and disgraced [[H3637]] for your own ways, [[H1870]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel!’ [[H3478]] 
33 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘On the day [[H3117]] I cleanse [[H2891]] you [[H853]] from all [[H3605]] your iniquities, [[H5771]] I will cause the cities [[H5892]] to be resettled [[H3427]] and the ruins [[H2723]] to be rebuilt. [[H1129]] 
34 The desolate [[H8074]] land [[H776]] will be cultivated [[H5647]] instead of [[H8478]] lying [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] who pass through. [[H5674]] 
35 Then they will say, [[H559]] “This [[H1977]] land [[H776]] that was desolate [[H8074]] has become [[H1961]] like the garden [[H1588]] of Eden. [[H5731]] The cities [[H5892]] that were once ruined, [[H2720]] desolate, [[H8074]] and destroyed [[H2040]] are now fortified [[H1219]] and inhabited.” [[H3427]] 
36 Then the nations [[H1471]] around you [[H5439]] that [[H834]] remain [[H7604]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have rebuilt [[H1129]] what was destroyed, [[H2040]] and I have replanted [[H5193]] what was desolate. [[H8074]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken, [[H1696]] and I will do it.’ [[H6213]] 
37 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Once again [[H5750]] I will hear the plea [[H1875]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and do [[H6213]] for them  this: [[H2063]] I will multiply [[H7235]] their people [[H120]] like a flock. [[H6629]] 
38 Like the numerous flocks [[H6629]] for sacrifices [[H6944]] at Jerusalem [[H3389]] during her appointed feasts, [[H4150]] so [[H3651]] the ruined [[H2720]] cities [[H5892]] will be [[H1961]] filled [[H4392]] with flocks [[H6629]] of people. [[H120]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]]
