# Ezekiel 34
[[Ezekiel 33|←]] • [[Ezekiel 35|→]]
1 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] the shepherds [[H7462]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Prophesy [[H5012]] and tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Woe [[H1945]] to the shepherds [[H7462]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H834]] only feed [[H7462]] themselves! [[H853]] Should not [[H3808]] the shepherds [[H7462]] feed [[H7462]] their flock? [[H7462]] 
3 You eat [[H398]] the fat, [[H2459]] wear [[H3847]] the wool, [[H6785]] and butcher [[H2076]] the fattened sheep, [[H1277]] but you do not [[H3808]] feed [[H7462]] the flock. [[H6629]] 
4 You have not [[H3808]] strengthened [[H2388]] the weak, [[H2470]] healed [[H7495]] the sick, [[H2470]] bound up [[H2280]] the injured, [[H7665]] brought back [[H7725]] the strays, [[H5080]] or searched for [[H1245]] the lost. [[H6]] Instead, [[H3808]] you have ruled [[H7287]] them with violence [[H2394]] and cruelty. [[H6531]] 
5 They were scattered [[H6327]] for lack of [[H1097]] a shepherd, [[H7462]] and when they were scattered, [[H6327]] they became [[H1961]] food [[H402]] for all [[H3605]] the wild [[H7704]] beasts. [[H2416]] 
6 My flock [[H6629]] went astray [[H7686]] on all [[H3605]] the mountains [[H2022]] and [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H7311]] hill. [[H1389]] They were scattered [[H6327]] over the face [[H6440]] of all [[H3605]] the earth, [[H776]] with no one [[H369]] to search [[H1875]] or seek for them.’ [[H1245]] 
7 Therefore, [[H3651]] you shepherds, [[H7462]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] 
8 ‘As surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] because [[H3282]] My flock [[H6629]] lacks [[H369]] a shepherd [[H7462]] and has become [[H1961]] prey [[H957]] [and] [[H6629]] food [[H402]] for every [[H3605]] wild [[H7704]] beast, [[H2416]] and because My shepherds [[H7462]] did not [[H3808]] search [[H1875]] for My flock [[H6629]] but fed [[H7462]] themselves [[H853]] [instead], [[H853]] 
9 therefore, [[H3651]] you shepherds, [[H7462]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD!’ [[H3068]] 
10 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I [am] against [[H413]] the shepherds, [[H7462]] and I will demand [[H1875]] My flock [[H6629]] from them [[H3027]] and remove them [[H7673]] from tending [[H7462]] the flock, [[H6629]] so that they can no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] feed [[H7462]] themselves. [[H853]] For I will deliver [[H5337]] My flock [[H6629]] from their mouths, [[H6310]] and it will no longer [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] food [[H402]] for them.  
11 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I Myself [[H589]] will search for [[H1875]] My flock [[H6629]] and seek them out. [[H1239]] 
12 As a shepherd [[H7462]] looks for [[H1243]] his scattered [[H6567]] sheep [[H5739]] when [[H3117]] he is [[H1961]] among [[H8432]] the flock, [[H6629]] so [[H3651]] I will look for [[H1239]] My flock. [[H6629]] I will rescue [[H5337]] them from [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the places [[H4725]] to which [[H834]] they have been scattered [[H6327]] on a day [[H3117]] of clouds [[H6051]] and darkness. [[H6205]] 
13 I will bring them out [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the peoples, [[H5971]] gather [[H6908]] them from [[H4480]] the countries, [[H776]] and bring [[H935]] them into [[H413]] their own land. [[H127]] I will feed [[H7462]] them on [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] in the ravines, [[H650]] and in all [[H3605]] the settlements [[H4186]] of the land. [[H776]] 
14 I will feed [[H7462]] them [[H853]] in good [[H2896]] pasture, [[H4829]] and the lofty [[H4791]] mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] will be [[H1961]] their grazing land. [[H5116]] There [[H8033]] they will lie down [[H7257]] in a good [[H2896]] grazing land; [[H5116]] they will feed [[H7462]] in rich [[H8082]] pasture [[H4829]] on [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
15 I [[H589]] will tend [[H7462]] My flock [[H6629]] and make them lie down, [[H7257]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
16 I will seek [[H1245]] the lost, [[H6]] bring back [[H7725]] the strays, [[H5080]] bind up [[H2280]] the broken, [[H7665]] and strengthen [[H2388]] the weak; [[H2470]] but the sleek [[H8082]] and strong [[H2389]] I will destroy. [[H8045]] I will shepherd them [[H7462]] with justice.’ [[H4941]] 
17 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] to you, [[H859]] My flock: [[H6629]] ‘I will judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] one sheep [[H7716]] and another, [[H7716]] between the rams [[H352]] and the goats. [[H6260]] 
18 Is it not enough [[H4592]] for [[H4480]] you to feed on [[H7462]] the good [[H2896]] pasture? [[H4829]] Must you also trample [[H7429]] the rest [[H3499]] of the pasture [[H4829]] with your feet? [[H7272]] Is not it enough for you to drink [[H8354]] the clear [[H4950]] water? [[H4325]] Must you also muddy [[H7515]] the rest [[H3498]] with your feet? [[H7272]] 
19 Why must My flock [[H6629]] feed on [[H7462]] what your feet [[H7272]] have trampled, [[H4823]] and drink [[H8354]] what your feet [[H7272]] have muddied?’ [[H4833]] 
20 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I Myself [[H589]] will judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] the fat [[H1277]] sheep [[H7716]] and the lean [[H7330]] sheep. [[H7716]] 
21 Since [[H3282]] you shove [[H1920]] with flank [[H6654]] and shoulder, [[H3802]] and butt [[H5055]] all [[H3605]] the weak ones [[H2470]] with your horns [[H7161]] until [[H5704]] you scattered [[H6327]] them [[H853]] abroad, [[H2351]] 
22 I will save [[H3467]] My flock, [[H6629]] and they will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] prey. [[H957]] I will judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] one sheep [[H7716]] and another. [[H7716]] 
23 I will appoint [[H6965]] over them [[H5921]] one [[H259]] shepherd, [[H7462]] My servant [[H5650]] David, [[H1732]] and he will feed [[H7462]] them. [[H853]] He [[H1931]] will feed [[H7462]] them [[H853]] and [[H1931]] be [[H1961]] their  shepherd. [[H7462]] 
24 I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] their God, [[H430]] and My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] will be a prince [[H5387]] among them. [[H8432]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken.’ [[H1696]] 
25 ‘I will make [[H3772]] with them  a covenant [[H1285]] of peace [[H7965]] and rid [[H7673]] the land [[H776]] of [[H4480]] wild [[H7451]] animals, [[H2416]] so that they may dwell [[H3427]] securely [[H983]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] and sleep [[H3462]] in the forest. [[H3293]] 
26 I will make [[H5414]] them [[H853]] and the places all around [[H5439]] My hill [[H1389]] a blessing. [[H1293]] I will send down [[H3381]] showers [[H1653]] in their season— [[H6256]] showers [[H1653]] of blessing. [[H1293]] 
27 The trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] will give [[H5414]] their fruit, [[H6529]] and the land [[H776]] will yield [[H5414]] its produce; [[H2981]] My flock will be [[H1961]] secure [[H983]] in [[H5921]] their land. [[H127]] They will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] when I have broken [[H7665]] the bars [[H4133]] of their yoke [[H5923]] and delivered them [[H5337]] from the hands [[H3027]] that enslaved [[H5647]] them.  
28 They will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] prey [[H957]] for the nations, [[H1471]] and the beasts [[H2416]] of the earth [[H776]] will not [[H3808]] consume them. [[H398]] They will dwell securely, [[H3427]] and no [[H369]] one will frighten them. [[H2729]] 
29 And I will raise up [[H6965]] for them  a garden [[H4302]] of renown, [[H8034]] and they will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] victims [[H622]] of famine [[H7458]] in the land [[H776]] [or] [[H3808]] bear [[H5375]] the scorn [[H3639]] of the nations. [[H1471]] 
30 Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] am with them, [[H854]] and that they, [[H1992]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] are My people, [[H5971]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
31 You [[H859]] are My flock, [[H6629]] the sheep [[H6629]] of My pasture, [[H4830]] My people, [[H120]] and I [[H589]] am your God,’ [[H430]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.” [[H3069]]
