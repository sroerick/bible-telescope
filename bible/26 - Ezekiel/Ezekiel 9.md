[[Ezekiel 8|←]] • [[Ezekiel 10|→]]
1 Then I heard Him [[H241]] call out [[H7121]] in a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] saying, [[H559]] “Draw near, [[H7126]] O executioners [[H6486]] of the city, [[H5892]] each [[H376]] [with] a weapon [[H3627]] of destruction [[H4892]] in his hand.” [[H3027]] 
2 And I saw [[H2009]] six [[H8337]] men [[H376]] coming [[H935]] from the direction [[H1870]] of the Upper [[H5945]] Gate, [[H8179]] which [[H834]] faces [[H6437]] north, [[H6828]] each [[H376]] with a weapon [[H3627]] of slaughter [[H4660]] in his hand. [[H3027]] With them [[H8432]] was another [[H259]] man [[H376]] clothed [[H3847]] in linen [[H906]] who had a writing kit [[H7083]] at his side. [[H4975]] And they came in [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] the bronze [[H5178]] altar. [[H4196]] 
3 Then the glory [[H3519]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] rose [[H5927]] from above [[H5921]] the cherubim, [[H3742]] where [[H834]] it had been, [[H1961]] [and moved] [[H5921]] to [[H413]] the threshold [[H4670]] of the temple. [[H1004]] And He called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] clothed [[H3847]] in linen [[H906]] who had the writing kit [[H7083]] at his side. [[H4975]] 
4 “Go [[H5674]] throughout [[H8432]] the city [[H5892]] of [[H8432]] Jerusalem,” [[H3389]] said [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3069]] “and put [[H8427]] a mark [[H8420]] on [[H5921]] the foreheads [[H4696]] of the men [[H582]] sighing [[H584]] and groaning [[H602]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] committed [[H6213]] there.” [[H8432]] 
5 And as I listened, [[H241]] He said [[H559]] to the others, [[H428]] “Follow him [[H5674]] through the city [[H5892]] and start killing; [[H5221]] do not [[H408]] show pity [[H5869]] or spare anyone! [[H2550]] 
6 Slaughter [[H2026]] the old men, [[H2205]] the young men [[H970]] and maidens, [[H1330]] the women [[H802]] and children, [[H2945]] but do not [[H408]] go near [[H5066]] anyone [[H3605]] who [[H834]] has the mark. [[H8420]] Now begin [[H2490]] at My sanctuary.” [[H4720]] So they began [[H2490]] with the elders [[H2205]] who [were] [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the temple. [[H1004]] 
7 Then He told [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “Defile [[H2930]] the temple [[H1004]] and fill [[H4390]] the courts [[H2691]] with the slain. [[H2491]] Go forth!” [[H3318]] So they went out [[H3318]] and began killing [[H5221]] throughout the city. [[H5892]] 
8 While they were killing, [[H5221]] I [[H589]] was left alone. [[H7604]] And I fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H5921]] and cried out, [[H2199]] “Oh, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] when You pour out [[H8210]] Your wrath [[H2534]] on [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] will You [[H859]] destroy [[H7843]] the entire [[H3605]] remnant [[H7611]] of Israel?” [[H3478]] 
9 And He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “The iniquity [[H5771]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah [[H3063]] [is] exceedingly [[H3966]] great. [[H1419]] The land [[H776]] is full of [[H4390]] bloodshed, [[H1818]] and the city [[H5892]] full of [[H4390]] perversity. [[H4297]] For [[H3588]] they say, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] has forsaken [[H5800]] the land; [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] does not [[H369]] see. [[H7200]] 
10 But as for Me, [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will not [[H3808]] show pity [[H2347]] or spare them. [[H2550]] I will bring their deeds [[H1870]] down [[H5414]] upon their own heads.” [[H7218]] 
11 Then [[H2009]] the man [[H376]] clothed [[H3830]] in linen [[H906]] with the writing kit [[H7083]] at his side [[H4975]] reported back, [[H7725]] “I have done [[H6213]] as [[H834]] You  commanded.” [[H6680]]
