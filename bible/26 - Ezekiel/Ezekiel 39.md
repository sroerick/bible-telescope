[[Ezekiel 38|←]] • [[Ezekiel 40|→]]
1 As for you, [[H859]] O son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] Gog [[H1463]] and tell him [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I am against you, [[H413]] O Gog, [[H1463]] chief [[H7218]] prince [[H5387]] of Meshech [[H4902]] and Tubal. [[H8422]] 
2 I will turn you around, [[H7725]] drive you along, [[H8338]] bring you up [[H5927]] from the far [[H3411]] north, [[H6828]] and send you [[H935]] against [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
3 Then I will strike [[H5221]] the bow [[H7198]] from your left [[H8040]] hand [[H3027]] and dash down [[H5307]] the arrows [[H2671]] from your right [[H3225]] hand. [[H3027]] 
4 On [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] you will fall— [[H5307]] you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] your troops [[H102]] and the nations [[H5971]] with you. [[H854]] I will give [[H5414]] you as food [[H402]] to every kind [[H3605]] of ravenous bird [[H5861]] and wild [[H7704]] beast. [[H2416]] 
5 You will fall [[H5307]] in [[H5921]] the open field, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have spoken, [[H1696]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
6 I will send [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] against Magog [[H4031]] and those who dwell [[H3427]] securely [[H983]] in the coastlands, [[H339]] and they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 So [[H853]] I will make My holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] known [[H3045]] among [[H8432]] My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] and will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] allow it [[H8034]] to be profaned. [[H2490]] Then the nations [[H1471]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] the Holy [[H6918]] One in Israel. [[H3478]] 
8 Yes, [[H2009]] it is coming, [[H935]] and it will surely happen, [[H1961]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3068]] This [[H1931]] is the day [[H3117]] of which [[H834]] I have spoken. [[H1696]] 
9 Then those who dwell [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Israel [[H3478]] will go out, [[H3318]] kindle fires, [[H1197]] and burn [[H5400]] the weapons— [[H5402]] the bucklers [[H4043]] and shields, [[H6793]] the bows [[H7198]] and arrows, [[H2671]] the clubs [[H4731]] and spears. [[H7420]] For seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] they will use them for fuel. [[H1197]] 
10 They will not [[H3808]] gather [[H5375]] wood [[H6086]] from [[H4480]] the countryside [[H7704]] or cut it [[H2404]] from [[H4480]] the forests, [[H3293]] for [[H3588]] they will use the weapons [[H5402]] for fuel. [[H1197]] They will loot [[H7997]] those who looted them [[H7997]] and plunder [[H962]] those who plundered them, [[H962]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
11 And [[H1961]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will give [[H5414]] Gog [[H1463]] a burial [[H6913]] place [[H4725]] in Israel, [[H3478]] the Valley [[H1516]] of the Travelers, [[H5674]] east [[H6926]] of the Sea. [[H3220]] It [[H1931]] will block [[H2629]] those who travel through, [[H5674]] because Gog [[H1463]] and all [[H3605]] his hordes [[H1995]] will be buried [[H6912]] there. [[H8033]] So it will be called [[H7121]] the Valley of Hamon-gog. [[H1996]] 
12 For seven [[H7651]] months [[H2320]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] will be burying them [[H6912]] in order [[H4616]] to cleanse [[H2891]] the land. [[H776]] 
13 All [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] will bury them [[H6912]] and will be [[H1961]] renowned [[H8034]] for it  on the day [[H3117]] I display My glory, [[H3513]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
14 And men [[H376]] will be employed [[H914]] to continually [[H8548]] pass [[H5674]] through the land [[H776]] to cleanse it [[H2891]] by burying [[H6912]] the invaders [[H5674]] who remain [[H3498]] on [[H5921]] the ground. [[H776]] At the end [[H7097]] of the seven [[H7651]] months [[H2320]] they will begin their search. [[H2713]] 
15 As they [[H5674]] pass [[H5674]] through the land, [[H776]] anyone who sees [[H7200]] a human [[H120]] bone [[H6106]] will set up [[H1129]] a pillar [[H6725]] next to it, [[H681]] until [[H5704]] the gravediggers [[H6912]] have buried [[H6912]] it in [[H413]] the Valley of Hamon-gog. [[H1996]] 
16 (Even the city [[H5892]] will be [[H1571]] named [[H8034]] Hamonah.) [[H1997]] And so they will cleanse [[H2891]] the land.’ [[H776]] 
17 And as for you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Call out to [[H559]] every kind [[H3605]] of bird [[H6833]] and to every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field: [[H7704]] Assemble [[H6908]] and come [[H935]] together [[H622]] from all around [[H5439]] to [[H5921]] the sacrificial feast [[H2077]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] am preparing for you, [[H2076]] a great [[H1419]] feast on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel. [[H3478]] There you will eat [[H398]] flesh [[H1320]] and drink [[H8354]] blood. [[H1818]] 
18 You will eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of the mighty [[H1368]] and drink [[H8354]] the blood [[H1818]] of the princes [[H5387]] of the earth [[H776]] [as though they were rams, [[H352]] lambs, [[H3733]] goats, [[H6260]] and bulls— [[H6499]] all [[H3605]] the fattened animals [[H4806]] of Bashan. [[H1316]] 
19 At the sacrifice [[H2077]] I am preparing, [[H2076]] you will eat [[H398]] fat [[H2459]] until you are gorged [[H7654]] and drink [[H8354]] blood [[H1818]] until you are drunk. [[H7943]] 
20 And at [[H5921]] My table [[H7979]] you will eat your fill [[H7646]] of horses [[H5483]] and riders, [[H7393]] of mighty men [[H1368]] and warriors [[H376]] of every kind, [[H3605]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’ [[H3069]] 
21 ‘I will display [[H5414]] My glory [[H3519]] among the nations, [[H1471]] and all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] will see [[H7200]] the judgment [[H4941]] that [[H834]] I execute [[H6213]] and the hand [[H3027]] that [[H834]] I lay [[H7760]] upon them.  
22 From [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] forward [[H1973]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]] 
23 And the nations [[H1471]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] went into exile [[H1540]] for their iniquity, [[H5771]] because [[H5921]] they were unfaithful [[H4603]] to Me.  So I hid [[H5641]] My face [[H6440]] from them [[H1992]] and gave them [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies, [[H6862]] so that they all [[H3605]] fell [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]] 
24 I dealt [[H6213]] with them [[H853]] according to their uncleanness [[H2932]] and transgressions, [[H6588]] and I hid [[H5641]] My face [[H6440]] from them. [[H1992]] 
25 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Now [[H6258]] I will restore [[H7725]] Jacob [[H3290]] from captivity [[H7622]] and will have compassion [[H7355]] on the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and I will be jealous [[H7065]] for My holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]] 
26 They will forget [[H5375]] their disgrace [[H3639]] and all [[H3605]] the treachery [[H4604]] they committed against Me, [[H4603]] when they dwell [[H3427]] securely [[H983]] in [[H5921]] their land, [[H127]] with no [[H369]] one to frighten them. [[H2729]] 
27 When I bring them back [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] the peoples [[H5971]] and gather [[H6908]] them [[H853]] out of the lands [[H776]] of their enemies, [[H341]] I will show My holiness [[H6942]] in them  in the sight [[H5869]] of many [[H7227]] nations. [[H1471]] 
28 Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] when I regather [[H3664]] them to [[H5921]] their own land, [[H127]] after exiling [[H1540]] them among [[H413]] the nations, [[H1471]] not leaving [[H3808]] any [[H5750]] of them [[H1992]] behind. [[H3498]] 
29 And I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] hide [[H5641]] My face [[H6440]] from them, [[H1992]] for [[H834]] I will pour out [[H8210]] My Spirit [[H7307]] on [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel,’ [[H3478]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.” [[H3069]]
