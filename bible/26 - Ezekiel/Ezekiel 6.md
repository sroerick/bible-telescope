# Ezekiel 6
[[Ezekiel 5|←]] • [[Ezekiel 7|→]]
1 And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] turn [[H7760]] your face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against them. [[H413]] 
3 You are to say: [[H559]] ‘O mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD! [[H3069]] This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] to the mountains [[H2022]] and hills, [[H1389]] to the ravines [[H650]] and valleys: [[H1516]] I [[H589]] am about to bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] against you, [[H5921]] and I will destroy [[H6]] your high places. [[H1116]] 
4 Your altars [[H4196]] will be demolished [[H8074]] and your incense altars [[H2553]] will be smashed; [[H7665]] and I will cast down [[H5307]] your slain [[H2491]] before [[H6440]] your idols. [[H1544]] 
5 I will lay [[H5414]] the corpses [[H6297]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] before [[H6440]] their idols [[H1544]] and scatter [[H2219]] your bones [[H6106]] around [[H5439]] your altars. [[H4196]] 
6 Wherever [[H3605]] you live, [[H4186]] the cities [[H5892]] will be laid waste [[H2717]] and the high places [[H1116]] will be demolished, [[H3456]] so that [[H4616]] your altars [[H4196]] will be laid waste [[H2717]] and desecrated, [[H816]] your idols [[H1544]] smashed [[H7665]] and obliterated, [[H7673]] your incense altars [[H2553]] cut down, [[H1438]] and your works [[H4639]] blotted out. [[H4229]] 
7 The slain [[H2491]] will fall [[H5307]] among you, [[H8432]] and you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
8 Yet I will leave a remnant. [[H3498]] For some of you [[H1961]] will escape [[H6412]] the sword [[H2719]] when you are scattered [[H2219]] among the nations [[H1471]] and throughout the lands. [[H776]] 
9 Then in the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] they have been carried captive, [[H7617]] your survivors [[H6412]] will remember [[H2142]] Me— [[H853]] how [[H834]] I have been grieved [[H7665]] by their adulterous [[H2181]] hearts [[H3820]] that [[H834]] turned away [[H5493]] from Me, [[H5921]] and by [[H854]] their eyes [[H5869]] that lusted [[H2181]] after [[H310]] idols. [[H1544]] So they will loathe [[H6962]] themselves [[H6440]] for [[H413]] the evil [[H7451]] they have done [[H6213]] and for all [[H3605]] their abominations. [[H8441]] 
10 And they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD; [[H3068]] I did not [[H3808]] declare [[H1696]] in [[H413]] vain [[H2600]] that I would bring [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] calamity [[H7451]] upon them.  
11 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Clap [[H5221]] your hands, [[H3709]] stomp [[H7554]] your feet, [[H7272]] and cry [[H559]] “Alas” [[H253]] for [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7451]] abominations [[H8441]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H834]] will fall [[H5307]] by sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague. [[H1698]] 
12 He who is far off [[H7350]] will die [[H4191]] by the plague, [[H1698]] he who is near [[H7138]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and he who remains [[H7604]] will die [[H4191]] of famine. [[H7458]] So I will vent [[H3615]] My fury [[H2534]] upon them.  
13 Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] when their slain [[H2491]] lie [[H1961]] among [[H8432]] their idols [[H1544]] around [[H5439]] their altars, [[H4196]] on [[H413]] every [[H3605]] high [[H7311]] hill, [[H1389]] on all [[H3605]] the mountaintops, [[H7218]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree [[H6086]] [and] [[H3605]] leafy [[H5687]] oak [[H424]] the places [[H4725]] where [[H834]] they offered [[H5414]] fragrant [[H5207]] incense [[H7381]] to all [[H3605]] their idols. [[H1544]] 
14 I will stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against them, [[H5921]] and wherever [[H3605]] they live [[H4186]] I will make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] a desolate [[H8077]] waste, [[H4923]] from the wilderness [[H4057]] to Diblah. [[H1689]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]]
