# Ezekiel 22
[[Ezekiel 21|←]] • [[Ezekiel 23|→]]
1 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “As for you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] will you judge her? [[H8199]] Will you pass judgment [[H8199]] on the city [[H5892]] of bloodshed? [[H1818]] Then confront her [[H3045]] with all [[H3605]] her abominations [[H8441]] 
3 and tell her [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘O city [[H5892]] who brings her own doom [[H6256]] by shedding [[H8210]] blood [[H1818]] within her walls [[H8432]] and making [[H6213]] idols [[H1544]] to defile herself, [[H2930]] 
4 you are guilty [[H816]] of the blood [[H1818]] you have shed, [[H8210]] and you are defiled [[H2930]] by the idols [[H1544]] you have made. [[H6213]] You have brought your days [[H3117]] to a close [[H7126]] and have come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] [the] [end] [of] your years. [[H8141]] Therefore [[H5921]] I have made you [[H5414]] a reproach [[H2781]] to the nations [[H1471]] and a mockery [[H7048]] to all [[H3605]] the lands. [[H776]] 
5 Those near [[H7138]] and far [[H7350]] will mock [[H7046]] you,  O infamous [city], [[H2931]] full [[H7227]] of turmoil. [[H4103]] 
6 See how [[H2009]] every [[H376]] prince [[H5387]] of Israel [[H3478]] within you  has used [[H1961]] his power [[H2220]] to [[H4616]] shed [[H8210]] blood. [[H1818]] 
7 Father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] are treated with contempt. [[H7043]] Within your walls  the foreign resident [[H1616]] is exploited, [[H6213]] the fatherless [[H3490]] and the widow [[H490]] are oppressed. [[H3238]] 
8 You have despised [[H959]] My holy things [[H6944]] and [[H853]] profaned [[H2490]] My Sabbaths. [[H7676]] 
9 Among you  are [[H1961]] slanderous [[H7400]] men [[H582]] bent on [[H4616]] bloodshed; [[H1818]] within you  are those who eat [[H398]] on [[H413]] the mountain [shrines] [[H2022]] and commit [[H6213]] acts of indecency. [[H2154]] 
10 In you  they have uncovered [[H1540]] the nakedness [[H6172]] of their fathers; [[H1]] in you  they violate [[H6031]] women during their impurity. [[H2931]] 
11 One man [[H376]] commits [[H6213]] an abomination [[H8441]] with [[H854]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife; [[H802]] another [[H376]] wickedly [[H2154]] defiles [[H2930]] his daughter-in-law; [[H3618]] and yet another [[H376]] violates [[H6031]] his sister, [[H269]] his own father’s [[H1]] daughter. [[H1323]] 
12 In you  they take [[H3947]] bribes [[H7810]] to [[H4616]] shed [[H8210]] blood. [[H1818]] You engage [[H3947]] in usury, [[H5392]] take [[H1214]] excess interest, [[H8636]] and extort [[H6233]] your neighbors. [[H7453]] But Me [[H853]] you have forgotten, [[H7911]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
13 Now look, [[H2009]] I strike [[H5221]] My hands [[H3709]] together against [[H413]] your unjust gain [[H1215]] and against [[H5921]] the blood you have shed [[H1818]] in your midst. [[H8432]] 
14 Will your courage [[H3820]] endure [[H5975]] or [[H518]] your hands [[H3027]] be strong [[H2388]] in the day [[H3117]] I [[H589]] deal [[H6213]] with you? [[H854]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken, [[H1696]] and I will act. [[H6213]] 
15 I will disperse [[H6327]] you among the nations [[H1471]] and scatter you [[H2219]] throughout the lands; [[H776]] I will purge [[H8552]] your uncleanness. [[H2932]] 
16 And when you have defiled [[H2490]] yourself  in the eyes [[H5869]] of the nations, [[H1471]] then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]] 
17 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
18 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] has become [[H1961]] dross to Me. [[H5509]] All [[H3605]] of them are copper, [[H5178]] tin, [[H913]] iron, [[H1270]] and lead [[H5777]] inside [[H8432]] the furnace; [[H3564]] they are but [[H1961]] the dross [[H5509]] of silver. [[H3701]] 
19 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] all [[H3605]] of you have become [[H1961]] dross, [[H5509]] behold, [[H2005]] I will gather [[H6908]] you [[H853]] into [[H413]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
20 Just as one gathers [[H6910]] silver, [[H3701]] copper, [[H5178]] iron, [[H1270]] lead, [[H5777]] and tin [[H913]] into [[H413]] the furnace [[H3564]] to melt [[H5413]] with a fiery [[H784]] blast, [[H5301]] so [[H3651]] I will gather [[H6908]] you in My anger [[H639]] and wrath, [[H2534]] leave [you] [there], [[H3240]] and melt [[H5413]] you. [[H853]] 
21 Yes, I will gather you together [[H3664]] and blow [[H5301]] on you [[H5921]] with the fire [[H784]] of My wrath, [[H5678]] and you will be melted [[H5413]] within the city. [[H8432]] 
22 As silver [[H3701]] is melted [[H2046]] in [[H8432]] a furnace, [[H3564]] so [[H3651]] you will be melted [[H5413]] inside the city. [[H8432]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have poured out [[H8210]] My wrath [[H2534]] upon you.’” [[H5921]] 
23 And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
24 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] say [[H559]] to her,  ‘In the day [[H3117]] of indignation, [[H2195]] you [[H859]] are a land [[H776]] that has not [[H3808]] been cleansed, [[H2891]] upon which [[H1931]] [no] rain has fallen.’ [[H1656]] 
25 The conspiracy [[H7195]] of the princes [[H5030]] in her midst [[H8432]] is like a roaring [[H7580]] lion [[H738]] tearing [[H2963]] its prey. [[H2964]] They devour [[H398]] the people, [[H5315]] seize [[H3947]] the treasures [[H2633]] and precious things, [[H3366]] and multiply [[H7235]] the widows [[H490]] within her. [[H8432]] 
26 Her priests [[H3548]] do violence to [[H2554]] My law [[H8451]] and profane [[H2490]] My holy things. [[H6944]] They make no [[H3808]] distinction [[H914]] between [[H996]] the holy [[H6944]] and the common, [[H2455]] and they fail [[H3808]] to distinguish [[H3045]] between [[H996]] the clean [[H2889]] and the unclean. [[H2931]] They disregard [[H5956]] My Sabbaths, [[H7676]] so that I am profaned [[H2490]] among them. [[H8432]] 
27 Her officials [[H8269]] within [[H7130]] her are like wolves [[H2061]] tearing [[H2963]] their prey, [[H2964]] shedding [[H8210]] blood, [[H1818]] and destroying [[H6]] lives [[H5315]] for [[H4616]] dishonest gain. [[H1214]] 
28 Her prophets [[H5030]] whitewash [[H8602]] [these deeds]  by false [[H7723]] visions [[H2374]] and lying [[H3577]] divinations, [[H7080]] saying, [[H559]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says,’ [[H559]] when the LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] spoken. [[H1696]] 
29 The people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] have practiced [[H6231]] extortion [[H6233]] and committed robbery. [[H1497]] They have oppressed [[H3238]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy, [[H34]] and exploited [[H6231]] the foreign resident [[H1616]] without [[H3808]] justice. [[H4941]] 
30 I searched for [[H1245]] a man [[H376]] among them [[H1992]] to repair [[H1443]] the wall [[H1447]] and stand [[H5975]] in the gap [[H6556]] before Me [[H6440]] on behalf of [[H1157]] the land, [[H776]] so that I should not [[H1115]] destroy it. [[H7843]] But I found [[H4672]] no one. [[H3808]] 
31 So I have poured out [[H8210]] My indignation [[H2195]] upon them [[H5921]] and consumed [[H3615]] them with the fire [[H784]] of My fury. [[H5678]] I have brought [[H5414]] their ways [[H1870]] down upon their own heads, [[H7218]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.” [[H3069]]
