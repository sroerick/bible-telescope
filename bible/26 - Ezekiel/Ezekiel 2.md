# Ezekiel 2
[[Ezekiel 1|←]] • [[Ezekiel 3|→]]
1 “Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “stand up [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] your feet [[H7272]] and I will speak [[H1696]] to you.” [[H853]] 
2 And as [[H834]] He spoke [[H1696]] to me, [[H413]] the Spirit [[H7307]] entered me [[H935]] and set [[H5975]] me on [[H5921]] my feet, [[H7272]] and I heard [[H8085]] [Him] speaking [[H1696]] to me. [[H413]] 
3 “Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] He said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “I [[H589]] am sending [[H7971]] you to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] to [[H413]] a rebellious [[H4775]] nation [[H1471]] that [[H834]] has rebelled [[H4775]] against Me.  To [[H5704]] this very [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] the Israelites [[H1992]] and their fathers [[H1]] have transgressed [[H6586]] against Me.  
4 They are obstinate [[H7186]] and hardhearted [[H2389]] children. [[H1121]] I [[H589]] am sending [[H7971]] you to them, [[H413]] and you are to say [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says.’ [[H559]] 
5 And whether [[H518]] they [[H1992]] listen [[H8085]] or [[H518]] refuse to listen— [[H2308]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are a rebellious [[H4805]] house— [[H1004]] they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] a prophet [[H5030]] has been [[H1961]] among them. [[H8432]] 
6 But you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them [[H1992]] or their words. [[H1697]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] though [[H3588]] briers [[H5621]] and thorns [[H5544]] surround [[H854]] you, [[H859]] and you dwell [[H3427]] among [[H413]] scorpions. [[H6137]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of their words [[H1697]] or dismayed [[H2865]] by their presence, [[H6440]] though [[H3588]] they are a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]] 
7 But speak [[H1696]] My words [[H1697]] to them, [[H413]] whether [[H518]] they listen [[H8085]] or [[H518]] refuse [[H2308]] to listen, [[H3588]] for they [[H1992]] are rebellious. [[H4805]] 
8 But you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] listen [[H8085]] to what [[H834]] I [[H589]] tell you. [[H1696]] Do not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] rebellious [[H4805]] like that rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]] Open [[H6475]] your mouth [[H6310]] and eat [[H398]] what [[H834]] I [[H589]] give [[H5414]] you.” [[H413]] 
9 Then I looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] a hand [[H3027]] reaching out [[H7971]] to me, [[H413]] and [[H2009]] in it  was a scroll, [[H4039]] 
10 which He unrolled [[H6566]] before me. [[H6440]] And written [[H3789]] on the front [[H6440]] and back [[H268]] of it [[H413]] [were] words of lamentation, [[H7015]] mourning, [[H1899]] and woe. [[H1958]]
