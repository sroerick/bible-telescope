# Ezekiel 13
[[Ezekiel 12|←]] • [[Ezekiel 14|→]]
1 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H413]] the prophets [[H5030]] of Israel [[H3478]] who are now prophesying. [[H5012]] Tell [[H559]] those who prophesy [[H5030]] out of their own imagination: [[H3820]] ‘Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD! [[H3068]] 
3 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] Woe [[H1945]] to [[H5921]] the foolish [[H5036]] prophets [[H5030]] who [[H834]] follow [[H1980]] their own spirit, [[H7307]] yet have seen [[H7200]] nothing. [[H1115]] 
4 Your prophets, [[H5030]] O Israel, [[H3478]] are [[H1961]] like jackals [[H7776]] among the ruins. [[H2723]] 
5 You did not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] to the gaps [[H6556]] or restore [[H1443]] the wall [[H1447]] around [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] so that it would stand [[H5975]] in the battle [[H4421]] on the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
6 They see [[H2372]] false visions [[H7723]] and speak lying [[H3577]] divinations. [[H7081]] They claim, [[H559]] “Thus declares [[H5002]] the LORD,” [[H3068]] when the LORD [[H3068]] did not [[H3808]] send them; [[H7971]] yet they wait [[H3176]] for the fulfillment [[H6965]] of their message. [[H1697]] 
7 Have you not [[H3808]] seen [[H2372]] a false [[H7723]] vision [[H4236]] and spoken [[H559]] a lying [[H3577]] divination [[H4738]] when you proclaimed, [[H1696]] “Thus declares [[H5002]] the LORD,” [[H3068]] even though I [[H589]] had not [[H3808]] spoken?’ [[H1696]] 
8 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you have uttered [[H1696]] vain words [[H7723]] and seen [[H2372]] false visions, [[H3577]] I am against you, [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
9 My hand [[H3027]] will be [[H1961]] against [[H413]] the prophets [[H5030]] who see [[H2374]] false visions [[H7723]] and speak lying [[H3577]] divinations. [[H7080]] They will not [[H3808]] belong [[H1961]] to the council [[H5475]] of My people [[H5971]] or be recorded [[H3789]] in the register [[H3791]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] nor will they [[H3808]] enter [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3068]] 
10 Because [[H3282]] they have led My people [[H5971]] astray, [[H2937]] saying, [[H559]] “Peace,” [[H7965]] when there is no [[H369]] peace, [[H7965]] and whitewashing [[H2902]] any flimsy wall [[H2434]] that is built, [[H1129]] 
11 tell [[H559]] those whitewashing it [[H2902]] that it will fall. [[H5307]] Rain [[H1653]] will come [[H1961]] in torrents, [[H7857]] I will send hailstones [[H68]] plunging down, [[H5307]] and a windstorm [[H7307]] will burst forth. [[H1234]] 
12 Surely [[H2009]] when the wall [[H7023]] has fallen, [[H5307]] you will not [[H3808]] be asked, [[H559]] “Where [[H346]] is the whitewash [[H2915]] with which [[H834]] you covered it?”’ [[H2902]] 
13 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘In My wrath [[H2534]] I will release [[H1234]] a windstorm, [[H7307]] and in My anger [[H639]] torrents [[H7857]] of rain [[H1653]] and hail [[H68]] will fall [[H1961]] with destructive [[H3617]] fury. [[H2534]] 
14 I will tear down [[H2040]] the wall [[H7023]] you whitewashed [[H2902]] and level [[H5060]] it to [[H413]] the ground, [[H776]] so that its foundation [[H3247]] is exposed. [[H1540]] The city will fall, [[H5307]] and you will be destroyed [[H3615]] within it. [[H8432]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 And after I have vented [[H3615]] My wrath [[H2534]] against the wall [[H7023]] and against those who have whitewashed it, [[H2902]] I will say [[H559]] to you:  “The wall [[H7023]] is no more [[H369]] and neither [[H369]] are those who whitewashed [[H2902]] it— [[H853]] 
16 those prophets [[H5030]] of Israel [[H3478]] who prophesied [[H5012]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and saw [[H2374]] a vision [[H2377]] of peace [[H7965]] for her  when there was no [[H369]] peace, [[H7965]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.”’ [[H3069]] 
17 Now, [[H859]] O son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] your face [[H6440]] against [[H413]] the daughters [[H1323]] of your people [[H5971]] who prophesy [[H5012]] out of their own imagination. [[H3820]] Prophesy [[H5012]] against them [[H5921]] 
18 and tell them that [[H559]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Woe [[H1945]] to the women who sew [[H8609]] magic charms [[H3704]] on [[H5921]] their wrists [[H679]] and make [[H6213]] veils [[H4555]] for [[H5921]] the heads [[H7218]] of people of every [[H3605]] height, [[H6967]] in order to ensnare [[H6679]] their souls. [[H5315]] Will you ensnare [[H6679]] the souls [[H5315]] of My people [[H5971]] but preserve your own? [[H2421]] 
19 You have profaned [[H2490]] Me [[H853]] among [[H413]] My people [[H5971]] for handfuls [[H8168]] of barley [[H8184]] and scraps [[H6595]] of bread. [[H3899]] By lying [[H3576]] to My people [[H5971]] who would listen, [[H8085]] you have killed [[H4191]] those [[H5315]] who [[H834]] should not [[H3808]] have died [[H4191]] and spared [[H2421]] those [[H5315]] who [[H834]] should not [[H3808]] have lived. [[H2421]] 
20 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘See, [[H2005]] I am against [[H413]] the magic charms [[H3704]] with which [[H834]] you [[H859]] ensnare [[H6679]] souls [[H5315]] like birds, [[H6524]] and I will tear [[H7167]] them [[H853]] from [[H5921]] your arms. [[H2220]] I will free [[H7971]] the souls [[H5315]] you [[H859]] have ensnared. [[H6679]] 
21 I will also tear off [[H7167]] your veils [[H4555]] and deliver [[H5337]] My people [[H5971]] from your hands, [[H3027]] so that they will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] prey [[H4686]] in your hands. [[H3027]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
22 Because [[H3282]] you have disheartened [[H3512]] the righteous [[H6662]] with your lies, [[H8267]] even though I [[H589]] have caused them no grief, [[H3510]] and because you have encouraged [[H2388]] the wicked [[H7563]] not [[H1115]] to turn [[H7725]] from their evil [[H7451]] ways [[H1870]] to save their lives, [[H2421]] 
23 therefore [[H3651]] you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] see [[H2372]] false visions [[H7723]] or practice [[H7080]] divination. [[H7081]] I will deliver [[H5337]] My people [[H5971]] from your hands. [[H3027]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]]
