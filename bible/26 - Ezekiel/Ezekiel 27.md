[[Ezekiel 26|←]] • [[Ezekiel 28|→]]
1 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Now you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take up [[H5375]] a lament [[H7015]] for [[H5921]] Tyre. [[H6865]] 
3 Tell [[H559]] Tyre, [[H6865]] who dwells [[H3427]] at [[H5921]] the gateway [[H3996]] to the sea, [[H3220]] merchant [[H7402]] of the peoples [[H5971]] on [[H413]] many [[H7227]] coasts, [[H339]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘You [[H859]] have said, [[H559]] O Tyre, [[H6865]] “I [[H589]] am perfect [[H3632]] in beauty.” [[H3308]] 
4 Your borders [[H1366]] are in the heart [[H3820]] of the seas; [[H3220]] your builders [[H1129]] perfected [[H3634]] your beauty. [[H3308]] 
5 They constructed [[H1129]] all [[H3605]] your planking [[H3871]] with pine trees [[H1265]] from Senir. [[H8149]] They took [[H3947]] a cedar [[H730]] from Lebanon [[H3844]] to make [[H6213]] a mast [[H8650]] for you. [[H5921]] 
6 [Of] oaks [[H437]] from Bashan [[H1316]] they made [[H6213]] your oars; [[H4880]] of wood from the coasts [[H339]] of Cyprus [[H3794]] they made [[H6213]] your deck, [[H7175]] inlaid with ivory. [[H8127]] 
7 Of embroidered [[H7553]] fine linen [[H8336]] from Egypt, [[H4714]] they made [[H1961]] your sail, [[H4666]] which served [[H1961]] as your banner. [[H5251]] Of blue [[H8504]] and purple [[H713]] from the coasts [[H339]] of Elishah [[H473]] they made [[H1961]] your awning. [[H4374]] 
8 The men [[H3427]] of Sidon [[H6721]] and Arvad [[H719]] were [[H1961]] your oarsmen. [[H7751]] Your men of skill, [[H2450]] O Tyre, [[H6865]] were [there] [[H1961]] as your captains. [[H2259]] 
9 The elders [[H2205]] of Gebal [[H1380]] were aboard [[H1961]] as shipwrights, [[H2450]] repairing [[H2388]] your  leaks. [[H919]] All [[H3605]] the ships [[H591]] of the sea [[H3220]] and their sailors [[H4419]] came [[H1961]] alongside  to barter for [[H6148]] your goods. [[H4627]] 
10 Men [[H376]] of Persia, [[H6539]] Lydia, [[H3865]] and Put [[H6316]] served [[H1961]] as warriors [[H4421]] in your army. [[H2428]] They hung [[H8518]] shields [[H4043]] and helmets [[H3553]] on your walls;  they [[H1992]] gave [[H5414]] you splendor. [[H1926]] 
11 Men [[H1121]] of Arvad [[H719]] and Helech [[H2428]] manned [[H5921]] your walls [[H2346]] all around, [[H5439]] and the [men] of Gammad [[H1575]] were [[H1961]] in your towers. [[H4026]] They hung [[H8518]] their shields [[H7982]] all around [[H5439]] your walls; [[H2346]] they [[H1992]] perfected [[H3634]] your beauty. [[H3308]] 
12 Tarshish [was] [[H8659]] your merchant [[H5503]] because of your great [[H7230]] wealth of goods; [[H1952]] they exchanged [[H5414]] silver, [[H3701]] iron, [[H1270]] tin, [[H913]] and lead [[H5777]] for your wares. [[H5801]] 
13 Javan, [[H3120]] Tubal, [[H8422]] and Meshech [[H4902]] were your merchants. [[H7402]] They exchanged [[H5414]] slaves [[H5315]] and bronze [[H5178]] utensils [[H3627]] for your merchandise. [[H4627]] 
14 The men of Beth-togarmah [[H1004]] exchanged [[H5414]] horses, [[H5483]] war horses, [[H6571]] and mules [[H6505]] for your wares. [[H5801]] 
15 The men [[H1121]] of Dedan [[H1719]] [were] your clients; [[H7402]] many [[H7227]] coastlands [[H339]] were your market; [[H7725]] they paid you with [[H814]] ivory [[H8127]] tusks [[H7161]] and ebony. [[H1894]] 
16 Aram [[H758]] was your customer [[H5503]] because of the abundance [[H7230]] of your goods; [[H4639]] they exchanged [[H5414]] turquoise, [[H5306]] purple, [[H713]] embroidery, [[H7553]] fine linen, [[H948]] coral, [[H7215]] and rubies [[H3539]] for your wares. [[H5801]] 
17 Judah [[H3063]] and the land [[H776]] of Israel [[H3478]] traded with you; [[H7402]] they exchanged [[H5414]] wheat [[H2406]] from Minnith, [[H4511]] cakes [[H6436]] and honey, [[H1706]] oil [[H8081]] and balm [[H6875]] for your merchandise. [[H4627]] 
18 Because of your many [[H7230]] products [[H4639]] and your great [[H7230]] wealth of goods, [[H1952]] Damascus [[H1834]] traded with you [[H5503]] wine [[H3196]] from Helbon, [[H2463]] wool [[H6785]] from Zahar, [[H6713]] 
19 and casks of wine [[H1835]] from Izal [[H235]] for your wares. [[H5801]] Wrought [[H6219]] iron, [[H1270]] cassia, [[H6916]] and sweet cane [[H7070]] were exchanged [[H5414]] for your merchandise. [[H4627]] 
20 Dedan [[H1719]] was your merchant [[H7402]] in saddlecloths [[H899]] for riding. [[H7396]] 
21 Arabia [[H6152]] and all [[H3605]] the princes [[H5387]] of Kedar [[H6938]] were your customers, [[H5503]] trading [[H5503]] in lambs, [[H3733]] rams, [[H352]] and goats. [[H6260]] 
22 The merchants [[H7402]] of Sheba [[H7614]] and Raamah [[H7484]] traded with you; [[H7402]] for your wares [[H5801]] they exchanged [[H5414]] gold, [[H2091]] the finest [[H7218]] of all [[H3605]] spices, [[H1314]] and [[H3605]] precious [[H3368]] stones. [[H68]] 
23 Haran, [[H2771]] Canneh, [[H3656]] and Eden, [[H5729]] and the merchants [[H7402]] of Sheba, [[H7614]] Asshur, [[H804]] and Chilmad [[H3638]] traded with you. [[H7402]] 
24 In your marketplace [[H4819]] they [[H1992]] traded [[H7402]] with you fine [[H4360]] garments [[H1545]] of blue [[H8504]] and embroidered work, [[H7553]] and multicolored [[H1264]] rugs, [[H1595]] bound [[H2280]] and secured [[H729]] with cords. [[H2256]] 
25 The ships [[H591]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] carried [[H7788]] your merchandise. [[H4627]] And you were filled [[H4390]] with heavy cargo [[H3513]] in the heart [[H3820]] of the sea. [[H3220]] 
26 Your oarsmen [[H7751]] have brought you [[H935]] onto the high [[H7227]] seas, [[H4325]] but the east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] will shatter you [[H7665]] in the heart [[H3820]] of the sea. [[H3220]] 
27 Your wealth, [[H1952]] wares, [[H5801]] and goods, [[H4627]] your sailors, [[H4419]] captains, [[H2259]] and shipwrights, [[H2388]] your merchants [[H6148]] and all [[H3605]] the warriors [[H376]] within you, [[H4421]] with all [[H3605]] the other people on board, [[H6951]] will sink [[H5307]] into the heart [[H3820]] of the sea [[H3220]] on the day [[H3117]] of your downfall. [[H4658]] 
28 The countryside [[H4054]] will shake [[H7493]] when your sailors [[H2259]] cry out. [[H2201]] 
29 All [[H3605]] who handle [[H8610]] the oars [[H4880]] will abandon [[H3381]] their ships. [[H591]] The sailors [[H4419]] and all [[H3605]] the captains [[H2259]] of the sea [[H3220]] will stand [[H5975]] on [[H413]] the shore. [[H776]] 
30 They will raise [[H8085]] their voices [[H6963]] for you [[H5921]] and cry out [[H2199]] bitterly. [[H4751]] They will throw [[H5927]] dust [[H6083]] on [[H5921]] their heads [[H7218]] and roll [[H6428]] in ashes. [[H665]] 
31 They will shave their heads [[H7139]] for you [[H413]] and wrap themselves in [[H2296]] sackcloth. [[H8242]] They will weep [[H1058]] over you [[H413]] with anguish [[H4751]] of soul [[H5315]] and bitter [[H4751]] mourning. [[H4553]] 
32 As they wail [[H5204]] and mourn [[H6969]] over you, [[H5921]] they will take up [[H5375]] a lament [[H7015]] for you: [[H413]] Who [[H4310]] was ever like Tyre, [[H6865]] silenced [[H1822]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the sea? [[H3220]] 
33 When your merchandise [[H5801]] went out [[H3318]] to sea, [[H3220]] you satisfied [[H7646]] many [[H7227]] nations. [[H5971]] You enriched [[H6238]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] with your abundant [[H7230]] wealth [[H1952]] and goods. [[H4627]] 
34 Now [[H6256]] you are shattered [[H7665]] by the seas [[H3220]] in the depths [[H4615]] of the waters; [[H4325]] your goods [[H4627]] and the people [[H6951]] among you [[H8432]] have gone down with you. [[H5307]] 
35 All [[H3605]] the people [[H3427]] of the coastlands [[H339]] are appalled [[H8074]] over you. [[H5921]] Their kings [[H4428]] shudder with fear; [[H8175]] their faces [[H6440]] are contorted. [[H7481]] 
36 Those who trade [[H5503]] among the nations [[H5971]] hiss [[H8319]] at you; [[H5921]] you have come [[H1961]] to a horrible end [[H1091]] and will be no more.’” [[H369]]
