# Ezekiel 4
[[Ezekiel 3|←]] • [[Ezekiel 5|→]]
1 Now you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take [[H3947]] a brick, [[H3843]] place [[H5414]] it [[H853]] before you, [[H6440]] and draw [[H2710]] on it [[H5921]] the city [[H5892]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
2 Then lay [[H5414]] siege [[H4692]] against it: [[H5921]] Construct [[H1129]] a siege wall, [[H1785]] build [[H8210]] a ramp [[H5550]] to it, [[H5921]] set up [[H5414]] camps [[H4264]] against it, [[H5921]] and place [[H7760]] battering rams [[H3733]] around it [[H5921]] on all sides. [[H5439]] 
3 Then [[H859]] take [[H3947]] an iron [[H1270]] plate [[H4227]] and set it up [[H5414]] as an iron [[H1270]] wall [[H7023]] between yourself [[H996]] and the city. [[H5892]] Turn [[H3559]] your face [[H6440]] toward it [[H413]] so that it is [[H1961]] under siege, [[H4692]] and besiege it. [[H6696]] This [[H1931]] will be a sign [[H226]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
4 Then lie down [[H7901]] on [[H5921]] your left [[H8042]] side [[H6654]] and place [[H7760]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] upon yourself. [[H5921]] You are to bear [[H5375]] their iniquity [[H5771]] for the number [[H4557]] of days [[H3117]] you lie on your side. [[H7901]] 
5 For I [[H589]] have assigned [[H5414]] you the years [[H8141]] of their iniquity [[H5771]] according to the number [[H4557]] of days [[H3117]] you lie down, 390 [[H7969]] days; [[H3117]] so you will bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
6 When you have completed [[H3615]] these days, [[H428]] lie down [[H7901]] again, [[H8145]] but on [[H5921]] your right [[H3227]] side, [[H6654]] and bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]] I have assigned [[H5414]] to you  40 [[H705]] days, [[H3117]] a day [[H3117]] for each year. [[H8141]] 
7 You must turn [[H3559]] your face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] the siege [[H4692]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] with your arm [[H2220]] bared, [[H2834]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against it. [[H5921]] 
8 Now behold, [[H2009]] I will tie you up [[H5414]] with ropes [[H5688]] so you cannot [[H3808]] turn [[H2015]] from side [[H6654]] to [[H413]] side [[H6654]] until [[H5704]] you have finished [[H3615]] the days [[H3117]] of your siege. [[H4692]] 
9 But take [[H3947]] wheat, [[H2406]] barley, [[H8184]] beans, [[H6321]] lentils, [[H5742]] millet, [[H1764]] and spelt; [[H3698]] put [[H5414]] them in a single [[H259]] container [[H3627]] and make [[H6213]] them into bread [[H3899]] for yourself.  [This is what] you are to eat [[H398]] during the [[H4557]] 390 [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] you lie [[H7901]] on [[H5921]] your side. [[H6654]] 
10 You are to weigh out [[H4946]] twenty [[H6242]] shekels [[H8255]] of food [[H3978]] to eat [[H398]] each day, [[H3117]] and you are to eat it [[H398]] at set times. [[H6256]] 
11 You are also to measure out [[H4884]] a sixth [[H8345]] of a hin [[H1969]] of water [[H4325]] to drink, [[H8354]] and you are to drink it [[H8354]] at set times. [[H6256]] 
12 And you shall eat [[H398]] [the food] [[H1931]] as you would a barley [[H8184]] cake, [[H5692]] after you bake [[H5746]] it over dried human [[H120]] excrement [[H1561]] in the sight [of the people].” [[H5869]] 
13 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “This is how [[H3602]] the Israelites [[H1121]] will eat [[H398]] their defiled [[H2931]] bread [[H3899]] among the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] I will banish them.” [[H5080]] 
14 “Ah, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD,” [[H3069]] I said, [[H559]] “I [[H5315]] have never [[H3808]] defiled myself. [[H2930]] From my youth [[H5271]] until [[H5704]] now [[H6258]] I have not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] anything found dead [[H5038]] or mauled by wild beasts. [[H2966]] No [[H3808]] unclean [[H6292]] meat [[H1320]] has ever entered [[H935]] my mouth.” [[H6310]] 
15 “Look,” [[H7200]] He replied, [[H559]] “I will let [[H5414]] you use cow [[H1241]] dung [[H6832]] instead of [[H8478]] human [[H120]] excrement, [[H1561]] and you may bake [[H6213]] your bread [[H3899]] over that.” [[H5921]] 
16 Then He told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] I am going to cut off [[H7665]] the supply [[H4294]] of food [[H3899]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] They will anxiously [[H1674]] eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] rationed by weight, [[H4948]] and in despair [[H8078]] they will drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] by measure. [[H4884]] 
17 So [[H4616]] they will lack [[H2637]] food [[H3899]] and water; [[H4325]] they will be appalled [[H8074]] [over the sight of] one [[H376]] another [[H251]] wasting away [[H4743]] in their iniquity. [[H5771]]
