1 “Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “eat [[H398]] what [[H834]] you find here. [[H4672]] Eat [[H398]] this [[H2063]] scroll, [[H4039]] then go [[H1980]] and speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel.” [[H3478]] 
2 So I opened [[H6605]] my mouth, [[H6310]] and He fed [[H398]] me [[H853]] the scroll. [[H4039]] 
3 “Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “eat [[H398]] and fill [[H4390]] your stomach [[H4578]] with this [[H2063]] scroll [[H4039]] I [[H589]] am giving you.” [[H5414]] So I ate, [[H398]] and it was [[H1961]] as sweet [[H4966]] as honey [[H1706]] in my mouth. [[H6310]] 
4 Then He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] go now [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and speak [[H1696]] My words [[H1697]] to them. [[H413]] 
5 For [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are not [[H3808]] being sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] a people [[H5971]] of unfamiliar [[H6012]] speech [[H8193]] or difficult [[H3515]] language, [[H3956]] but to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel— [[H3478]] 
6 not [[H3808]] to [[H413]] many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] of unfamiliar [[H6012]] speech [[H8193]] or difficult [[H3515]] language, [[H3956]] whose [[H834]] words [[H1697]] you cannot [[H3808]] understand. [[H8085]] Surely [[H518]] if I had sent you [[H7971]] to them, [[H413]] they [[H1992]] would have listened [[H8085]] to you. [[H413]] 
7 But the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] will be unwilling [[H14]] to listen [[H8085]] to you, [[H413]] since [[H3588]] they are unwilling [[H14]] to listen [[H8085]] to Me. [[H413]] For [[H3588]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] is stubborn [[H2389]] and obstinate. [[H7186]] 
8 Behold, [[H2009]] I will make [[H5414]] your face [[H6440]] as hard [[H2389]] as [[H5980]] their faces, [[H6440]] and your forehead [[H4696]] as hard [[H2389]] as [[H5980]] their foreheads. [[H4696]] 
9 I will make [[H5414]] your forehead [[H4696]] like a diamond, [[H8068]] harder [[H2389]] than flint. [[H6864]] Do not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them [[H853]] [or] [[H3808]] dismayed [[H2865]] at their presence, [[H6440]] even though [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are a rebellious [[H4805]] house.” [[H1004]] 
10 “Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] He added, [[H559]] “listen carefully [[H241]] to all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] I speak [[H1696]] to you, [[H413]] and take them [[H3947]] to heart. [[H3824]] 
11 Go [[H935]] to [[H413]] your people, [[H1121]] the exiles; [[H1473]] speak [[H1696]] to them [[H413]] and tell [[H559]] them, [[H413]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says,’ [[H559]] whether [[H518]] they listen [[H8085]] or [[H518]] refuse to listen.” [[H2308]] 
12 Then the Spirit [[H7307]] lifted me up, [[H5375]] and I heard [[H8085]] a great [[H1419]] rumbling [[H7494]] sound [[H6963]] behind me— [[H310]] blessed be [[H1288]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in His dwelling place!— [[H4725]] 
13 the sound [[H6963]] of the wings [[H3671]] of the living creatures [[H2416]] brushing [[H5401]] against [[H413]] one [[H802]] another [[H269]] and the sound [[H6963]] of the wheels [[H212]] beside them, [[H5980]] a great [[H1419]] rumbling [[H7494]] sound. [[H6963]] 
14 So the Spirit [[H7307]] lifted me up [[H5375]] and took me away, [[H3947]] and I went [[H1980]] in bitterness [[H4751]] and in the anger [[H2534]] of my spirit, [[H7307]] with the strong [[H2388]] hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] upon me. [[H5921]] 
15 I came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the exiles [[H1473]] at Tel-abib [[H8512]] who dwelt [[H3427]] by [[H413]] the River [[H5104]] Kebar. [[H3529]] And for seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] I sat [[H834]] where [[H8033]] they sat [[H3427]] and remained [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] among them, [[H8432]] overwhelmed. [[H8074]] 
16 At the end [[H7097]] of seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
17 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] I have made [[H5414]] you a watchman [[H6822]] for the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Whenever you hear [[H8085]] a word [[H1697]] from [[H4480]] My mouth, [[H6310]] give them a warning [[H2094]] from Me. [[H853]] 
18 If I say [[H559]] to the wicked man, [[H7563]] ‘You will surely die,’ [[H4191]] but you do not [[H3808]] warn him [[H2094]] [or] [[H3808]] speak out [[H1696]] to warn [[H2094]] him [[H7563]] from his wicked [[H7563]] way [[H1870]] to save his life, [[H2421]] that [[H1931]] wicked man [[H7563]] will die [[H4191]] in his iniquity, [[H5771]] and I will hold you [[H3027]] responsible for [[H1245]] his blood. [[H1818]] 
19 But if [[H3588]] you [[H859]] warn [[H2094]] a wicked man [[H7563]] and he does not [[H3808]] turn [[H7725]] from his wickedness [[H7562]] and his wicked [[H7563]] way, [[H1870]] he [[H1931]] will die [[H4191]] in his iniquity, [[H5771]] but you [[H859]] will have saved [[H5337]] yourself. [[H5315]] 
20 Now if a righteous man [[H6662]] turns [[H7725]] from his righteousness [[H6664]] and commits [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] and I put [[H5414]] a stumbling block [[H4383]] before him, [[H6440]] he [[H1931]] will die. [[H4191]] If [[H3588]] you did not [[H3808]] warn him, [[H2094]] he will die [[H4191]] in his sin, [[H2403]] and the righteous acts [[H6666]] he did [[H6213]] will not [[H3808]] be remembered. [[H2142]] And I will hold you [[H3027]] responsible for [[H1245]] his blood. [[H1818]] 
21 But if [[H3588]] you [[H859]] warn [[H2094]] the righteous man [[H6662]] not [[H1115]] to sin, [[H2398]] and he [[H1931]] does not [[H3808]] sin, [[H2398]] he will indeed live [[H2421]] because [[H3588]] he heeded your warning, [[H2094]] and you [[H859]] will have saved [[H5337]] yourself.” [[H5315]] 
22 And there [[H8033]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] upon me, [[H5921]] and He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Get up, [[H6965]] go out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the plain, [[H1237]] and there [[H8033]] I will speak [[H1696]] with you.” [[H854]] 
23 So I got up [[H6965]] and went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the plain, [[H1237]] and behold, [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was present [[H5975]] there, [[H8033]] like the glory [[H3519]] I had seen [[H7200]] by [[H5921]] the River [[H5104]] Kebar, [[H3529]] and I fell [[H5307]] facedown. [[H5921]] 
24 Then the Spirit [[H7307]] entered [[H935]] me  and set [[H5975]] me on [[H5921]] my feet. [[H7272]] He spoke [[H1696]] with [[H854]] me and said: [[H559]] “Go, [[H935]] shut yourself [[H5462]] inside [[H8432]] your house. [[H1004]] 
25 And you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] they will tie [[H5414]] with ropes, [[H5688]] and you will be bound [[H631]] so that you cannot [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] among [the people]. [[H8432]] 
26 I will make your tongue [[H3956]] stick [[H1692]] to [[H413]] the roof of your mouth, [[H2441]] and you will be silent [[H481]] and unable [[H3808]] to rebuke them, [[H3198]] though [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]] 
27 But when I speak [[H1696]] with you, [[H854]] I will open [[H6605]] your mouth, [[H6310]] and you are to tell [[H559]] them, [[H413]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says.’ [[H559]] Whoever listens, [[H8085]] let him listen; [[H8085]] and whoever refuses, [[H2308]] let him refuse; [[H2310]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]]
