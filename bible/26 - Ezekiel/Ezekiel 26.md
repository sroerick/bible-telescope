# Ezekiel 26
[[Ezekiel 25|←]] • [[Ezekiel 27|→]]
1 In the eleventh [month of the twelfth] [[H6249]] year, [[H8141]] on the first [[H259]] day of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] because [[H3282]] Tyre [[H6865]] has said [[H559]] of [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] ‘Aha! [[H1889]] The gate [[H1817]] to the nations [[H5971]] is broken; [[H7665]] it has swung open [[H5437]] to me; [[H413]] now that she lies in ruins [[H2717]] I will be filled,’ [[H4390]] 
3 therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] O Tyre, [[H6865]] [I am] against you; [[H5921]] and I will raise up [[H5927]] many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] against you, [[H5921]] as the sea [[H3220]] brings up [[H5927]] its waves. [[H1530]] 
4 They will destroy [[H7843]] the walls [[H2346]] of Tyre [[H6865]] and demolish [[H2040]] her towers. [[H4026]] I will scrape [[H5500]] the soil [[H6083]] from her [[H4480]] and make [[H5414]] her [[H853]] a bare [[H6706]] rock. [[H5553]] 
5 She will become [[H1961]] a place [[H8432]] to spread [[H4894]] nets [[H2764]] in the sea, [[H3220]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have spoken, [[H1696]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] She will become [[H1961]] plunder [[H957]] for the nations, [[H1471]] 
6 and the villages [[H1323]] on her mainland [[H7704]] will be slain [[H2026]] by the sword. [[H2719]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]] 
7 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] against [[H413]] Tyre [[H6865]] from the north [[H6828]] King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] of Babylon, [[H894]] king [[H4428]] of kings, [[H4428]] with horses [[H5483]] and chariots, [[H7393]] with cavalry [[H6571]] and a great [[H7227]] company [[H6951]] of troops. [[H5971]] 
8 He will slaughter [[H2026]] the villages [[H1323]] of your mainland [[H7704]] with the sword; [[H2719]] he will set up [[H5414]] siege works [[H1785]] against you, [[H5921]] build [[H8210]] a ramp to your walls, [[H5550]] and raise [[H6965]] his shields [[H6793]] against you. [[H5921]] 
9 He will direct [[H5414]] the blows [[H4239]] of his battering rams [[H6904]] against your walls [[H2346]] and tear down [[H5422]] your towers [[H4026]] with his axes. [[H2719]] 
10 His multitude [[H8229]] of horses [[H5483]] will cover you [[H3680]] in their dust. [[H80]] When he enters [[H935]] your gates [[H8179]] as an army entering [[H3996]] a breached [[H1234]] city, [[H5892]] your walls [[H2346]] will shake [[H7493]] from the noise [[H6963]] of cavalry, [[H6571]] wagons, [[H1534]] and chariots. [[H7393]] 
11 The hooves [[H6541]] of his horses [[H5483]] will trample [[H7429]] all [[H3605]] your streets. [[H2351]] He will slaughter [[H2026]] your people [[H5971]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and your mighty [[H5797]] pillars [[H4676]] will fall [[H3381]] to the ground. [[H776]] 
12 They will plunder [[H7997]] your wealth [[H2428]] and pillage [[H962]] your merchandise. [[H7404]] They will demolish [[H2040]] your walls, [[H2346]] tear down [[H5422]] your beautiful [[H2532]] homes, [[H1004]] and throw [[H7760]] your stones [[H68]] and timber [[H6086]] and soil [[H6083]] into [[H8432]] the water. [[H4325]] 
13 So I will silence [[H7673]] the sound [[H1995]] of your songs, [[H7892]] and the music [[H6963]] of your lyres [[H3658]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be heard. [[H8085]] 
14 I will make you [[H5414]] a bare [[H6706]] rock, [[H5553]] and you will become [[H1961]] a place to spread [[H4894]] the fishing nets. [[H2764]] You will never [[H3808]] be rebuilt, [[H1129]] for [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken, [[H1696]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’ [[H3069]] 
15 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] to Tyre: [[H6865]] ‘Will not [[H3808]] the coasts and islands [[H339]] quake [[H7493]] at the sound [[H6963]] of your downfall, [[H4658]] when the wounded [[H2491]] groan [[H602]] at the slaughter [[H2027]] in your midst? [[H8432]] 
16 All [[H3605]] the princes [[H5387]] of the sea [[H3220]] will descend [[H3381]] from [[H5921]] their thrones, [[H3678]] remove [[H5493]] their robes, [[H4598]] and strip off [[H6584]] their embroidered [[H7553]] garments. [[H899]] Clothed [[H3847]] with terror, [[H2731]] they will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the ground, [[H776]] trembling [[H2729]] [every] moment, [[H7281]] appalled [[H8074]] over you. [[H5921]] 
17 Then they will lament [[H5375]] for you, [[H5921]] saying, [[H559]] “How [[H349]] you have perished, [[H6]] O city [[H5892]] of renown, [[H1984]] inhabited [[H3427]] by seafaring [men]! [[H3220]] She who [[H834]] was [[H1961]] powerful [[H2389]] on the sea, [[H3220]] along with her people, [[H3427]] who [[H834]] brought [[H5414]] terror [[H2851]] to all [[H3605]] who lived there. [[H3427]] 
18 Now [[H6258]] the coastlands [[H339]] tremble [[H2729]] on the day [[H3117]] of your downfall; [[H4658]] the islands [[H339]] in the sea [[H3220]] are dismayed [[H926]] by your demise.”’ [[H3318]] 
19 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘When I make [[H5414]] you [[H853]] a desolate [[H2717]] city [[H5892]] like other deserted [[H3808]] cities, [[H5892]] when I raise up [[H5927]] the deep [[H8415]] against you [[H5921]] so that the mighty [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] cover you, [[H3680]] 
20 then I will bring you down [[H3381]] with [[H854]] those who descend [[H3381]] to the Pit, [[H953]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] of antiquity. [[H5769]] I will make you dwell [[H3427]] in the earth [[H776]] below [[H8482]] like the ancient [[H5769]] ruins, [[H2723]] with [[H854]] those who descend [[H3381]] to the Pit, [[H953]] so that [[H4616]] you will no [[H3808]] longer be inhabited [[H3427]] or set [[H5414]] in splendor [[H6643]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]] 
21 I will make [[H5414]] you an object of horror, [[H1091]] and you will be no more. [[H369]] You will be sought, [[H1245]] but will never [[H3808]] be found, [[H4672]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]
