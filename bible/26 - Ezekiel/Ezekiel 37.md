# Ezekiel 37
[[Ezekiel 36|←]] • [[Ezekiel 38|→]]
1 The hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] upon me, [[H5921]] and He brought me out [[H3318]] by His [[H3068]] Spirit [[H7307]] and set me down [[H5117]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the valley; [[H1237]] it [[H1931]] was full of [[H4392]] bones. [[H6106]] 
2 He led me [[H5674]] all [[H5439]] around [[H5439]] among them, [[H5921]] and I saw [[H2009]] a great [[H3966]] many [bones] [[H7227]] on [[H5921]] the floor [[H6440]] of the valley, [[H1237]] and indeed [[H2009]] they were very [[H3966]] dry. [[H3002]] 
3 Then He asked [[H559]] me, [[H413]] “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] can these [[H428]] bones [[H6106]] live?” [[H2421]] “O Lord [[H136]] GOD,” [[H3069]] I replied, [[H559]] “only You [[H859]] know.” [[H3045]] 
4 And He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Prophesy [[H5012]] concerning [[H5921]] these [[H428]] bones [[H6106]] and tell [[H559]] them: [[H413]] ‘Dry [[H3002]] bones, [[H6106]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD! [[H3068]] 
5 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] to these [[H428]] bones: [[H6106]] I [[H589]] will cause breath [[H7307]] to enter you, [[H935]] and you will live. [[H2421]] 
6 I will attach [[H5414]] tendons [[H1517]] to you [[H5921]] and make flesh [[H1320]] grow [[H5927]] upon you [[H5921]] and cover [[H7159]] you [[H5921]] with skin. [[H5785]] I will put [[H5414]] breath [[H7307]] within you  so that you will come to life. [[H2421]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]] 
7 So I prophesied [[H5012]] as [[H834]] I had been commanded. [[H6680]] And as I prophesied, [[H5012]] there was [[H1961]] suddenly [[H2009]] a noise, [[H6963]] a rattling sound, [[H7494]] and the bones [[H6106]] came together, [[H7126]] bone [[H6106]] to [[H413]] bone. [[H6106]] 
8 As I looked on, [[H7200]] tendons [[H1517]] appeared [[H2009]] on them, [[H5921]] flesh [[H1320]] grew, [[H5927]] and skin [[H5785]] covered them; [[H7159]] but there was no [[H369]] breath in them. [[H7307]] 
9 Then He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Prophesy [[H5012]] to [[H413]] the breath; [[H7307]] prophesy, [[H5012]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] and tell [[H559]] it [[H7307]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Come [[H935]] from the four [[H702]] winds, [[H7307]] O breath, [[H7307]] and breathe [[H5301]] into these [[H428]] slain, [[H2026]] so that they may live! [[H2421]] 
10 So I prophesied [[H5012]] as [[H834]] He commanded me, [[H6680]] and the breath [[H7307]] entered them, [[H935]] and they came to life [[H2421]] and stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] their feet— [[H7272]] a vast [[H1419]] army. [[H2428]] 
11 Then He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] these [[H428]] bones [[H6106]] are the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Look, [[H2009]] they [[H1992]] are saying, [[H559]] ‘Our bones [[H6106]] are dried up, [[H3001]] and our hope [[H8615]] has perished; [[H6]] we are cut off.’ [[H1504]] 
12 Therefore [[H3651]] prophesy [[H5012]] and tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘O [[H2009]] My people, [[H5971]] I [[H589]] will open [[H6605]] your graves [[H6913]] and bring you up [[H5927]] from [[H853]] them, [[H6913]] and I will bring you back [[H935]] to [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
13 Then you, My people, [[H5971]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] when I open [[H6605]] your graves [[H6913]] and bring you up [[H5927]] from them. [[H6913]] 
14 I will put [[H5414]] My Spirit [[H7307]] in you  and you will live, [[H2421]] and I will settle [[H3240]] you [[H853]] in [[H5921]] your own land. [[H127]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken, [[H1696]] and I will do it, [[H6213]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD.’” [[H3068]] 
15 Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
16 “And you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take [[H3947]] a single [[H259]] stick [[H6086]] and write [[H3789]] on it: [[H5921]] ‘Belonging to Judah [[H3063]] and to the Israelites [[H1121]] associated with him.’ [[H2270]] Then take [[H3947]] another [[H259]] stick [[H6086]] and write [[H3789]] on it: [[H5921]] ‘Belonging to Joseph— [[H3130]] the stick [[H6086]] of Ephraim— [[H669]] and to all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] associated with him.’ [[H2270]] 
17 Then join [[H7126]] them together [[H259]] into one [[H259]] stick, [[H6086]] so that they become [[H1961]] one [[H259]] in your hand. [[H3027]] 
18 When [[H834]] your people [[H1121]] ask [[H559]] you, [[H413]] ‘Won't [[H3808]] you explain [[H5046]] to us  what [[H4100]] you [mean] by  these?’ [[H428]] 
19 you are to tell [[H1696]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I [[H589]] will take [[H3947]] the stick [[H6086]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] which [[H834]] is in the hand [[H3027]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] associated with him, [[H2270]] and I will put [[H5414]] them [[H853]] together with [[H5921]] the stick [[H6086]] of Judah. [[H3063]] I will make [[H6213]] them into a single [[H259]] stick, [[H6086]] and they will become [[H1961]] one [[H259]] in My hand. [[H3027]] 
20 When the sticks [[H6086]] on which [[H834]] you write [[H3789]] are [[H1961]] in your hand [[H3027]] and in full view of the people, [[H5869]] 
21 you are to tell them [[H1696]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I [[H589]] will take [[H3947]] the Israelites [[H1121]] out of [[H996]] the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] they have gone, [[H1980]] and I will gather [[H6908]] them from [[H853]] all around [[H5439]] and bring [[H935]] them into [[H413]] their own land. [[H127]] 
22 I will make [[H6213]] them one [[H259]] nation [[H1471]] in the land, [[H776]] on the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and one [[H259]] king [[H4428]] will rule over [[H1961]] all of them. [[H3605]] Then they will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] nations [[H1471]] and will never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] be divided [[H2673]] into two [[H8147]] kingdoms. [[H4467]] 
23 They will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] defile themselves [[H2930]] with their idols [[H1544]] or detestable images, [[H8251]] or with any [[H3605]] of their transgressions. [[H6588]] I will deliver [[H3467]] them [[H853]] from all [[H3605]] their apostasies [[H4186]] by which [[H834]] they sinned, [[H2398]] and I will cleanse them. [[H2891]] Then they will be [[H1961]] My people, [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]] 
24 My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] will be king [[H4428]] over them, [[H5921]] and there will be [[H1961]] one [[H259]] shepherd [[H7462]] for all of them. [[H3605]] They will follow [[H1980]] My ordinances [[H4941]] and keep [[H8104]] and observe [[H6213]] My statutes. [[H2708]] 
25 They will live [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] to My servant [[H5650]] Jacob, [[H3290]] where [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] lived. [[H3427]] They will live [[H3427]] there [[H5921]] forever [[H5704]] with their children [[H1121]] and grandchildren, [[H1121]] and My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] will be their prince forever. [[H5387]] 
26 And I will make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] of peace [[H7965]] with them;  it will be [[H1961]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant. [[H1285]] I will establish [[H5414]] and multiply [[H7235]] them, [[H853]] and I will set [[H5414]] My sanctuary [[H4720]] among them [[H8432]] forever. [[H5769]] 
27 My dwelling place [[H4908]] will be [[H1961]] with them; [[H5921]] I will be [[H1961]] their God, [[H430]] and they [[H1992]] will be [[H1961]] My people. [[H5971]] 
28 Then the nations [[H1471]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the LORD [[H3068]] sanctify [[H6942]] Israel, [[H3478]] when My sanctuary [[H4720]] is [[H1961]] among them [[H8432]] forever.’” [[H5769]]
