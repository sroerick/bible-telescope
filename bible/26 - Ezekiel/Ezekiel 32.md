[[Ezekiel 31|←]] • [[Ezekiel 33|→]]
1 In the twelfth [[H8147]] year, [[H8141]] in the twelfth [[H8147]] month, [[H2320]] on the first [[H259]] day, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take up [[H5375]] a lament [[H7015]] for [[H5921]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and say [[H559]] to him: [[H413]] ‘You are like [[H1819]] a lion [[H3715]] among the nations; [[H1471]] you [[H859]] are like a monster [[H8577]] in the seas. [[H3220]] You thrash about [[H1518]] in your rivers, [[H5104]] churning up [[H1804]] the waters [[H4325]] with your feet [[H7272]] and muddying [[H7515]] the streams. [[H5104]] 
3 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will spread [[H6566]] My net [[H7568]] over you [[H5921]] with a company [[H6951]] of many [[H7227]] peoples, [[H5971]] and they will draw you up [[H5927]] in My net. [[H2764]] 
4 I will abandon [[H5203]] you on the land [[H776]] and hurl you [[H2904]] into [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] field. [[H7704]] I will cause all [[H3605]] the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] to settle [[H7931]] upon you [[H5921]] and all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the earth [[H776]] to eat their fill [[H7646]] of you. [[H4480]] 
5 I will put [[H5414]] your flesh [[H1320]] on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] and fill [[H4390]] the valleys [[H1516]] with your remains. [[H7419]] 
6 I will drench [[H8248]] the land [[H776]] with the flow [[H6824]] of [[H4480]] your blood, [[H1818]] all the way to [[H413]] the mountains— [[H2022]] the ravines [[H650]] will be filled. [[H4390]] 
7 When I extinguish you, [[H3518]] I will cover [[H3680]] the heavens [[H8064]] and darken [[H6937]] their stars. [[H3556]] I will cover [[H3680]] the sun [[H8121]] with a cloud, [[H6051]] and the moon [[H3394]] will not [[H3808]] give its light. [[H215]] 
8 All [[H3605]] the shining [[H3974]] lights [[H216]] in the heavens [[H8064]] I will darken [[H6937]] over you, [[H5921]] and I will bring [[H5414]] darkness [[H2822]] upon [[H5921]] your land,’ [[H776]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
9 ‘I will trouble [[H3707]] the hearts [[H3820]] of many [[H7227]] peoples, [[H5971]] when I bring about [[H935]] your destruction [[H7667]] among the nations, [[H1471]] in [[H5921]] countries [[H776]] you do not [[H3808]] know. [[H3045]] 
10 I will cause many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] to be appalled [[H8074]] over you, [[H5921]] and their kings [[H4428]] will shudder with horror [[H8175]] because of you [[H5921]] when I brandish [[H5774]] My sword [[H2719]] before [[H5921]] them. [[H6440]] On the day [[H3117]] of your downfall [[H4658]] each of them [[H376]] will tremble [[H2729]] every moment [[H7281]] for his life.’ [[H5315]] 
11 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘The sword [[H2719]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] will come against you! [[H935]] 
12 I will make your hordes [[H1995]] fall [[H5307]] by the swords [[H2719]] of the mighty, [[H1368]] the most ruthless [[H6184]] of all [[H3605]] nations. [[H1471]] They will ravage [[H7703]] the pride [[H1347]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and all [[H3605]] her multitudes [[H1995]] will be destroyed. [[H8045]] 
13 I will slaughter [[H6]] all [[H3605]] her cattle [[H929]] beside [[H5921]] the abundant [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]] No [[H3808]] human [[H120]] foot [[H7272]] will muddy [[H1804]] them again, [[H5750]] and no [[H3808]] cattle [[H929]] hooves [[H6541]] will disturb them. [[H1804]] 
14 Then [[H227]] I will let her waters [[H4325]] settle [[H8257]] and will make her rivers [[H5104]] flow [[H1980]] like oil, [[H8081]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
15 When I make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] a desolation [[H8077]] and empty [[H8074]] [it] [[H776]] of all that filled it, [[H4393]] when I strike down [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] who live there, [[H3427]] then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]] 
16 This [[H1931]] is the lament [[H7015]] they will chant for her; [[H6969]] the daughters [[H1323]] of the nations [[H1471]] will chant it. [[H6969]] Over [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4714]] and all [[H3605]] her multitudes [[H1995]] they will chant it, [[H6969]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.” [[H3069]] 
17 In the twelfth [[H8147]] year, [[H8141]] on the fifteenth [[H2568]] day of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
18 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] wail [[H5091]] for [[H5921]] the multitudes [[H1995]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and consign [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the depths [[H8482]] of the earth [[H776]] both her [[H853]] and the daughters [[H1323]] of the mighty [[H117]] nations, [[H1471]] with [[H854]] those who descend [[H3381]] to the Pit: [[H953]] 
19 ‘Whom [[H4310]] do you surpass in beauty? [[H5276]] Go down [[H3381]] and be placed [[H7901]] with [[H854]] the uncircumcised! [[H6189]] 
20 They will fall [[H5307]] among [[H8432]] those slain [[H2491]] by the sword. [[H2719]] The sword [[H2719]] is appointed! [[H5414]] They drag her away [[H4900]] along with all [[H3605]] her multitudes. [[H1995]] 
21 Mighty [[H1368]] chiefs [[H410]] will speak [[H1696]] from the midst [[H8432]] of Sheol [[H7585]] about [Egypt] [[H854]] and her allies: [[H5826]] “They have come down [[H3381]] and lie [[H7901]] with the uncircumcised, [[H6189]] with those slain [[H2491]] by the sword.” [[H2719]] 
22 Assyria [[H804]] is there [[H8033]] with her whole [[H3605]] company; [[H6951]] her graves [[H6913]] are all around her. [[H5439]] All of them [[H3605]] are slain, [[H2491]] fallen [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]] 
23 Her [[H834]] graves [[H6913]] are set [[H5414]] in the depths [[H3411]] of the Pit, [[H953]] and her company [[H6951]] is [[H1961]] all around [[H5439]] her grave. [[H6900]] All [[H3605]] of them are slain, [[H2491]] fallen [[H5307]] by the sword— [[H2719]] those who [[H834]] once spread [[H5414]] terror [[H2851]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]] 
24 Elam [[H5867]] is there [[H8033]] with all [[H3605]] her multitudes [[H1995]] around [[H5439]] her grave. [[H6900]] All [[H3605]] of them are slain, [[H2491]] fallen [[H5307]] by the sword— [[H2719]] those [[H834]] who went down [[H3381]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] to [[H413]] the earth [[H776]] below, [[H8482]] who [[H834]] once spread [[H5414]] their terror [[H2851]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]] They bear [[H5375]] their disgrace [[H3639]] with [[H854]] those who descend [[H3381]] to the Pit. [[H953]] 
25 Among [[H8432]] the slain [[H2491]] they prepare [[H5414]] a resting place for Elam [[H4904]] with all [[H3605]] her hordes, [[H1995]] with her graves [[H6913]] all around her. [[H5439]] All [[H3605]] of them are uncircumcised, [[H6189]] slain [[H2491]] by the sword, [[H2719]] although [[H3588]] their terror [[H2851]] was once spread [[H5414]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]] They bear [[H5375]] their disgrace [[H3639]] with [[H854]] those who descend [[H3381]] to the Pit. [[H953]] They are placed [[H5414]] among [[H8432]] the slain. [[H2491]] 
26 Meshech [[H4902]] and Tubal [[H8422]] are there [[H8033]] with all [[H3605]] their multitudes, [[H1995]] with their graves [[H6913]] all around them. [[H5439]] All [[H3605]] of them are uncircumcised, [[H6189]] slain [[H2490]] by the sword, [[H2719]] because [[H3588]] they spread [[H5414]] their terror [[H2851]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]] 
27 They do not [[H3808]] lie down [[H7901]] with [[H854]] the fallen [[H5307]] warriors [[H1368]] of old, [[H6189]] who [[H834]] went down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] with their weapons [[H3627]] of war, [[H4421]] whose swords [[H2719]] were placed [[H5414]] under [[H8478]] their heads, [[H7218]] whose shields [[H5771]] rested [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] their bones, [[H6106]] although [[H3588]] the terror [[H2851]] of the mighty [[H1368]] was once in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]] 
28 But you too [[H859]] will be shattered [[H7665]] and lie down [[H7901]] among [[H8432]] the uncircumcised, [[H6189]] with [[H854]] those slain [[H2491]] by the sword. [[H2719]] 
29 Edom [[H123]] is there, [[H8033]] and all [[H3605]] her kings [[H4428]] and princes, [[H5387]] who [[H834]] despite their might [[H1369]] are laid [[H5414]] among [[H854]] those slain [[H2491]] by the sword. [[H2719]] They [[H1992]] lie down [[H7901]] with [[H854]] the uncircumcised, [[H6189]] with [[H854]] those who descend [[H3381]] to the Pit. [[H953]] 
30 All [[H3605]] the leaders [[H5257]] of the north [[H6828]] and all [[H3605]] the Sidonians [[H6722]] are there; [[H8033]] they [[H834]] went down [[H3381]] in disgrace [[H954]] with [[H854]] the slain, [[H2491]] despite the terror [[H2851]] of their might. [[H1369]] They lie [[H7901]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] with [[H854]] those slain [[H2491]] by the sword [[H2719]] and bear [[H5375]] their shame [[H3639]] with [[H854]] those who descend [[H3381]] to the Pit. [[H953]] 
31 Pharaoh [[H6547]] will see them [[H7200]] and be comforted [[H5162]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] his multitude— [[H1995]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his army, [[H2428]] slain [[H2491]] by the sword, [[H2719]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
32 For [[H3588]] I will spread [[H5414]] My terror [[H2851]] in the land [[H776]] of the living, [[H2416]] so that Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his multitude [[H1995]] will be laid to rest [[H7901]] among [[H8432]] the uncircumcised, [[H6189]] with [[H854]] those slain [[H2491]] by the sword, [[H2719]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]
