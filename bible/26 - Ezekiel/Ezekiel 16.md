# Ezekiel 16
[[Ezekiel 15|←]] • [[Ezekiel 17|→]]
1 Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] confront [[H3045]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with her [[H853]] abominations [[H8441]] 
3 and tell [her] [[H559]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] to Jerusalem: [[H3389]] ‘Your origin [[H4351]] and your birth [[H4138]] were in the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites. [[H3669]] Your father [[H1]] was an Amorite [[H567]] and your mother [[H517]] a Hittite. [[H2850]] 
4 On the day [[H3117]] of your birth [[H4138]] your cord [[H8270]] was not [[H3808]] cut, [[H3772]] nor [[H3808]] were you washed [[H7364]] with water [[H4325]] for cleansing. [[H4935]] You were not [[H3808]] rubbed with salt [[H4414]] or wrapped in cloths. [[H2853]] 
5 No [[H3808]] one cared enough [[H2347]] for you [[H5921]] to do [[H6213]] even one [[H259]] of these things [[H428]] out of compassion [[H2550]] for you. [[H5921]] Instead, you were thrown out [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the open [[H6440]] field, [[H7704]] because you [[H5315]] were despised [[H1604]] on the day [[H3117]] of your birth. [[H3205]] 
6 Then I passed [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] you and saw [[H7200]] you squirming [[H947]] in your blood, [[H1818]] and as you lay there in your blood [[H1818]] I said [[H559]] to you,  “Live!” [[H2421]] [There] [[H1818]] I said [[H559]] to you,  “Live!” [[H2421]] 
7 I made [[H5414]] you thrive [[H7233]] like a plant [[H6780]] of the field. [[H7704]] You grew up [[H7235]] and matured [[H1431]] and became [[H935]] very beautiful. [[H5716]] Your breasts [[H7699]] were formed [[H3559]] and your hair [[H8181]] grew, [[H6779]] but you [[H859]] were naked [[H5903]] and bare. [[H6181]] 
8 Then I passed [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] you and saw you, [[H7200]] and you were indeed [[H2009]] old enough [[H6256]] for love. [[H1730]] So I spread [[H6566]] My cloak [[H3671]] over you [[H5921]] and covered [[H3680]] your nakedness. [[H6172]] I pledged Myself to you, [[H7650]] entered [[H935]] into a covenant [[H1285]] with you, [[H854]] and you became [[H1961]] Mine,  declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
9 Then I bathed [[H7364]] you with water, [[H4325]] rinsed off [[H7857]] your blood, [[H1818]] and anointed [[H5480]] you with oil. [[H8081]] 
10 I clothed [[H3847]] you in embroidered cloth [[H7553]] and provided you [[H5274]] sandals of fine leather. [[H8476]] I wrapped [[H2280]] you in fine linen [[H8336]] and covered [[H3680]] you with silk. [[H4897]] 
11 I adorned [[H5710]] you with jewelry, [[H5716]] and I put [[H5414]] bracelets [[H6781]] on [[H5921]] your wrists [[H3027]] and a chain [[H7242]] around [[H5921]] your neck. [[H1627]] 
12 I put [[H5414]] a ring [[H5141]] in [[H5921]] your nose, [[H639]] earrings [[H5694]] on [[H5921]] your ears, [[H241]] and a beautiful [[H8597]] crown [[H5850]] upon your head. [[H7218]] 
13 So you were adorned [[H5710]] with gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] and your clothes [[H4403]] were of fine linen, [[H8336]] silk, [[H4897]] and embroidered cloth. [[H7553]] You ate [[H398]] fine flour, [[H5560]] honey, [[H1706]] and oil. [[H8081]] You became very [[H3966]] beautiful [[H3302]] and rose to be [[H6743]] a queen. [[H4410]] 
14 Your fame [[H8034]] spread [[H3318]] among the nations [[H1471]] on account of your beauty, [[H3308]] for [[H3588]] it [was] [[H1931]] perfect [[H3632]] in the splendor [[H1926]] I bestowed [[H7760]] on you, [[H5921]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3068]] 
15 But because of [[H5921]] your fame, [[H8034]] you trusted [[H982]] in your beauty [[H3308]] and played the harlot. [[H2181]] You lavished [[H8210]] your favors [[H8457]] on [[H5921]] everyone [[H3605]] who passed by, [[H5674]] and your beauty was theirs for the asking. [[H1961]] 
16 You took [[H3947]] some of your garments [[H899]] and made [[H6213]] colorful [[H2921]] high places for yourself, [[H1116]] and on them [[H5921]] you prostituted yourself. [[H2181]] Such things should not [[H3808]] have happened; [[H935]] never should [[H3808]] they have occurred! [[H1961]] 
17 You also took [[H3947]] the fine [[H8597]] jewelry [[H3627]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] I had given you, [[H5414]] and you made [[H6213]] male [[H2145]] idols [[H6754]] with which  to prostitute yourself. [[H2181]] 
18 You took [[H3947]] your embroidered [[H7553]] garments [[H899]] to cover them, [[H3680]] and you set [[H5414]] My oil [[H8081]] and incense [[H7004]] before them. [[H6440]] 
19 And you set [[H5414]] before them [[H6440]] as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] the food [[H3899]] I had given you— [[H5414]] the fine flour, [[H5560]] oil, [[H8081]] and honey [[H1706]] that I had fed you. [[H398]] That is what happened, [[H1961]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
20 You even took [[H3947]] the sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] you bore [[H3205]] to Me  and sacrificed [[H2076]] them  as food to idols. [[H398]] Was your prostitution [[H8457]] not enough? [[H4592]] 
21 You slaughtered [[H7819]] My children [[H1121]] and delivered them up [[H5414]] through the fire to idols. [[H5674]] 
22 And [[H853]] in all [[H3605]] your abominations [[H8441]] and acts of prostitution, [[H8457]] you did not [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of your youth [[H5271]] when you were [[H1961]] naked [[H5903]] and bare, [[H6181]] wallowing [[H947]] in your own blood. [[H1818]] 
23 Woe! [[H188]] Woe to you, [[H188]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] And [[H1961]] after [[H310]] all [[H3605]] your other wickedness, [[H7451]] 
24 you built [[H1129]] yourself  a mound [[H1354]] and made [[H6213]] yourself  a lofty shrine [[H7413]] in every [[H3605]] public square. [[H7339]] 
25 At [[H413]] the head [[H7218]] of every [[H3605]] street [[H1870]] you built [[H1129]] your lofty shrines [[H7413]] and degraded [[H8581]] your beauty. [[H3308]] With increasing [[H7235]] promiscuity, [[H8457]] you spread [[H6589]] your legs [[H7272]] to all [[H3605]] who passed by. [[H5674]] 
26 You prostituted yourself [[H2181]] with [[H413]] your lustful [[H1432]] neighbors, [[H7934]] the Egyptians, [[H4714]] and increased [[H7235]] your promiscuity [[H8457]] to provoke Me to anger. [[H3707]] 
27 Therefore [[H2009]] I stretched out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against you [[H5921]] and reduced [[H1639]] your portion. [[H2706]] I gave you over [[H5414]] to the desire [[H5315]] of those who hate you, [[H8130]] the daughters [[H1323]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] who were ashamed [[H3637]] of your lewd [[H2154]] conduct. [[H1870]] 
28 Then you prostituted yourself [[H2181]] with [[H413]] the Assyrians [[H804]] because you were not [[H1115]] satisfied. [[H7654]] Even after [that], [[H2181]] you were still [[H1571]] not [[H3808]] satisfied. [[H7646]] 
29 So you extended [[H7235]] your promiscuity [[H8457]] to [[H413]] Chaldea, [[H3778]] the land [[H776]] of merchants— [[H3667]] but even [[H1571]] with this [[H2063]] you were not [[H3808]] satisfied! [[H7646]] 
30 How [[H4100]] weak-willed [[H535]] is your heart, [[H3826]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] while you do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these things, [[H428]] the acts [[H4639]] of a shameless [[H7986]] prostitute! [[H2181]] 
31 But when you built [[H1129]] your shrines [[H1354]] at the head [[H7218]] of every [[H3605]] street [[H1870]] and made [[H6213]] your lofty shrines [[H7413]] in every [[H3605]] public square, [[H7339]] you were [[H1961]] not even like [[H3808]] a prostitute, [[H2181]] because you scorned [[H7046]] payment. [[H868]] 
32 You adulterous wife! [[H5003]] You receive [[H3947]] strangers [[H2114]] instead of [[H8478]] your own husband! [[H376]] 
33 Men give [[H5414]] gifts [[H5078]] to all [[H3605]] [their] prostitutes, [[H2181]] but you [[H859]] gave [[H5414]] gifts [[H5083]] to all [[H3605]] your lovers. [[H157]] You bribed [[H7809]] them [[H853]] to come [[H935]] to you [[H413]] from everywhere [[H5439]] for your illicit favors. [[H8457]] 
34 So your prostitution [[H8457]] is [[H1961]] the opposite [[H2016]] of that [[H4480]] of other women: [[H802]] No one [[H3808]] solicited [[H310]] your favors, [[H2181]] and you paid [[H5414]] a fee [[H868]] instead of [[H3808]] receiving [[H5414]] one; [[H868]] so you  are [[H1961]] the very opposite.’ [[H2016]] 
35 Therefore, [[H3651]] O prostitute, [[H2181]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD! [[H3068]] 
36 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you poured out [[H8210]] your wealth [[H5178]] and exposed [[H1540]] your nakedness [[H6172]] in your promiscuity [[H8457]] with [[H5921]] your lovers [[H157]] and with [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] your detestable [[H8441]] idols, [[H1544]] and because of the blood [[H1818]] of your children [[H1121]] which [[H834]] you gave [[H5414]] to them,  
37 therefore [[H3651]] I will surely [[H2005]] gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the lovers [[H157]] with whom you found pleasure, [[H6149]] all [[H3605]] those [[H834]] you loved [[H157]] and [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] those [[H834]] you hated. [[H8130]] I will gather [[H6908]] them [[H853]] against you [[H5921]] from all around [[H5439]] and expose [[H1540]] [you] [[H6172]] before them, [[H413]] and they will see [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] your nakedness. [[H6172]] 
38 And I will sentence you [[H8199]] to the punishment [[H4941]] of women who commit adultery [[H5003]] and those who shed [[H8210]] blood; [[H1818]] so I will bring upon you [[H5414]] the wrath [[H2534]] of your bloodshed [[H1818]] and jealousy. [[H7068]] 
39 Then I will hand you over [[H5414]] to [your lovers], [[H3027]] and they will level [[H2040]] your mounds [[H1354]] and tear down [[H5422]] your lofty shrines. [[H7413]] They will strip off [[H6584]] your clothes, [[H899]] take [[H3947]] your fine [[H8597]] jewelry, [[H3627]] and leave you [[H3240]] naked [[H5903]] and bare. [[H6181]] 
40 They will bring [[H5927]] a mob [[H6951]] against [[H5921]] you to stone [[H7275]] you [[H853]] and cut you to pieces [[H1333]] with their swords. [[H2719]] 
41 Then they will burn down [[H8313]] your houses [[H1004]] and execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H8201]] against you  in the sight [[H5869]] of many [[H7227]] women. [[H802]] I will put an end [[H7673]] to your prostitution, [[H2181]] and you will never [[H3808]] again [[H1571]] pay [[H5414]] your lovers. [[H868]] 
42 So I will lay to rest [[H5117]] My wrath [[H2534]] against you,  and My jealousy [[H7068]] will turn away [[H5493]] from you. [[H4480]] Then I will be calm [[H8252]] and no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] angry. [[H3707]] 
43 Because [[H3282]] you did not [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of your youth, [[H5271]] but enraged [[H7264]] Me with all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things, [[H589]] I will surely [[H1571]] bring your deeds [[H1870]] down [[H5414]] upon your own head, [[H7218]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] Have you not [[H3808]] committed [[H6213]] this lewdness [[H2154]] on top [[H5921]] of all [[H3605]] your [other] abominations? [[H8441]] 
44 Behold, [[H2009]] everyone [[H3605]] who quotes proverbs [[H4911]] will recite this proverb [[H4911]] about you: [[H5921]] “Like mother, [[H517]] like daughter.” [[H1323]] 
45 You [[H859]] are the daughter [[H1323]] of your mother, [[H517]] who despised [[H1602]] her husband [[H376]] and children. [[H1121]] You [[H859]] are the sister [[H269]] of your sisters, [[H269]] who [[H834]] despised [[H1602]] their husbands [[H582]] and children. [[H1121]] Your mother [[H517]] was a Hittite [[H2850]] and your father [[H1]] an Amorite. [[H567]] 
46 Your older [[H1419]] sister [[H269]] was Samaria, [[H8111]] who [[H1931]] lived [[H3427]] with her daughters [[H1323]] to [[H5921]] your north; [[H8040]] and your younger [[H6996]] sister [[H269]] was Sodom, [[H5467]] who lived [[H3427]] with her daughters [[H1323]] to [[H4480]] your south. [[H3225]] 
47 You not only [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in their [[H2004]] ways [[H1870]] and practiced [[H6213]] their abominations, [[H8441]] but soon you were [[H4592]] more depraved than they were. [[H7843]] 
48 As surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] your sister [[H269]] Sodom [[H5467]] and her daughters [[H1323]] never [[H518]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] you [[H859]] and your daughters [[H1323]] have done. [[H6213]] 
49 Now [[H2009]] this [[H2088]] was [[H1961]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of your sister [[H269]] Sodom: [[H5467]] She and her daughters [[H1323]] were [[H1961]] arrogant, [[H1347]] overfed, [[H7653]] and complacent; [[H8252]] they did not [[H3808]] help [[H2388]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy. [[H34]] 
50 Thus they were haughty [[H1361]] and committed [[H6213]] abominations [[H8441]] before Me, [[H6440]] and when [[H834]] I saw this, [[H7200]] I removed [[H5493]] them. [[H853]] 
51 But Samaria [[H8111]] did not [[H3808]] commit [[H2398]] half [[H2677]] the sins you did. [[H2403]] You have multiplied [[H7235]] your abominations [[H8441]] beyond theirs, [[H2007]] and all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] you have committed [[H6213]] have made your sisters [[H269]] appear righteous. [[H6663]] 
52 So now [[H1571]] you [[H859]] must bear [[H5375]] your disgrace, [[H3639]] since [[H834]] you have brought justification [[H6419]] for your sisters. [[H269]] For they appear more righteous [[H6663]] than you, [[H4480]] because your sins [[H2403]] were more vile [[H8581]] than theirs. [[H2004]] So you [[H859]] too [[H1571]] must bear [[H5375]] your shame [[H954]] and disgrace, [[H3639]] since you have made your sisters [[H269]] appear righteous. [[H6663]] 
53 But I will restore [[H7725]] Sodom [[H5467]] and her daughters [[H1323]] from captivity, [[H7622]] as well as [[H7622]] Samaria [[H8111]] and her daughters. [[H1323]] And I will restore you [[H7622]] along with them. [[H8432]] 
54 So [[H4616]] you will bear [[H5375]] your disgrace [[H3639]] and be ashamed [[H3637]] of all [[H3605]] you did [[H6213]] to comfort them. [[H5162]] 
55 And your sisters, [[H269]] Sodom [[H5467]] with her daughters [[H1323]] and Samaria [[H8111]] with her daughters, [[H1323]] will return [[H7725]] to their former state. [[H6927]] You [[H859]] and your daughters [[H1323]] will also return [[H7725]] to your former state. [[H6927]] 
56 Did you not [[H3808]] treat [[H1961]] your sister [[H269]] Sodom [[H5467]] as an object of scorn [[H8052]] in the day [[H3117]] of your pride, [[H1347]] 
57 before [[H2962]] your wickedness [[H7451]] was uncovered? [[H1540]] Even so, [[H3644]] you are now [[H6256]] scorned [[H2781]] by the daughters [[H1323]] of Edom [[H758]] and all [[H3605]] those around her, [[H5439]] and by the daughters [[H1323]] of the Philistines— [[H6430]] all those around you [[H5439]] who despise [[H7590]] you. [[H853]] 
58 You [[H859]] will bear the consequence [[H5375]] of your lewdness [[H2154]] and [[H853]] your abominations, [[H8441]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD.’ [[H3068]] 
59 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will deal [[H6213]] with you [[H854]] according to [[H834]] your deeds, [[H6213]] since [[H834]] you have despised [[H959]] the oath [[H423]] by breaking [[H6565]] the covenant. [[H1285]] 
60 But I [[H589]] will remember [[H2142]] the covenant [[H1285]] I made with you [[H854]] in the days [[H3117]] of your youth, [[H5271]] and I will establish [[H6965]] an everlasting covenant with you. [[H5769]] 
61 Then you will remember [[H2142]] your ways [[H1870]] and be ashamed [[H3637]] when you receive [[H3947]] your older [[H1419]] and [[H413]] younger [[H6996]] sisters. [[H269]] I will give [[H5414]] them [[H853]] to you  as daughters, [[H1323]] but not [[H3808]] because of [[H4480]] My covenant with you. [[H1285]] 
62 So I [[H589]] will establish [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] with you, [[H854]] and you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] 
63 so that [[H4616]] when I make atonement [[H3722]] for all [[H3605]] you have done, [[H6213]] you will remember [[H2142]] and be ashamed, [[H954]] and never [[H3808]] open [[H6610]] your mouth [[H6310]] again [[H5750]] because of [[H6440]] your disgrace, [[H3639]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]
