1 Then the Spirit [[H7307]] lifted me up [[H5375]] and brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that faces [[H6437]] east. [[H6921]] And there [[H2009]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] [were] twenty-five [[H6242]] men. [[H376]] Among [[H8432]] them I saw [[H7200]] Jaazaniah [[H2970]] son [[H1121]] of Azzur [[H5809]] and Pelatiah [[H6410]] son [[H1121]] of Benaiah, [[H1141]] who were leaders [[H8269]] of the people. [[H5971]] 
2 And [the LORD] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] these [[H428]] are the men [[H376]] who plot [[H2803]] evil [[H205]] and give [[H3289]] wicked [[H7451]] counsel [[H6098]] in this [[H2063]] city. [[H5892]] 
3 They are saying, [[H559]] ‘Is not [[H3808]] the time near [[H7138]] to build [[H1129]] houses? [[H1004]] The city [[H1931]] is a cooking pot, [[H5518]] and we [[H587]] are the meat.’ [[H1320]] 
4 Therefore [[H3651]] prophesy [[H5012]] against them; [[H5921]] prophesy, [[H5012]] O son [[H1121]] of man!” [[H120]] 
5 And the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] fell [[H5307]] upon me [[H5921]] and told [[H559]] me [[H413]] to declare [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “That is what [[H3651]] you are thinking, [[H559]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] the thoughts [[H4609]] that arise in your minds. [[H7307]] 
6 You have multiplied [[H7235]] those you killed [[H2491]] in this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] and filled [[H4390]] its streets [[H2351]] with the dead. [[H2491]] 
7 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] The slain [[H2491]] you have laid [[H7760]] within [[H8432]] [this city] [[H1992]] are the meat, [[H1320]] and the city [[H1931]] is the pot; [[H5518]] but I will remove you [[H3318]] from it. [[H8432]] 
8 You fear [[H3372]] the sword, [[H2719]] so I will bring [[H935]] the sword [[H2719]] against you, [[H5921]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
9 I will bring you [[H3318]] out of [the city] [[H8432]] and hand you over to [[H5414]] foreigners; [[H2114]] I will execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] against you.  
10 You will fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and I will judge [[H8199]] you [[H5921]] to the border [[H1366]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 The city [[H1931]] will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] a pot for you, [[H5518]] nor will you [[H859]] be [[H1961]] the meat [[H1320]] within it. [[H8432]] I will judge [[H8199]] you [[H853]] even to [[H413]] the borders [[H1366]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
12 Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] For [[H834]] you have neither [[H3808]] followed [[H1980]] My statutes [[H2706]] nor [[H3808]] practiced [[H6213]] my ordinances, [[H4941]] but you have conformed [[H6213]] to the ordinances [[H4941]] of the nations [[H1471]] around you.” [[H5439]] 
13 Now as I was [[H1961]] prophesying, [[H5012]] Pelatiah [[H6410]] son [[H1121]] of Benaiah [[H1141]] died. [[H4191]] Then I fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H5921]] and cried out [[H2199]] in a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] “Oh, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] will You [[H859]] bring [[H6213]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel [[H3478]] to a complete end?” [[H3617]] 
14 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
15 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] your brothers— [[H251]] your relatives, [[H251]] your fellow exiles, [[H582]] and the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel— [[H3478]] are those of whom [[H834]] the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] have said, [[H559]] ‘They are far [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] the LORD; [[H3068]] this land [[H776]] has been given us [[H5414]] as a possession.’ [[H4181]] 
16 Therefore [[H3651]] declare [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Although [[H3588]] I sent them far away [[H7368]] among the nations [[H1471]] and scattered [[H6327]] them among the countries, [[H776]] yet for a little while [[H4592]] I have been [[H1961]] a sanctuary [[H4720]] for them  in the countries [[H776]] to which [[H834]] they have gone.’ [[H935]] 
17 Therefore [[H3651]] declare [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will gather [[H6908]] you from [[H4480]] the peoples [[H5971]] and assemble [[H622]] you from [[H4480]] the countries [[H776]] to which [[H834]] you have been scattered, [[H6327]] and I will give [[H5414]] you [back] [[H853]] the land [[H127]] of Israel.’ [[H3478]] 
18 ‘When they return [[H935]] to it, [[H8033]] they will remove [[H5493]] from it [[H4480]] all [[H3605]] its detestable things [[H8251]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] its abominations. [[H8441]] 
19 And I will give [[H5414]] them  singleness [[H259]] of heart [[H3820]] and put [[H5414]] a new [[H2319]] spirit [[H7307]] within them; [[H7130]] I will remove [[H5493]] their heart [[H3820]] of stone [[H68]] and give [[H5414]] them a heart [[H3820]] of flesh, [[H1320]] 
20 so that [[H4616]] they may follow [[H1980]] My statutes, [[H2708]] keep [[H8104]] My ordinances, [[H4941]] and practice them. [[H6213]] Then they will be [[H1961]] My people, [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]] 
21 But as for [[H413]] those whose hearts [[H3820]] pursue [[H1980]] detestable things [[H8251]] and abominations, [[H8441]] I will bring their conduct [[H1870]] down [[H5414]] upon their own heads, [[H7218]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3068]] 
22 Then the cherubim, [[H3742]] with the wheels [[H212]] beside them, [[H5980]] spread [[H5375]] their wings, [[H3671]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] was above [[H5921]] them. [[H4605]] 
23 And the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] rose up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] within [[H8432]] the city [[H5892]] and stood [[H5975]] over [[H5921]] the mountain [[H2022]] east [[H6924]] of the city. [[H5892]] 
24 The Spirit [[H7307]] lifted me up [[H5375]] and carried me [[H935]] back [[H413]] to Chaldea, [[H3778]] to the exiles [[H1473]] in the vision [given] [[H4758]] by the Spirit [[H7307]] of God. [[H430]] After the vision [[H4758]] I had seen [[H7200]] had gone up [[H5927]] from me, [[H5921]] 
25 I told [[H1696]] the exiles [[H1473]] everything [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] had shown me. [[H7200]]
