# Ezekiel 31
[[Ezekiel 30|←]] • [[Ezekiel 32|→]]
1 In the eleventh [[H259]] year, [[H8141]] in the third month, [[H7992]] on the first [[H259]] day, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] say [[H559]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and to [[H413]] his multitude: [[H1995]] ‘Who [[H4310]] can be compared [[H1819]] to your greatness? [[H1433]] 
3 Look at [[H2009]] Assyria, [[H804]] a cedar [[H730]] in Lebanon, [[H3844]] with beautiful [[H3303]] branches [[H6057]] that shaded [[H6751]] the forest. [[H2793]] It towered [[H1362]] on high; [[H6967]] its top [[H6788]] was [[H1961]] among [[H996]] the clouds. [[H5688]] 
4 The waters [[H4325]] made it grow; [[H1431]] the deep springs [[H8415]] made it tall, [[H7311]] directing [[H1980]] their streams [[H5104]] all around [[H5439]] its base [[H4302]] and sending [[H7971]] their channels [[H8585]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field. [[H7704]] 
5 Therefore [[H5921]] it towered [[H1361]] higher [[H6967]] than all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field. [[H7704]] Its branches [[H5634]] multiplied, [[H7235]] and its boughs [[H6288]] grew long [[H748]] as it spread them out [[H7971]] because of the abundant [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]] 
6 All [[H3605]] the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] nested [[H7077]] in its branches, [[H5589]] and all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] gave birth [[H3205]] beneath [[H8478]] its boughs; [[H6288]] all [[H3605]] the great [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] lived [[H3427]] in its shade. [[H6738]] 
7 It was beautiful [[H3302]] in its greatness, [[H1433]] in the length [[H753]] of its limbs, [[H1808]] for [[H3588]] its roots [[H8328]] extended [[H1961]] to [[H413]] abundant [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]] 
8 The cedars [[H730]] in the garden [[H1588]] of God [[H430]] could not [[H3808]] rival it; [[H6004]] the pine trees [[H1265]] could not [[H3808]] compare [[H1819]] with [[H413]] its branches, [[H5589]] nor [[H3808]] the plane trees [[H6196]] match [[H1961]] its boughs. [[H6288]] No [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] in the garden [[H1588]] of God [[H430]] could compare [[H1819]] with [[H413]] its beauty. [[H3308]] 
9 I made [[H6213]] it beautiful [[H3303]] with its many [[H7230]] branches, [[H1808]] the envy [[H7065]] of all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of Eden, [[H5731]] which [[H834]] were in the garden [[H1588]] of God.’ [[H430]] 
10 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Since [[H3282]] it became great [[H1361]] in height [[H6967]] and set [[H5414]] its top [[H6788]] among [[H996]] the clouds, [[H5688]] and it grew proud [[H7311]] on account of its height, [[H1363]] 
11 I handed it over [[H5414]] to the ruler [[H410]] of the nations, [[H1471]] for [[H6213]] him to deal [[H6213]] with it  according to its wickedness. [[H7562]] I have banished it. [[H1644]] 
12 Foreigners, [[H2114]] the most ruthless [[H6184]] of the nations, [[H1471]] cut it down [[H3772]] and left it. [[H5203]] Its branches [[H1808]] have fallen [[H5307]] on [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] and in every [[H3605]] valley; [[H1516]] its boughs [[H6288]] lay broken [[H7665]] in all [[H3605]] the earth’s [[H776]] ravines. [[H650]] And all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] left [[H3381]] its shade [[H6738]] and abandoned it. [[H5203]] 
13 All [[H3605]] the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] nested [[H7931]] on [[H5921]] its fallen trunk, [[H4658]] and all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] were [[H1961]] among [[H413]] its boughs. [[H6288]] 
14 This happened so that [[H4616]] no other [[H3808]] trees [[H6086]] by the waters [[H4325]] would become great [[H1361]] in height [[H6967]] and set [[H5414]] their tops [[H6788]] among [[H996]] the clouds, [[H5688]] and [[H3808]] no other [[H3808]] well-watered [[H8354]] trees [[H352]] would reach [[H5975]] them in height. [[H1363]] For [[H3588]] they have all [[H3605]] been consigned [[H5414]] to death, [[H4194]] to [[H413]] the depths [[H8482]] of the earth, [[H776]] among [[H8432]] the mortals [[H1121]] who descend [[H3381]] to the Pit. [[H953]] 
15 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘On the day [[H3117]] it was brought down [[H3381]] to Sheol, [[H7585]] I caused grief. [[H56]] I covered [[H3680]] the deep [[H8415]] because of it; [[H5921]] I held back [[H4513]] its rivers; [[H5104]] its abundant [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] were restrained. [[H3607]] I made Lebanon [[H3844]] mourn [[H6937]] for it, [[H5921]] and all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] fainted [[H5969]] because of it. [[H5921]] 
16 I made the nations [[H1471]] quake [[H7493]] at the sound [[H6963]] of its downfall, [[H4658]] when I cast it down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] with [[H854]] those who descend [[H3381]] to the Pit. [[H953]] Then all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of Eden, [[H5731]] the choicest [[H4005]] and best [[H2896]] of Lebanon, [[H3844]] all [[H3605]] the well-watered trees, [[H8354]] were consoled [[H5162]] in the earth [[H776]] below. [[H8482]] 
17 They [[H1992]] too [[H1571]] descended [[H3381]] with it [[H854]] to Sheol, [[H7585]] to [[H413]] those slain [[H2491]] by the sword. [[H2719]] As its allies [[H2220]] they had lived [[H3427]] in its shade [[H6738]] among [[H8432]] the nations. [[H1471]] 
18 Who [[H4310]] then [[H3602]] is like you [[H1819]] in glory [[H3519]] and greatness [[H1433]] among the trees [[H6086]] of Eden? [[H5731]] You also will be brought down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the depths [[H8482]] of the earth [[H776]] to be with [[H854]] the trees [[H6086]] of Eden. [[H5731]] You will lie [[H7901]] among [[H8432]] the uncircumcised, [[H6189]] with [[H854]] those slain [[H2491]] by the sword. [[H2719]] This [[H1931]] is Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his multitude, [[H1995]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]]
