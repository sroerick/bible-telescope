# Ezekiel 20
[[Ezekiel 19|←]] • [[Ezekiel 21|→]]
1 In the seventh [[H7637]] year, [[H8141]] on the tenth [[H6218]] day [[H2320]] of the fifth month, [[H2549]] some of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to inquire [[H1875]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and they sat down [[H3427]] before me. [[H6440]] 
2 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
3 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] speak [[H1696]] to the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] and tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Have you [[H859]] come [[H935]] to inquire [[H1875]] of Me? [[H853]] As surely as [[H589]] I live, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] be consulted [[H1875]] by you,  declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3068]] 
4 Will you judge [[H8199]] them, [[H853]] will you judge [them], [[H8199]] son [[H1121]] of man? [[H120]] Confront them with [[H3045]] the abominations [[H8441]] of their fathers [[H1]] 
5 and tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘On the day [[H3117]] I chose [[H977]] Israel, [[H3478]] I swore an oath [[H5375]] to the descendants [[H2233]] of the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and made Myself known [[H3045]] to them  in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] With an uplifted [[H5375]] hand [[H3027]] I said [[H559]] to them,  I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
6 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I swore [[H5375]] to them  to bring them out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] into [[H413]] a land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I had searched out [[H8446]] for them,  a land flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] the glory [[H6643]] of all [[H3605]] lands. [[H776]] 
7 And I said [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] “Each of you [[H376]] must throw away [[H7993]] the abominations [[H8251]] before his eyes, [[H5869]] and you must not [[H408]] defile yourselves [[H2930]] with the idols [[H1544]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]] 
8 But they rebelled [[H4784]] against Me  and refused [[H3808]] to listen. [[H8085]] None of them [[H376]] cast away [[H7993]] the abominations [[H8251]] before their eyes, [[H5869]] and they did not [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] the idols [[H1544]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] So I resolved [[H559]] to pour out [[H8210]] My wrath [[H2534]] upon them [[H5921]] and vent [[H3615]] My anger [[H639]] against them  in [[H8432]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
9 But I acted [[H6213]] for the sake [[H4616]] of My name, [[H8034]] that it should not [[H1115]] be profaned [[H2490]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the nations [[H1471]] among whom they were living, [[H1992]] in whose [[H834]] sight [[H5869]] I had revealed Myself [[H3045]] to [Israel] [[H413]] by bringing them out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
10 So I brought them out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and led [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
11 And I gave [[H5414]] them  My statutes [[H2708]] and made known [[H3045]] to them [[H853]] My ordinances— [[H4941]] for the man [[H120]] who [[H834]] does [these things] [[H6213]] will live [[H2425]] by them.  
12 I also [[H1571]] gave [[H5414]] them  My Sabbaths [[H7676]] as a sign [[H226]] between us, [[H996]] so that they would know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] who sanctifies them. [[H6942]] 
13 Yet the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] rebelled [[H4784]] against Me  in the wilderness. [[H4057]] They did not [[H3808]] follow [[H1980]] My statutes [[H2708]] and they rejected [[H3988]] My ordinances— [[H4941]] though the man [[H120]] who [[H834]] does [these things] [[H6213]] will live [[H2425]] by them—  and they [[H853]] utterly [[H3966]] profaned [[H2490]] My Sabbaths. [[H7676]] Then I resolved [[H559]] to pour [[H8210]] out My wrath [[H2534]] upon them [[H5921]] and put an end to them [[H3615]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
14 But I acted [[H6213]] for the sake [[H4616]] of My name, [[H8034]] so that it would not [[H1115]] be profaned [[H2490]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the nations [[H1471]] in whose [[H834]] sight [[H5869]] I had brought them out. [[H3318]] 
15 Moreover, [[H1571]] with an uplifted hand [[H3027]] I [[H589]] swore [[H5375]] to them  in the wilderness [[H4057]] that I would not [[H1115]] bring [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] I had given [them]— [[H5414]] [a land] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] the glory [[H6643]] of all [[H3605]] lands— [[H776]] 
16 because [[H3282]] they kept rejecting [[H3988]] My ordinances, [[H4941]] profaning [[H2490]] My Sabbaths, [[H7676]] and refusing [[H3808]] to walk [[H1980]] in My statutes. [[H2708]] For [[H3588]] their hearts [[H3820]] continually went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] their idols. [[H1544]] 
17 Yet I looked on them with pity [[H2347]] and did not destroy them [[H7843]] or [[H3808]] bring [[H6213]] them [[H853]] to an end [[H3617]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
18 In the wilderness [[H4057]] I said [[H559]] to [[H413]] their children: [[H1121]] “Do not [[H408]] walk [[H1980]] in the statutes [[H2706]] of your fathers [[H1]] or keep [[H8104]] their ordinances [[H4941]] or defile [[H2930]] yourselves with their idols. [[H1544]] 
19 I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] walk [[H1980]] in My statutes, [[H2708]] keep [[H8104]] My ordinances, [[H4941]] and practice them. [[H6213]] 
20 Keep My Sabbaths [[H7676]] holy, [[H6942]] and they will be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] between us, [[H996]] so that you may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]] 
21 But the children [[H1121]] rebelled [[H4784]] against Me.  They did not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in My statutes [[H2708]] or carefully [[H8104]] observe [[H6213]] My ordinances— [[H4941]] though the man [[H120]] who [[H834]] does [these things] [[H6213]] will live [[H2425]] by them—  and they profaned [[H2490]] My Sabbaths. [[H7676]] So I resolved [[H559]] to pour [[H8210]] out My wrath [[H2534]] upon them [[H5921]] and vent [[H3615]] My anger [[H639]] against them  in the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
22 But I withheld [[H7725]] My hand [[H3027]] and acted [[H6213]] for the sake [[H4616]] of My name, [[H8034]] so that it would not [[H1115]] be profaned [[H2490]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the nations [[H1471]] in whose [[H834]] sight [[H5869]] I had brought them out. [[H3318]] 
23 However, [[H1571]] with an uplifted hand I swore [[H5375]] to them  in the wilderness [[H4057]] that I would scatter [[H6327]] them [[H853]] among the nations [[H1471]] and disperse [[H2219]] them [[H853]] throughout the lands. [[H776]] 
24 For [[H3282]] they did not [[H3808]] practice [[H6213]] My ordinances, [[H4941]] but they rejected [[H3988]] My statutes [[H2708]] and profaned [[H2490]] My Sabbaths, [[H7676]] fixing [[H1961]] their eyes [[H5869]] on the idols [[H1544]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
25 I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] gave [[H5414]] them over  to statutes [[H2706]] that were not [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] and ordinances [[H4941]] by which  they could not [[H3808]] live. [[H2421]] 
26 And I pronounced them unclean [[H2930]] through their gifts— [[H4979]] the sacrifice [[H5674]] of every [[H3605]] firstborn {in the fire}— [[H6363]] so that [[H4616]] I might devastate them, [[H8074]] in order that [[H834]] they would know [[H3045]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]] 
27 Therefore, [[H3651]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and tell them that [[H559]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘In this way [[H2063]] also [[H5750]] your fathers [[H1]] blasphemed [[H1442]] Me [[H853]] by their unfaithfulness [[H4603]] against Me. [[H4604]] 
28 When I brought [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I swore [[H5375]] to give [[H5414]] them  and they saw [[H7200]] any [[H3605]] high [[H7311]] hill [[H1389]] or leafy [[H5687]] tree, [[H6086]] there [[H8033]] they offered [[H2076]] their sacrifices, [[H2077]] presented [[H5414]] offerings [[H7133]] that provoked Me, [[H3708]] sent up [[H7760]] their fragrant [[H5207]] incense, [[H7381]] and poured out [[H5258]] their drink offerings. [[H5262]] 
29 So I asked them: [[H559]] What [[H4100]] is this high place [[H1116]] to which [[H834]] you [[H859]] go?’ [[H935]] (And to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] it is called [[H7121]] Bamah.) [[H1117]] 
30 Therefore [[H3651]] tell [[H559]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Will you [[H859]] defile yourselves [[H2930]] the way [[H1870]] your fathers did, [[H1]] prostituting [[H2181]] yourselves [[H859]] with [[H310]] their abominations? [[H8251]] 
31 When you offer [[H5375]] your gifts, [[H4979]] sacrificing your sons [[H1121]] in the fire, [[H784]] you [[H859]] continue to defile [[H2930]] yourselves with all [[H3605]] your idols [[H1544]] to [[H5704]] this day. [[H3117]] So should I [[H589]] be consulted by you, [[H1875]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel? [[H3478]] As surely as [[H589]] I live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] I will not [[H518]] be consulted [[H1875]] by you!  
32 When [[H834]] you [[H859]] say: [[H559]] “Let us be [[H1961]] like the nations, [[H1471]] like the peoples [[H4940]] of the lands, [[H776]] serving [[H8334]] wood [[H6086]] and stone,” [[H68]] what you have in [[H5921]] mind [[H7307]] will never [[H3808]] happen. [[H1961]] 
33 As surely as [[H589]] I live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] with a strong [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] an outstretched [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] and outpoured [[H8210]] wrath [[H2534]] I will rule [[H4427]] over you. [[H5921]] 
34 With a strong [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] an outstretched [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] and outpoured [[H8210]] wrath [[H2534]] I will bring [[H3318]] you from [[H4480]] the peoples [[H5971]] and gather [[H6908]] you from [[H4480]] the lands [[H776]] to which [[H834]] you were scattered. [[H6327]] 
35 And I will bring [[H935]] you [[H853]] into [[H413]] the wilderness [[H4057]] of the nations, [[H5971]] [where] [[H8033]] I will enter into judgment [[H8199]] with you [[H854]] face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face. [[H6440]] 
36 Just as [[H834]] I entered into judgment [[H8199]] with [[H854]] your fathers [[H1]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] so [[H3651]] I will enter into judgment [[H8199]] with you, [[H854]] declares [[H5002]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
37 I will make you pass [[H5674]] under [[H8478]] the rod [[H7626]] and will bring [[H935]] you into the bond [[H4562]] of the covenant. [[H1285]] 
38 And I will purge you [[H1305]] of those who rebel [[H4775]] and transgress [[H6586]] against Me.  I will bring them out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] in which they dwell, [[H4033]] but they will not [[H3808]] enter [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]] 
39 And as for you, [[H859]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Go [[H1980]] and serve [[H5647]] your idols, [[H1544]] every one of you. [[H376]] But afterward, [[H310]] you will surely [[H518]] listen [[H8085]] to Me, [[H413]] and you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] defile [[H2490]] My holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] with your gifts [[H4979]] and idols. [[H1544]] 
40 For [[H3588]] on My holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] the high [[H4791]] mountain [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] there [[H8033]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] all of them, [[H3605]] will serve [[H5647]] Me in the land. [[H776]] There [[H8033]] I will accept [[H7521]] them [[H8033]] and will require [[H1875]] your offerings [[H8641]] and choice [[H7225]] gifts, [[H4864]] along with all [[H3605]] your holy sacrifices. [[H6944]] 
41 When I bring [[H3318]] you from [[H4480]] the peoples [[H5971]] and gather [[H6908]] you from [[H4480]] the lands [[H776]] to which [[H834]] you have been scattered, [[H6327]] I will accept [[H7521]] you as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma. [[H7381]] And I will show My holiness [[H6942]] through you in the sight [[H5869]] of the nations. [[H1471]] 
42 Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] when I bring [[H935]] you [[H853]] into [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the land [[H776]] I swore [[H5375]] to give [[H5414]] your fathers. [[H1]] 
43 There [[H8033]] you will remember [[H2142]] your ways [[H1870]] and all [[H3605]] the deeds [[H5949]] with which [[H834]] you have defiled yourselves, [[H2930]] and you will loathe [[H6962]] yourselves [[H6440]] for all [[H3605]] the evils [[H7451]] you have done. [[H6213]] 
44 Then you will know, [[H3045]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] when I have dealt [[H6213]] with you [[H854]] for the sake [[H4616]] of My name [[H8034]] and not according to [[H3808]] your wicked [[H7451]] ways [[H1870]] and corrupt [[H7843]] acts, [[H5949]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]] 
45 Now the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
46 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] your face [[H6440]] toward the south, [[H8486]] preach [[H5197]] against [[H413]] it, [[H1864]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H413]] the forest [[H3293]] of the Negev. [[H5045]] 
47 Say [[H559]] to the forest [[H3293]] of the Negev: [[H5045]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD! [[H3068]] This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I am about to ignite [[H3341]] in you  a fire, [[H784]] and it will devour [[H398]] all [[H3605]] your  trees, [[H6086]] both green [[H3892]] [and] [[H3605]] dry. [[H3002]] The blazing [[H7957]] flame [[H3852]] will not [[H3808]] be quenched, [[H3518]] and by it  every [[H3605]] face [[H6440]] from south [[H5045]] to north [[H6828]] will be scorched. [[H6866]] 
48 Then all [[H3605]] people [[H1320]] will see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have kindled it; [[H1197]] it will not [[H3808]] be quenched.’” [[H3518]] 
49 Then I said, [[H559]] “Ah, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] they [[H1992]] are saying [[H559]] of me,  ‘Is he [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] [just] telling [[H4911]] parables?’” [[H4912]]
