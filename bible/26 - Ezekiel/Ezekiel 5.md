# Ezekiel 5
[[Ezekiel 4|←]] • [[Ezekiel 6|→]]
1 Now you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take [[H3947]] a sharp [[H2299]] sword, [[H2719]] use [[H3947]] it as a barber’s [[H1532]] razor, [[H8593]] and shave [[H5674]] your head [[H7218]] and beard. [[H2206]] Then take [[H3947]] a set of scales [[H3976]] and divide the hair. [[H2505]] 
2 When the days [[H3117]] of the siege [[H4692]] have ended, [[H4390]] you are to burn up [[H1197]] a third [of the hair] [[H7992]] inside [[H8432]] the city; [[H5892]] you are also to take [[H3947]] a third [[H7992]] and slash [[H5221]] it with the sword [[H2719]] all around the city; [[H5439]] and you are to scatter [[H2219]] a third [[H7992]] to the wind. [[H7307]] For I will unleash [[H7324]] a sword [[H2719]] behind them. [[H310]] 
3 But you are to take [[H3947]] a few [[H4592]] strands of hair [[H4557]] and secure [[H6696]] them [[H853]] in the folds of your garment. [[H3671]] 
4 Again, [[H5750]] take [[H3947]] a few of these, [[H1992]] throw [[H7993]] them into [[H413]] the fire, [[H784]] and burn [[H8313]] them. [[H853]] From there [[H4480]] a fire [[H784]] will spread [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
5 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘This [is] [[H2063]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which I have set [[H7760]] in the center [[H8432]] of the nations, [[H1471]] with countries [[H776]] all around her. [[H5439]] 
6 But she has rebelled [[H4784]] against My ordinances [[H4941]] more wickedly [[H7564]] than [[H4480]] the nations, [[H1471]] and [[H853]] against My statutes [[H2708]] worse than [[H4480]] the countries [[H776]] around her. [[H5439]] For [[H3588]] her people have rejected [[H3988]] My ordinances [[H4941]] and have not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in  My statutes.’ [[H2708]] 
7 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘You have been more insubordinate [[H1995]] than [[H4480]] the nations [[H1471]] around you; [[H5439]] you have not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in My statutes [[H2708]] or kept [[H6213]] My ordinances; [[H4941]] nor [[H3808]] have you even conformed [[H6213]] to the ordinances [[H4941]] of the nations [[H1471]] around you.’ [[H5439]] 
8 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I Myself am [[H589]] against you, [Jerusalem], [[H5921]] and I will execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H4941]] among you [[H8432]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the nations. [[H1471]] 
9 Because of [[H3282]] all [[H3605]] your abominations, [[H8441]] I will do [[H6213]] to you what [[H834]] I have never [[H3808]] done before [[H6213]] and [[H834]] will never [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] again. [[H5750]] 
10 As a result, [[H3651]] fathers [[H1]] among you [[H8432]] will eat [[H398]] their sons, [[H1121]] and sons [[H1121]] will eat [[H398]] their fathers. [[H1]] I will execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] against you and scatter [[H2219]] all [[H3605]] your remnant [[H7611]] to every [[H3605]] wind.’ [[H7307]] 
11 Therefore [[H3651]] as surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] because [[H3282]] you have defiled [[H2930]] My sanctuary [[H4720]] with all [[H3605]] your detestable idols [[H8251]] and abominations, [[H8441]] I Myself [[H589]] will withdraw My favor; [[H1639]] I will not look upon you [[H5869]] with pity, [[H2347]] [nor] [[H1571]] will I [[H589]] spare you. [[H2550]] 
12 A third [[H7992]] of your people will die [[H4191]] by plague [[H1698]] or be consumed [[H3615]] by famine [[H7458]] within you, [[H8432]] a third [[H7992]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] outside [your walls], [[H5439]] and a third [[H7992]] I will scatter [[H2219]] to every [[H3605]] wind [[H7307]] and unleash [[H7324]] a sword [[H2719]] behind them. [[H310]] 
13 And when My anger [[H639]] is spent [[H3615]] and I have vented [[H5117]] My wrath [[H2534]] against them,  I will be appeased. [[H5162]] And when I have spent [[H3615]] My wrath [[H2534]] on them,  they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] in My zeal [[H7068]] have spoken. [[H1696]] 
14 I will make [[H5414]] you a ruin [[H2723]] and a disgrace [[H2781]] among the nations [[H1471]] around you, [[H5439]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] who pass by. [[H5674]] 
15 So you will be [[H1961]] a reproach [[H2781]] and a taunt, [[H1422]] a warning [[H4148]] and a horror [[H4923]] to the nations [[H1471]] around you, [[H5439]] when I execute [[H6213]] judgments against you [[H8201]] in anger, [[H639]] wrath, [[H2534]] and raging [[H2534]] fury. [[H8433]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken. [[H1696]] 
16 When I shower you [[H7971]] with the deadly [[H7451]] arrows [[H2671]] of famine [[H7458]] [and] [[H834]] destruction [[H4889]] that [[H834]] I will send [[H7971]] to destroy you, [[H7843]] I will intensify [[H3254]] the famine [[H7458]] against you [[H5921]] and cut off [[H7665]] your supply [[H4294]] of bread. [[H3899]] 
17 I will send [[H7971]] famine [[H7458]] and wild [[H7451]] beasts [[H2416]] against you, [[H5921]] and they will leave you childless. [[H7921]] Plague [[H1698]] and bloodshed [[H1818]] will sweep through you, [[H5674]] and I will bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] against you. [[H5921]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken.” [[H1696]]
