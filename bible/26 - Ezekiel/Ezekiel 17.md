# Ezekiel 17
[[Ezekiel 16|←]] • [[Ezekiel 18|→]]
1 Now the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] pose [[H2330]] a riddle; [[H2420]] speak a parable [[H4911]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] 
3 and tell them that [[H559]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘A great [[H1419]] eagle [[H5404]] with great [[H1419]] wings [[H3671]] and long [[H750]] pinions, [[H83]] full [[H4392]] of feathers [[H5133]] of many colors, [[H7553]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Lebanon [[H3844]] and took away [[H3947]] the top [[H6788]] of the cedar. [[H730]] 
4 He plucked off [[H6998]] its topmost [[H7218]] shoot, [[H3242]] carried it [[H935]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of merchants, [[H3667]] and planted [[H7760]] it in a city [[H5892]] of traders. [[H7402]] 
5 He took [[H3947]] some of the seed [[H2233]] of the land [[H776]] and planted [[H5414]] it in fertile [[H2233]] soil; [[H7704]] he placed [it] [[H3947]] by [[H5921]] abundant [[H7227]] waters; [[H4325]] he set it out [[H7760]] like a willow. [[H6851]] 
6 It sprouted [[H6779]] and became [[H1961]] a spreading [[H5628]] vine, [[H1612]] low [[H8217]] in height [[H6967]] with branches [[H1808]] turned [[H6437]] toward him; [[H413]] yet its roots [[H8328]] remained [[H1961]] where it stood. [[H8478]] So it became [[H1961]] a vine [[H1612]] and yielded [[H6213]] branches, [[H905]] and sent out [[H7971]] shoots. [[H6288]] 
7 But there was [[H1961]] another [[H259]] great [[H1419]] eagle [[H5404]] with great [[H1419]] wings [[H3671]] and many [[H7227]] feathers. [[H5133]] And behold, [[H2009]] this [[H2063]] vine [[H1612]] bent [[H3719]] its roots [[H8328]] toward him. [[H5921]] It stretched out [[H7971]] its branches [[H1808]] to him  from its planting [[H4302]] bed, [[H6170]] so that he might water it. [[H8248]] 
8 It [[H1931]] had been planted [[H8362]] in [[H413]] good [[H2896]] soil [[H7704]] by [[H413]] abundant [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] in order to yield [[H6213]] branches [[H6057]] and bear [[H5375]] fruit [[H6529]] and become [[H1961]] a splendid [[H155]] vine.’ [[H1612]] 
9 So you are to tell them [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Will it flourish? [[H6743]] Will it not [[H3808]] be uprooted [[H5423]] and stripped [[H7082]] of its fruit [[H6529]] so that it shrivels? [[H3001]] All [[H3605]] its foliage [[H2964]] will wither! [[H3001]] It will not take [[H3808]] a strong [[H1419]] arm [[H2220]] or many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] to pull [[H5375]] it up [[H853]] by its roots. [[H8328]] 
10 Even if transplanted, [[H8362]] will it flourish? [[H6743]] Will it not [[H3808]] completely wither [[H3001]] when the east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] strikes? [[H5060]] It will wither [[H3001]] on [[H5921]] the bed [[H6170]] where it sprouted.’” [[H6780]] 
11 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
12 “Now [[H4994]] say to [[H559]] this rebellious [[H4805]] house: [[H1004]] ‘Do you not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] these [things] [mean]?’ [[H428]] Tell [them], [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] came [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] carried off [[H3947]] its king [[H4428]] and officials, [[H8269]] and brought them back [[H935]] with him [[H413]] to Babylon. [[H894]] 
13 He took [[H3947]] a member of the royal [[H4410]] family [[H2233]] and made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with him, [[H854]] putting [[H935]] him under oath. [[H423]] Then he carried away [[H3947]] the leading men [[H352]] of the land, [[H776]] 
14 so that the kingdom [[H4467]] would be [[H1961]] brought low, [[H8217]] unable [[H1115]] to lift itself up, [[H5375]] keeping [[H8104]] his covenant [[H1285]] to survive. [[H5975]] 
15 But this [king] rebelled [[H4775]] against [Babylon]  by sending [[H7971]] his envoys [[H4397]] to Egypt [[H4714]] to ask for [[H5414]] horses [[H5483]] and a large [[H7227]] army. [[H5971]] Will he flourish? [[H6743]] Will the one who does [[H6213]] such [[H428]] things escape? [[H4422]] Can he break [[H6565]] a covenant [[H1285]] and yet escape?’ [[H4422]] 
16 ‘As surely as [[H589]] I live,’ [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] ‘surely [[H518]] he will die [[H4191]] in [[H8432]] Babylon, [[H894]] in the land [[H4725]] of the king [[H4428]] who enthroned him, [[H4427]] whose [[H834]] oath [[H423]] he despised [[H959]] and whose [[H834]] covenant [[H1285]] he broke. [[H6565]] 
17 Pharaoh [[H6547]] with [his] mighty [[H1419]] army [[H2428]] and vast [[H7227]] horde [[H6951]] will not [[H3808]] help [[H6213]] him [[H853]] in battle, [[H4421]] when ramps [[H5550]] are built [[H8210]] and siege walls [[H1785]] constructed [[H1129]] to destroy [[H3772]] many [[H7227]] lives. [[H5315]] 
18 He despised [[H959]] the oath [[H423]] by breaking [[H6565]] the covenant. [[H1285]] Seeing that [[H2009]] he gave [[H5414]] his hand in pledge [[H3027]] yet did [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these, [[H428]] he will not [[H3808]] escape!’ [[H4422]] 
19 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘As [[H589]] surely as [[H518]] I live, [[H2416]] I will bring down [[H5414]] upon his head [[H7218]] My oath [[H423]] that [[H834]] he despised [[H959]] and My covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] he broke. [[H6331]] 
20 I will spread [[H6566]] My net [[H7568]] over him [[H5921]] and catch him [[H8610]] in My snare. [[H4686]] I will bring [[H935]] him to Babylon [[H894]] and execute judgment [[H8199]] upon him [[H854]] there [[H8033]] for the treason [[H4604]] he committed [[H4603]] against Me.  
21 All [[H3605]] his fleeing [[H4015]] troops [[H102]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and those who survive [[H7604]] will be scattered [[H6566]] to every [[H3605]] wind. [[H7307]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken.’ [[H1696]] 
22 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I [[H589]] will take a shoot [[H3947]] from the lofty [[H7311]] top [[H6788]] of the cedar, [[H730]] and I will set [it] out. [[H5414]] I will pluck [[H6998]] a tender sprig [[H7390]] from its topmost [[H7218]] shoots, [[H3127]] and I [[H589]] will plant it [[H8362]] on [[H5921]] a high [[H1364]] and lofty [[H8524]] mountain. [[H2022]] 
23 I will plant it [[H8362]] on the mountain [[H2022]] heights [[H4791]] of Israel [[H3478]] so that it will bear [[H5375]] branches; [[H6057]] it will yield [[H6213]] fruit [[H6529]] and become [[H1961]] a majestic [[H117]] cedar. [[H730]] Birds [[H6833]] of every [[H3605]] kind [[H3671]] will nest [[H7931]] under it, [[H8478]] taking shelter [[H7931]] in the shade [[H6738]] of its branches. [[H1808]] 
24 Then all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] I bring [[H8213]] the tall [[H1364]] tree {down}, [[H6086]] and make the low [[H8217]] tree [[H6086]] tall. [[H1361]] I dry up [[H3001]] the green [[H3892]] tree [[H6086]] and make the withered [[H3002]] tree [[H6086]] flourish. [[H6524]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken, [[H1696]] and I will do it. [[H6213]]
