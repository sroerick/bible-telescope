# Ezekiel 15
[[Ezekiel 14|←]] • [[Ezekiel 16|→]]
1 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] how [[H4100]] does [[H1961]] the wood [[H6086]] of the vine [[H1612]] surpass [[H3605]] any [other] [[H6086]] branch [[H2156]] among the trees [[H6086]] in the forest? [[H3293]] 
3 Can wood [[H6086]] be taken [[H3947]] from it [[H4480]] to make [[H6213]] something useful? [[H4399]] Or [[H518]] can one [[H3605]] make [[H3947]] from it [[H4480]] a peg [[H3489]] on which [[H5921]] to hang [[H8518]] utensils? [[H3627]] 
4 No, [[H2009]] it is cast [[H5414]] into the fire [[H784]] for fuel. [[H402]] The fire [[H784]] devours [[H398]] both [[H8147]] ends, [[H7098]] and the middle [[H8432]] is charred. [[H2787]] Can it be useful [[H6743]] for anything? [[H4399]] 
5 Even [[H2009]] when it was [[H1961]] whole, [[H8549]] it could not [[H3808]] be made [[H6213]] useful. [[H4399]] How much less [[H637]] can it ever [[H5750]] be [[H6213]] useful [[H4399]] when [[H3588]] the fire [[H784]] has consumed [[H398]] and charred it! [[H2787]] 
6 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Like [[H834]] the wood [[H6086]] of the vine [[H1612]] among the trees [[H6086]] of the forest, [[H3293]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] to the fire [[H784]] for fuel, [[H402]] so [[H3651]] I will give up [[H5414]] the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
7 And I will set [[H5414]] My face [[H6440]] against them.  Though they may have escaped [[H3318]] the fire, [[H784]] yet another fire [[H784]] will consume them. [[H398]] And when I set [[H7760]] My face [[H6440]] against them,  you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [am] [[H589]] the LORD. [[H3069]] 
8 Thus I will make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] desolate, [[H8077]] because [[H3282]] they have acted unfaithfully, [[H4603]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]
