1 Then the man brought me [[H1980]] back to [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] that [[H834]] faces [[H6437]] east, [[H6921]] 
2 and I saw [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] coming [[H935]] from [[H1870]] the east. [[H6921]] His voice [[H6963]] was like the roar [[H6963]] of many [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] and the earth [[H776]] shone [[H215]] with His glory. [[H3519]] 
3 The vision [[H4758]] I saw [[H7200]] was like the one [[H4758]] I had seen [[H7200]] when He came [[H935]] to destroy [[H7843]] the city, [[H5892]] and like the ones [[H4758]] I had seen [[H7200]] by [[H413]] the River [[H5104]] Kebar. [[H3529]] I fell [[H5307]] facedown, [[H413]] 
4 and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] entered [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] through [[H1870]] the gate [[H8179]] facing [[H6440]] east. [[H6921]] 
5 Then the Spirit [[H7307]] lifted me up [[H5375]] and brought me [[H935]] into [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court, [[H2691]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the temple. [[H1004]] 
6 While the man [[H376]] was [[H1961]] standing [[H5975]] beside me, [[H681]] I heard [[H8085]] someone speaking [[H1696]] to me [[H413]] from inside the temple, [[H1004]] 
7 and He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] this is the place [[H4725]] of My throne [[H3678]] and the place [[H4725]] for the soles [[H3709]] of My feet, [[H7272]] where [[H834]] I will dwell [[H7931]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites [[H1121]] forever. [[H3478]] The house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] will never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] defile [[H2930]] My holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] neither they [[H1992]] nor their kings [[H4428]] by their prostitution [[H2184]] and by the funeral offerings [[H6297]] for their kings [[H4428]] at their deaths. [[H1116]] 
8 When they placed [[H5414]] their threshold [[H5592]] next to [[H853]] My threshold [[H5592]] and their doorposts [[H4201]] beside [[H681]] My doorposts, [[H4201]] with only a wall [[H7023]] between Me and them, [[H996]] they defiled [[H2930]] My holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] by the abominations [[H8441]] they committed. [[H6213]] Therefore I have consumed [[H398]] them [[H853]] in My anger. [[H639]] 
9 Now [[H6258]] let them remove [[H7368]] far from Me [[H4480]] their prostitution [[H2184]] and the funeral offerings [[H6297]] for their kings, [[H4428]] and I will dwell [[H7931]] among them [[H8432]] forever. [[H5769]] 
10 As for you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] describe [[H5046]] the temple [[H1004]] to the [people] [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] so that they may be ashamed [[H3637]] of their iniquities. [[H5771]] Let them measure [[H4058]] the plan, [[H8508]] 
11 and if [[H518]] they are ashamed [[H3637]] of all [[H3605]] they have done, [[H6213]] then make known [[H3045]] to them [[H853]] the design [[H6699]] of the temple— [[H1004]] its arrangement [[H8498]] and its exits [[H4161]] and entrances— [[H4126]] its whole [[H3605]] design [[H6699]] along with all [[H3605]] its statutes, [[H2708]] forms, [[H6699]] and laws. [[H8451]] Write it down [[H3789]] in their sight, [[H5869]] so that they may observe [[H8104]] its complete [[H3605]] design [[H6699]] and all [[H3605]] its statutes, [[H2708]] and may carry them out. [[H6213]] 
12 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of the temple: [[H1004]] All [[H3605]] its surrounding [[H5439]] territory [[H1366]] on [[H5921]] top [[H7218]] of the mountain [[H2022]] will be most holy. [[H6944]] Yes, [[H2009]] this [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of the temple. [[H1004]] 
13 These [[H428]] are the measurements [[H4060]] of the altar [[H4196]] in long cubits [[H520]] (a cubit [[H520]] and a handbreadth): [[H2948]] Its gutter [[H2436]] [shall be] a cubit deep [[H520]] and a cubit [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] with a rim [[H1366]] of one [[H259]] span [[H2239]] around [[H5439]] its edge. [[H8193]] And this [is] [[H2088]] the height [[H1354]] of the altar: [[H4196]] 
14 The space from the gutter [[H2436]] on the ground [[H776]] to [[H5704]] the lower [[H8481]] ledge [[H5835]] [shall be] two [[H8147]] cubits [high] [[H520]] and one [[H259]] cubit [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and from the smaller [[H6996]] ledge [[H5835]] to [[H5704]] the larger [[H1419]] ledge [[H5835]] [shall be] four [[H702]] cubits high [[H520]] and one cubit [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] 
15 The altar hearth [[H741]] [shall be] four [[H702]] cubits [high], [[H520]] and four [[H702]] horns [[H7161]] shall project upward [[H4605]] from the hearth. [[H741]] 
16 The altar [hearth] [shall be] [[H741]] square [[H7251]] at [[H413]] its four [[H702]] corners, [[H7253]] twelve [cubits] [[H8147]] long [[H753]] [and] twelve [cubits] [[H8147]] wide. [[H7341]] 
17 The ledge [[H5835]] [shall also be] square, [[H413]] fourteen [cubits] [[H702]] long [[H753]] and fourteen [cubits] [[H702]] wide, [[H7341]] with a rim [[H1366]] of half [[H2677]] a cubit [[H520]] and a gutter [[H2436]] of a cubit [[H520]] all around [[H5439]] it. [[H853]] The steps of the altar [[H4609]] [shall] face [[H6437]] east.” [[H6921]] 
18 Then He said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘These [[H428]] are the statutes [[H2708]] for the altar [[H4196]] on the day [[H3117]] it is constructed, [[H6213]] so that burnt offerings [[H5930]] may be sacrificed [[H5927]] on it [[H5921]] and blood [[H1818]] may be sprinkled [[H2236]] on it: [[H5921]] 
19 You are to give [[H5414]] a young [[H1121]] bull [[H6499]] from the herd [[H1241]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] to [[H413]] the Levitical [[H3881]] priests [[H3548]] who [[H834]] are of [[H1992]] the family [[H2233]] of Zadok, [[H6659]] who approach [[H7138]] Me [[H413]] to minister before Me, [[H8334]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3068]] 
20 You are to take [[H3947]] some of its blood [[H1818]] and put [it] [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] the four [[H702]] horns of the [altar], [[H7161]] on [[H413]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H6438]] of the ledge, [[H5835]] and all around [[H5439]] the rim; [[H1366]] thus you will cleanse [[H2398]] the altar and make atonement for it. [[H3722]] 
21 Then you are to take away [[H3947]] the bull [[H6499]] for the sin offering [[H2403]] and burn it [[H8313]] in the appointed part [[H4662]] of the temple area [[H1004]] outside [[H2351]] the sanctuary. [[H4720]] 
22 On the second [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] you are to present [[H7126]] an unblemished [[H8549]] male goat [[H8163]] as a sin offering, [[H2403]] and the altar [[H4196]] is to be cleansed [[H2398]] as it was [[H834]] with the bull. [[H6499]] 
23 When you have finished [[H3615]] the purification, [[H2398]] you are to present [[H7126]] a young, [[H1121]] unblemished [[H8549]] bull [[H6499]] and an unblemished [[H8549]] ram [[H352]] from [[H4480]] the flock. [[H6629]] 
24 You must present [[H7126]] them before [[H6440]] the LORD; [[H3068]] the priests [[H3548]] are to sprinkle [[H7993]] salt [[H4417]] on them [[H5921]] and sacrifice [[H5927]] them [[H853]] [as] a burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
25 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] you are to provide [[H6213]] a male goat [[H8163]] daily [[H3117]] for a sin offering; [[H2403]] you are also to provide [[H6213]] a young bull [[H6499]] and a ram [[H352]] from [[H4480]] the flock, [[H6629]] both unblemished. [[H8549]] 
26 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] the priests are to make atonement [[H3722]] for the altar [[H4196]] and cleanse it; [[H2891]] so they shall consecrate [[H4390]] it. [[H3027]] 
27 At the end [[H3615]] of these days, [[H3117]] from the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] on, [[H1973]] the priests [[H3548]] are to present [[H6213]] your burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings [[H8002]] on [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] Then I will accept you, [[H7521]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]
