[[Ezekiel 39|←]] • [[Ezekiel 41|→]]
1 In the twenty-fifth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of our exile, [[H1546]] at the beginning [[H7218]] of the year, [[H8141]] on the tenth [[H6218]] day of the month— [[H2320]] in the fourteenth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] after [[H310]] Jerusalem [[H5892]] had been struck down— [[H5221]] on that [[H2088]] very [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] upon me, [[H5921]] and He took [[H935]] me [[H853]] there. [[H8033]] 
2 In visions [[H4759]] of God [[H430]] He took [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Israel [[H3478]] and set me [[H5117]] on [[H413]] a very [[H3966]] high [[H1364]] mountain, [[H2022]] on whose southern slope [[H5045]] was a structure [[H4011]] that resembled a city. [[H5892]] 
3 So He took [[H935]] me there, [[H8033]] and I saw [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] whose appearance [[H4758]] was like bronze. [[H5178]] He [[H1931]] was standing [[H5975]] in the gateway [[H8179]] with a linen [[H6593]] cord [[H6616]] and a measuring [[H4060]] rod [[H7070]] in his hand. [[H3027]] 
4 “Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] he said [[H1696]] to me, [[H413]] “look [[H7200]] with your eyes, [[H5869]] hear [[H8085]] with your ears, [[H241]] and pay attention [[H7760]] to everything [[H3605]] I [[H589]] am going to show you, [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] that [[H4616]] [is why] [[H7200]] you have been brought [[H935]] here. [[H2008]] Report [[H5046]] everything [[H3605]] you [[H859]] see [[H7200]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel.” [[H3478]] 
5 And I saw [[H2009]] a wall [[H2346]] surrounding [[H5439]] the temple area. [[H1004]] Now the length of the measuring [[H4060]] rod [[H7070]] in the man’s [[H376]] hand [[H3027]] [was] six [long] [[H8337]] cubits [[H520]] ([each measuring a] cubit [[H520]] and a handbreadth), [[H2948]] and he measured [[H4058]] the [wall to be] [[H1146]] one [[H259]] rod [[H7070]] thick [[H7341]] [and] one [[H259]] rod [[H7070]] high. [[H6967]] 
6 Then he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] facing [[H6440]] east [[H6921]] and climbed [[H5927]] its steps. [[H4609]] He measured [[H4058]] the threshold [[H5592]] of the gate [to be] [[H8179]] one [[H259]] rod [[H7070]] deep. [[H7341]] 
7 Each gate chamber [[H8372]] [was] one [[H259]] rod [[H7070]] long [[H753]] and one [rod] [[H7070]] wide, [[H7341]] and [there were] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] between [[H996]] the gate chambers. [[H8372]] The inner threshold [[H5592]] of the gate [[H8179]] by the portico [[H197]] facing inward [[H1004]] [was] one [[H259]] rod [deep]. [[H7070]] 
8 Then he measured [[H4058]] the portico [[H197]] of the gateway [[H8179]] inside; [[H1004]] 
9 [it was] [[H4058]] eight [[H8083]] cubits [deep] [[H520]] and its jambs [were] [[H352]] two [[H8147]] cubits [thick]. [[H520]] And the portico [[H197]] of the gateway [[H8179]] faced [the temple]. [[H1004]] 
10 There were three [[H7969]] gate chambers [[H8372]] on each side [[H6311]] of the east [[H6921]] gate, [[H8179]] each with the same [[H259]] measurements, [[H4060]] and the gateposts [[H352]] on either side [[H6311]] also had the same [[H259]] measurements. [[H4060]] 
11 And he measured [[H4058]] the width [[H7341]] of the gateway [[H8179]] entrance [[H6607]] [to be] ten [[H6235]] cubits, [[H520]] and its length [[H753]] [was] thirteen [[H7969]] cubits. [[H520]] 
12 In front [[H6440]] of each gate chamber [[H8372]] was a wall [[H1366]] one [[H259]] cubit [high], [[H520]] and the gate chambers [[H8372]] [were] six [[H8337]] cubits [[H520]] square. [[H6311]] 
13 Then he measured [[H4058]] the gateway [[H8179]] from the roof [[H1406]] of a gate chamber [[H8372]] to the roof [[H1406]] of the opposite one; [[H7341]] [the distance was] twenty-five [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] from doorway [[H6607]] to [[H5048]] doorway. [[H6607]] 
14 Next he measured [[H6213]] the gateposts [[H352]] [to be] sixty [[H8346]] cubits [high]. [[H520]] The gateway [extended] [[H8179]] around [[H5439]] to [[H413]] the gatepost [[H352]] of the courtyard. [[H2691]] 
15 And the distance from [[H5921]] the entrance [[H2978]] of the gateway [[H8179]] to [[H5921]] the far end of [[H6440]] [its] [[H8179]] inner [[H6442]] portico [[H197]] [was] fifty [[H2572]] cubits. [[H520]] 
16 The gate chambers [[H8372]] and their side pillars [[H352]] had [[H413]] beveled [[H331]] windows [[H2474]] all around [[H5439]] the inside [[H6441]] of the gateway. [[H8179]] The porticos [[H361]] also had windows [[H2474]] all around [[H5439]] on the inside. [[H6441]] Each side pillar [[H352]] was decorated with palm trees. [[H8561]] 
17 Then he brought [[H935]] me into [[H413]] the outer [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] and there [[H2009]] were chambers [[H3957]] and a pavement [[H7531]] laid out [[H6213]] all around [[H5439]] the court. [[H2691]] Thirty [[H7970]] chambers [[H3957]] faced [[H413]] the pavement, [[H7531]] 
18 which flanked [[H3802]] the gateways [[H8179]] and corresponded to [[H5980]] the length [[H753]] of the gates; [[H8179]] this was the lower [[H8481]] pavement. [[H7531]] 
19 Then he measured [[H4058]] the distance [[H7341]] from the front [[H6440]] of the lower [[H8481]] gateway [[H8179]] to the outside [[H2351]] of the inner [[H6442]] court; [[H2691]] it was a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] on the east side [[H6921]] as well as on the north. [[H6828]] 
20 He also measured [[H4058]] the length [[H753]] and width [[H7341]] of the gateway [[H8179]] of the outer [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] facing [[H6440]] north. [[H6828]] 
21 Its three [[H7969]] gate chambers [[H8372]] on each side, [[H6311]] its side pillars, [[H352]] and its portico [[H361]] all had [[H1961]] the same measurements [[H4060]] as the first [[H7223]] gate: [[H8179]] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and twenty-five [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] 
22 Its windows, [[H2474]] portico, [[H361]] and palm trees [[H8561]] had the same measurements [[H4060]] as those of the gate [[H8179]] facing [[H6440]] east. [[H6921]] Seven [[H7651]] steps [[H4609]] led up to it, [[H5927]] with its portico [[H361]] opposite them. [[H6440]] 
23 There was a gate [[H8179]] to the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] facing [[H5048]] the north [[H6828]] gate, [[H8179]] just as there was on the east. [[H6921]] He measured the distance [[H4058]] from gateway [[H8179]] to [[H413]] gateway [[H8179]] [to be] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits. [[H520]] 
24 Then he led [[H1980]] me to [[H1870]] the south side, [[H1864]] and I saw [[H2009]] a gateway [[H8179]] facing [[H1870]] south. [[H1864]] He measured [[H4058]] its side pillars [[H352]] and portico, [[H361]] and they had the same measurements [[H4060]] as the others. [[H428]] 
25 Both the gateway and its portico [[H361]] had windows [[H2474]] all around, [[H5439]] like the other [[H428]] windows. [[H2474]] [It was] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and twenty-five [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] 
26 Seven [[H7651]] steps [[H4609]] led up to it, [[H5930]] and its portico [[H361]] was opposite them; [[H6440]] it had palm trees [[H8561]] on [[H413]] its side pillars, [[H352]] one [[H259]] on each side. [[H6311]] 
27 The inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] also had a gate [[H8179]] facing [[H1870]] south, [[H1864]] and he measured [[H4058]] [the distance] from gateway [[H8179]] to [[H413]] gateway [[H8179]] toward [[H1870]] the south [[H1864]] [to be] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits. [[H520]] 
28 Next he brought me [[H935]] into [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] through the south [[H1864]] gate, [[H8179]] and he measured [[H4058]] the south [[H1864]] gate; [[H8179]] it had the same measurements [[H4060]] as the others. [[H428]] 
29 Its gate chambers, [[H8372]] side pillars, [[H352]] and portico [[H361]] had the same measurements [[H4060]] as the others. [[H428]] Both the gateway and its portico [[H361]] had windows [[H2474]] all around; [[H5439]] it [was] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and twenty-five [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] 
30 (There were porticoes [[H361]] all around, [[H5439]] twenty-five [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] wide.) [[H7341]] 
31 Its portico [[H361]] faced [[H413]] the outer [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] and its side pillars [[H352]] were decorated with palm trees. [[H8561]] Eight [[H8083]] steps [[H4609]] led up to it. [[H4608]] 
32 And he brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] on [[H1870]] the east side, [[H6921]] and he measured [[H4058]] the gateway; [[H8179]] it had the same measurements [[H4060]] as the others. [[H428]] 
33 Its gate chambers, [[H8372]] side pillars, [[H352]] and portico [[H361]] had the same measurements [[H4060]] as the others. [[H428]] Both [the gateway] and its portico [[H361]] had windows [[H2474]] all around. [[H5439]] It [was] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and twenty-five [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] 
34 Its portico [[H361]] faced the outer [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] and its side pillars [[H352]] were decorated with palm trees [[H8561]] on each side. [[H6311]] Eight [[H8083]] steps [[H4609]] led up to it. [[H4608]] 
35 Then he brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the north [[H6828]] gate [[H8179]] and measured [it]. [[H4058]] It had the same measurements [[H4060]] as the others, [[H428]] 
36 as did its gate chambers, [[H8372]] side pillars, [[H352]] and portico. [[H361]] It also had windows [[H2474]] all around. [[H5439]] [It was] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] twenty-five [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] 
37 Its portico [[H352]] faced the outer [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] and its side pillars [[H352]] were decorated with palm trees [[H8561]] on each side. [[H6311]] Eight [[H8083]] steps [[H4609]] led up to it. [[H4608]] 
38 There was a chamber [[H3957]] with a doorway [[H6607]] by the portico [[H352]] in each of the inner gateways. [[H8179]] There [[H8033]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] was to be washed. [[H1740]] 
39 Inside the portico [[H197]] of the gateway [[H8179]] [were] two [[H8147]] tables [[H7979]] on each side, [[H6311]] on which [[H413]] the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] sin offerings, [[H2403]] and guilt offerings [[H817]] were to be slaughtered. [[H7819]] 
40 Outside, [[H2351]] as one goes up [[H5927]] to the entrance [[H6607]] of the north [[H6828]] gate, [[H8179]] there were two [[H8147]] tables [[H7979]] on [[H413]] one side [[H3802]] and two [[H8147]] more tables [[H7979]] on [[H413]] the other [[H312]] side [[H3802]] of the gate’s [[H8179]] portico. [[H197]] 
41 So there were four [[H702]] tables [[H7979]] inside the gateway [[H8179]] and four [[H702]] outside— [[H6311]] eight [[H8083]] tables [[H7979]] in all— [[H413]] on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered. [[H7819]] 
42 There were also four [[H702]] tables [[H7979]] of dressed stone [[H68]] for the burnt offering, [[H5930]] each a cubit [[H520]] and a [[H259]] half [[H2677]] long, [[H753]] a cubit [[H520]] and a [[H259]] half [[H2677]] wide, [[H7341]] and a [[H259]] cubit [[H520]] high. [[H1363]] On these [[H413]] were placed [[H3240]] the utensils [[H3627]] used to slaughter [[H7819]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] and other sacrifices. [[H2077]] 
43 The double-pronged hooks, [[H8240]] each a [[H259]] handbreadth [long], [[H2948]] were fastened [[H3559]] all around [[H5439]] the inside of the room, [[H1004]] and the flesh [[H1320]] of the offering [[H7133]] was to be placed on [[H413]] the tables. [[H7979]] 
44 Outside [[H2351]] the inner [[H6442]] gate, [[H8179]] within the inner [[H6442]] court, [[H2691]] were two chambers, [[H3957]] one [[H7891]] beside [[H413]] the north [[H6828]] gate [[H8179]] and facing [[H6440]] south, [[H1864]] and another [[H259]] beside [[H413]] the south gate [[H8179]] and facing [[H6440]] north. [[H6828]] 
45 Then the man said [[H1696]] to me: [[H413]] “The [[H2090]] chamber [[H3957]] that [[H834]] faces [[H6440]] south [[H1864]] is for the priests [[H3548]] who have [[H8104]] charge [[H4931]] of the temple, [[H1004]] 
46 and the chamber [[H3957]] that [[H834]] faces [[H6440]] north [[H6828]] is for the priests [[H3548]] who have [[H8104]] charge [[H4931]] of the altar. [[H4196]] These [[H1992]] are the sons [[H1121]] of Zadok, [[H6659]] the [only] Levites [[H3878]] who may approach [[H7131]] the LORD [[H3068]] to minister before Him.” [[H8334]] 
47 Next he measured [[H4058]] the court. [[H2691]] It was square, [[H7251]] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] And the altar [was] [[H4196]] in front [[H6440]] of the temple. [[H1004]] 
48 Then he brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the portico [[H197]] of the temple [[H1004]] and measured [[H4058]] the side pillars [[H352]] of the portico [[H197]] [to be] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] on each [[H6311]] side. [[H6311]] The width [[H7341]] of the gateway was fourteen cubits and its sidewalls [[H8179]] were three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] on either side. [[H6311]] 
49 The portico [[H197]] [was] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide [[H753]] and twelve [[H6249]] cubits [[H520]] deep, [[H7341]] and [ten] steps [[H4609]] led up [[H5927]] to it. [[H413]] There were columns [[H5982]] by [[H413]] the side pillars, [[H352]] one [[H259]] on each side. [[H6311]]
