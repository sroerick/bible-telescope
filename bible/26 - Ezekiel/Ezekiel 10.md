# Ezekiel 10
[[Ezekiel 9|←]] • [[Ezekiel 11|→]]
1 And I looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] above [[H413]] the expanse, [[H7549]] above [[H5921]] the heads [[H7218]] of the cherubim, [[H3742]] the likeness [[H1823]] of a throne [[H3678]] of sapphire. [[H5601]] 
2 And the LORD said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] clothed [[H3847]] in linen, [[H906]] “Go [[H935]] inside [[H413]] the wheelwork [[H1534]] beneath [[H8478]] the cherubim. [[H3742]] Fill [[H4390]] your hands [[H2651]] with burning coals [[H1513]] from among [[H996]] the cherubim [[H3742]] and scatter [[H2236]] them over [[H5921]] the city.” [[H5892]] And as I watched, [[H5869]] he went in. [[H935]] 
3 Now when the man [[H376]] went in, [[H935]] the cherubim [[H3742]] were standing [[H5975]] on the south side [[H3225]] of the temple, [[H1004]] and a cloud [[H6051]] filled [[H4390]] the inner [[H6442]] court. [[H2691]] 
4 Then the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3069]] rose [[H7311]] from above [[H5921]] the cherubim [[H3742]] [and stood] over [[H5921]] the threshold [[H4670]] of the temple. [[H1004]] The temple [[H1004]] was filled [[H4390]] with the cloud, [[H6051]] and the court [[H2691]] was filled [[H4390]] with the brightness [[H5051]] of the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD. [[H3069]] 
5 The sound [[H6963]] of the wings [[H3671]] of the cherubim [[H3742]] could be heard [[H8085]] as [[H5704]] far as the outer [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] like the voice [[H6963]] of God [[H410]] Almighty [[H7706]] when He speaks. [[H1696]] 
6 When [[H1961]] the LORD commanded [[H6680]] the man [[H376]] clothed [[H3847]] in linen, [[H906]] saying, [[H559]] “Take [[H3947]] fire [[H784]] from within [[H996]] the wheelwork, [[H1534]] from among [[H996]] the cherubim,” [[H3742]] the man went in [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] a wheel. [[H212]] 
7 Then one of the cherubim [[H3742]] reached out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] and took [some of] [[H5375]] the fire [[H784]] that [[H834]] was among them, [[H996]] and he put [[H5414]] it into [[H413]] the hands [[H2651]] of the man clothed [[H3847]] in linen, [[H906]] who received it [[H3947]] and left. [[H3318]] 
8 (The cherubim [[H3742]] appeared [[H7200]] to have the form [[H8403]] of human [[H120]] hands [[H3027]] under [[H8478]] their wings.) [[H3671]] 
9 Then I looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] four [[H702]] wheels [[H212]] beside [[H681]] the cherubim, [[H3742]] one [[H259]] wheel [[H212]] beside [[H681]] each [[H259]] cherub. [[H3742]] [And] [[H4758]] the wheels [[H212]] gleamed [[H5869]] like a beryl [[H8658]] stone. [[H68]] 
10 [As for] their appearance, [[H4758]] all four [[H702]] had the same [[H259]] form, [[H1823]] like [[H834]] a wheel [[H212]] within [[H8432]] a wheel. [[H212]] 
11 When they moved, [[H1980]] they would go [[H1980]] in [[H413]] any of the four [[H702]] directions, [[H7253]] without [[H3808]] turning [[H5437]] as they moved. [[H1980]] But [[H3588]] wherever [[H4725]] the head [[H7218]] faced, [[H6437]] they would go [[H1980]] in that direction, [[H310]] without [[H3808]] turning [[H5437]] as they went. [[H1980]] 
12 Their entire [[H3605]] bodies, [[H1320]] including their backs, [[H1354]] hands, [[H3027]] and wings, [[H3671]] were full of [[H4392]] eyes [[H5869]] all around, [[H5439]] as were their four [[H702]] wheels. [[H212]] 
13 I heard [[H241]] the wheels [[H212]] being called [[H7121]] “the whirling wheels.” [[H1534]] 
14 Each [of the cherubim] [[H259]] had four [[H702]] faces: [[H6440]] the first [[H259]] face [[H6440]] was that [[H6440]] of a cherub, [[H3742]] the second [[H8145]] that [[H6440]] of a man, [[H120]] the third [[H7992]] that [[H6440]] of a lion, [[H738]] and the fourth [[H7243]] that [[H6440]] of an eagle. [[H5404]] 
15 Then the cherubim [[H3742]] rose upward. [[H7426]] These [[H1931]] were the living creatures [[H2416]] I had seen [[H7200]] by the River [[H5104]] Kebar. [[H3529]] 
16 When the cherubim [[H3742]] moved, [[H1980]] the wheels [[H212]] moved [[H1980]] beside them, [[H681]] [and even when they] [[H3742]] spread [[H5375]] their wings [[H3671]] to rise [[H7311]] from [[H5921]] the ground, [[H776]] the wheels [[H212]] did not [[H3808]] veer away [[H5437]] from their side. [[H681]] 
17 When the cherubim stood still, [[H5975]] the wheels also stood still, [[H5975]] and when they ascended, [[H7311]] the wheels ascended [[H7426]] with them, [[H853]] for [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the living creatures [[H2416]] was in them.  
18 Then the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] moved away [[H3318]] from over [[H5921]] the threshold [[H4670]] of the temple [[H1004]] and stood [[H5975]] above [[H5921]] the cherubim. [[H3742]] 
19 As I watched, [[H5869]] the cherubim [[H3742]] lifted [[H5375]] their wings [[H3671]] and rose up [[H7426]] from [[H4480]] the ground, [[H776]] with the wheels [[H212]] beside [[H5980]] them as they went. [[H3318]] And they stopped [[H5975]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the east [[H6931]] gate [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] with the glory [[H3519]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] above [[H5921]] them. [[H4605]] 
20 These [[H1931]] were the living creatures [[H2416]] I had seen [[H7200]] beneath [[H8478]] the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] by the River [[H5104]] Kebar, [[H3529]] and I knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] were cherubim. [[H3742]] 
21 Each [[H259]] had four [[H702]] faces [[H6440]] and [[H259]] four [[H702]] wings, [[H3671]] with what looked like [[H1823]] human [[H120]] hands [[H3027]] under [[H8478]] their wings. [[H3671]] 
22 Their faces [[H6440]] looked like [[H1823]] the faces [[H6440]] I had seen [[H7200]] by [[H5921]] the River [[H5104]] Kebar. [[H3529]] Each [[H376]] creature went [[H1980]] straight ahead. [[H413]]
