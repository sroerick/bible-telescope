# Ezekiel 21
[[Ezekiel 20|←]] • [[Ezekiel 22|→]]
1 And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] your face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and preach [[H5197]] against [[H413]] the sanctuaries. [[H4720]] Prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel [[H3478]] 
3 and tell [[H559]] [her] [[H3478]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I am against you, [[H413]] and I will draw [[H3318]] My sword [[H2719]] from its sheath [[H8593]] and cut off [[H3772]] from you [[H4480]] both the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked. [[H7563]] 
4 Because [[H3282]] I will cut off [[H3772]] both the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked, [[H7563]] My sword [[H2719]] will be [[H3318]] unsheathed [[H8593]] against [[H413]] everyone [[H3605]] from south [[H5045]] to north. [[H6828]] 
5 Then all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have taken [[H3318]] My sword [[H2719]] from its sheath, [[H8593]] not [[H3808]] to return it [[H7725]] again.’ [[H5750]] 
6 But you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] groan! [[H584]] Groan [[H584]] before their eyes [[H5869]] with a broken [[H7670]] heart [[H4975]] and bitter grief. [[H4814]] 
7 And when [[H3588]] they ask, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H5921]] are you [[H859]] groaning?’ [[H584]] you are to say, [[H559]] ‘Because of [[H413]] the news [[H8052]] that [[H3588]] is coming. [[H935]] Every [[H3605]] heart [[H3820]] will melt, [[H4549]] and every [[H3605]] hand [[H3027]] will go limp. [[H7503]] Every [[H3605]] spirit [[H7307]] will faint, [[H3543]] and every [[H3605]] knee [[H1290]] will turn to [[H1980]] water.’ [[H4325]] Yes, [[H2009]] it is coming [[H935]] and it will surely happen, [[H1961]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
8 Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
9 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] and tell them [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] says: [[H559]] ‘A sword, [[H2719]] a sword, [[H2719]] sharpened [[H2300]] and [[H1571]] polished— [[H4803]] 
10 it is sharpened [[H2300]] for [[H4616]] the slaughter, [[H2873]] polished [[H4803]] to flash like lightning! [[H1300]] Should we rejoice [[H7797]] in the scepter [[H7626]] of My son? [[H1121]] The sword despises [[H3988]] every [[H3605]] tree. [[H6086]] 
11 The sword [[H2719]] is appointed [[H5414]] to be polished, [[H4803]] to be grasped [[H8610]] in the hand. [[H3709]] It [[H1931]] is sharpened [[H2300]] and [[H1931]] polished, [[H4803]] to be placed [[H5414]] in the hand [[H3027]] of the slayer. [[H2026]] 
12 Cry out [[H2199]] and wail, [[H3213]] O son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is [[H1961]] against My people; [[H5971]] it [[H1931]] is against all [[H3605]] the princes [[H5387]] of Israel! [[H3478]] They are [[H1961]] tossed [[H4048]] to [[H413]] the sword [[H2719]] with [[H854]] My people; [[H5971]] therefore [[H3651]] strike [[H5606]] your thigh. [[H3409]] 
13 Surely [[H3588]] a trial will come! [[H974]] And what [[H4100]] if [[H518]] even [[H1571]] the scepter, [[H7626]] [which the] [sword] despises, [[H3988]] does not [[H3808]] continue? [[H1961]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
14 So then, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] and strike [[H5221]] your hands together. [[H3709]] Let the sword [[H2719]] strike two times, [[H3717]] even three. [[H7992]] It [[H1931]] is a sword [[H2719]] [that] slays, [[H2491]] a sword [[H2719]] that slays [[H2491]] the great— [[H1419]] it surrounds them! [[H2314]] 
15 So that [[H4616]] their hearts [[H3820]] may melt [[H4127]] and many [[H7235]] may stumble, [[H4383]] I have appointed [[H5414]] at [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] their gates [[H8179]] a sword [[H2719]] for slaughter. [[H19]] Yes, [[H253]] it is ready [[H6213]] to flash like lightning; [[H1300]] it is drawn [[H4593]] for slaughter. [[H2875]] 
16 Slash [[H258]] to the right; [[H3231]] set your blade [[H7760]] to the left— [[H8041]] wherever [[H575]] your blade [[H6440]] is directed. [[H3259]] 
17 I [[H589]] too [[H1571]] will strike [[H5221]] My hands together, [[H3709]] and I will satisfy [[H5117]] My wrath. [[H2534]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken.’” [[H1696]] 
18 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
19 “Now you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] mark out [[H7760]] two [[H8147]] roads [[H1870]] for the sword [[H2719]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] to take, [[H935]] both [[H8147]] starting [[H3318]] from the same [[H259]] land. [[H776]] And make [[H1254]] a signpost [[H3027]] where the road [[H1870]] branches off [[H7218]] to each city. [[H5892]] 
20 Mark out [[H7760]] one road [[H1870]] for the sword [[H2719]] to come [[H935]] against Rabbah [[H7237]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] and [another] [[H853]] against Judah [[H3063]] into fortified [[H1219]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
21 For [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] stands [[H5975]] at [[H413]] the fork [[H517]] in the road, [[H1870]] at the junction [[H7218]] of the two [[H8147]] roads, [[H1870]] to seek [[H7080]] an omen: [[H7081]] He shakes [[H7043]] the arrows, [[H2671]] he consults [[H7592]] the idols, [[H8655]] he examines [[H7200]] the liver. [[H3516]] 
22 In his right hand [[H3225]] appears [[H1961]] the portent [[H7081]] for Jerusalem, [[H3389]] where he is to set up [[H7760]] battering rams, [[H3733]] to call for [[H6605]] the slaughter, [[H7524]] to lift [[H7311]] a battle cry, [[H6963]] to set [[H7760]] the battering rams [[H3733]] against [[H5921]] the gates, [[H8179]] to build [[H8210]] a ramp, [[H5550]] and to erect [[H1129]] a siege wall. [[H1785]] 
23 It will seem [[H1961]] like  a false [[H7080]] omen [[H7080]] to the eyes [[H5869]] of those who have sworn [[H7650]] allegiance to him, [[H7621]] but it [[H1931]] will draw attention [[H2142]] to their guilt [[H5771]] and take them captive. [[H8610]] 
24 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you have drawn attention [[H2142]] to your guilt, [[H5771]] exposing [[H1540]] your transgressions, [[H6588]] so that your sins [[H2403]] are revealed [[H7200]] in all [[H3605]] your deeds— [[H5949]] because [[H3282]] you have come to remembrance, [[H2142]] you shall be taken [[H8610]] in hand. [[H3709]] 
25 And you, [[H859]] O profane [[H2491]] and wicked [[H7563]] prince [[H5387]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the day [[H3117]] has come [[H935]] for your final punishment.’ [[H5771]] 
26 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Remove [[H5493]] the turban, [[H4701]] and take off [[H7311]] the crown. [[H5850]] Things [[H2063]] will not remain as they are: [[H3808]] Exalt [[H1361]] the lowly [[H8217]] and bring low [[H8213]] the exalted. [[H1364]] 
27 A ruin, [[H5754]] a ruin, [[H5754]] I will make it [[H7760]] a ruin! [[H5754]] And [[H1571]] it [[H2063]] will not [[H3808]] be restored [[H1961]] until [[H5704]] He comes [[H935]] to whom [[H834]] it belongs,  to whom I have assigned [[H5414]] judgment.’ [[H4941]] 
28 Now [[H859]] prophesy, [[H5012]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] and declare [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] concerning [[H413]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] and their contempt: [[H2781]] ‘A sword! [[H2719]] A sword [[H2719]] is drawn [[H6605]] for slaughter, [[H2874]] polished [[H4803]] to consume, [[H398]] to [[H4616]] flash like lightning. [[H1300]] 
29 While they offer false [[H7723]] visions [[H2372]] for you  and lying [[H3577]] divinations [[H7080]] about you,  to be placed [[H5414]] on [[H413]] the necks [[H6677]] of the wicked [[H7563]] who are slain, [[H2491]] whose [[H834]] day [[H3117]] has come— [[H935]] the time [[H6256]] of their final punishment. [[H5771]] 
30 Return [the sword] [[H7725]] to [[H413]] its sheath! [[H8593]] In the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] you were created, [[H1254]] in the land [[H776]] of your origin, [[H4351]] I will judge [[H8199]] you. [[H853]] 
31 I will pour out [[H8210]] My anger [[H2195]] upon you; [[H5921]] I will breath [[H6315]] the fire [[H784]] of My fury [[H5678]] against you; [[H5921]] I will hand you over to [[H5414]] brutal [[H1197]] men, [[H376]] skilled [[H2796]] in destruction. [[H4889]] 
32 You will be [[H1961]] fuel [[H402]] for the fire. [[H784]] Your blood [[H1818]] will stain [[H1961]] your own [[H8432]] land. [[H776]] You will not [[H3808]] be remembered, [[H2142]] for [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken.’” [[H1696]]
