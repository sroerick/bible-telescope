# Ezekiel 18
[[Ezekiel 17|←]] • [[Ezekiel 19|→]]
1 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “What [[H4100]] do you people [[H859]] mean  by quoting this [[H2088]] proverb [[H4911]] about [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel: [[H3478]] ‘The fathers [[H1]] eat [[H398]] sour grapes, [[H1155]] but the children’s [[H1121]] teeth [[H8127]] are set on edge’? [[H6949]] 
3 As surely as [[H589]] I live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] you will no [[H518]] longer [[H5750]] quote [[H4911]] this [[H2088]] proverb [[H4912]] in Israel. [[H3478]] 
4 Behold, [[H2005]] every [[H3605]] soul [[H5315]] belongs to Me;  both father [[H1]] [and] [[H5315]] son [[H1121]] are [[H2007]] Mine.  The soul [[H5315]] who sins [[H2398]] is the one who [[H1931]] will die. [[H4191]] 
5 Now suppose [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] is [[H1961]] righteous [[H6662]] and does [[H6213]] what is just [[H4941]] and right: [[H6666]] 
6 ‘He does not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] at [[H413]] the mountain [[H2022]] or look [[H5375]] to [[H413]] the idols [[H1544]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] He does not [[H3808]] defile [[H2930]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife [[H802]] or [[H3808]] approach [[H7126]] a woman [[H802]] during her period. [[H5079]] 
7 He does not [[H3808]] oppress [[H3238]] another, [[H376]] but returns [[H7725]] his pledge [[H2258]] to the debtor. [[H2326]] He does not [[H3808]] commit [[H1497]] robbery, [[H1500]] but gives [[H5414]] his bread [[H3899]] to the hungry [[H7457]] and covers [[H3680]] the naked [[H5903]] with clothing. [[H899]] 
8 He does not [[H3808]] engage [[H5414]] in usury [[H5392]] [or] [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] excess interest, [[H8636]] but he keeps his hand [[H3027]] from iniquity [[H5766]] [and] executes [[H6213]] TRUE [[H571]] justice [[H4941]] between [[H996]] men. [[H376]] 
9 He follows [[H1980]] My statutes [[H2708]] and faithfully [[H571]] keeps [[H8104]] My ordinances; [[H4941]] he is righteous; [[H6662]] surely [[H2421]] he will live,’ [[H2421]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
10 Now suppose [that man] has [[H3205]] a violent [[H6530]] son, [[H1121]] who sheds [[H8210]] blood [[H1818]] or does [[H6213]] any [[H259]] of these [things], [[H428]] 
11 though the father [[H1931]] has done [[H6213]] none [[H3605]] of them: [[H428]] ‘Indeed, [[H1571]] the son eats [[H398]] at [[H413]] the mountain [[H2022]] and defiles [[H2930]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife. [[H802]] 
12 He oppresses [[H3238]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy, [[H34]] he commits robbery [[H1500]] and does not [[H3808]] restore [[H7725]] a pledge. [[H2258]] He lifts [[H5375]] his eyes [[H5869]] to [[H413]] idols; [[H1544]] he commits [[H6213]] abominations. [[H8441]] 
13 He engages [[H5414]] in usury [[H5392]] and takes [[H3947]] excess interest.’ [[H8636]] Will [this son] live? [[H2425]] He will not! [[H3808]] Since he has committed [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] abominations, [[H8441]] he will surely die; [[H4191]] his blood [[H1818]] will be [[H1961]] on his own head.  
14 Now [[H2009]] suppose [this son] has [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] who sees [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] his father [[H1]] has committed, [[H6213]] considers them, [[H7200]] and does not [[H3808]] do likewise: [[H6213]] 
15 ‘He does not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] at [[H5921]] the mountain [[H2022]] or look [[H5375]] to [[H413]] the idols [[H1544]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] He does not [[H3808]] defile [[H2930]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife. [[H802]] 
16 He does not [[H3808]] oppress [[H3238]] another, [[H376]] or retain [[H2254]] a pledge, [[H2258]] or commit [[H1497]] robbery. [[H1500]] He gives [[H5414]] his bread [[H3899]] to the hungry [[H7457]] and covers [[H3680]] the naked [[H5903]] with clothing. [[H899]] 
17 He withholds [[H7725]] his hand [[H3027]] from iniquity [[H6041]] and takes [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] interest [[H5392]] or usury. [[H8636]] He [[H1931]] keeps [[H6213]] My ordinances [[H4941]] and follows [[H1980]] My statutes.’ [[H2708]] Such a man will not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] for his father’s [[H1]] iniquity. [[H5771]] He will surely live. [[H2421]] 
18 As for his father, [[H1]] he will die [[H4191]] for his own iniquity, [[H5771]] because [[H3588]] he practiced [[H6231]] extortion, [[H6233]] robbed [[H1497]] his brother, [[H251]] and did [[H6213]] what [[H834]] was wrong [[H3808]] among [[H8432]] his people. [[H5971]] 
19 Yet you may ask, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H4069]] should the son [[H1121]] not [[H3808]] bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the father?’ [[H1]] Since the son [[H1121]] has done [[H6213]] what is just [[H4941]] and right, [[H6666]] carefully [[H8104]] observing [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] My statutes, [[H2708]] he will surely live. [[H2421]] 
20 The soul [[H5315]] who sins [[H2398]] is the one who [[H1931]] will die. [[H4191]] A son [[H1121]] will not [[H3808]] bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the father, [[H1]] and a father [[H1]] will not [[H3808]] bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the son. [[H1121]] The righteousness [[H6666]] of the righteous man [[H6662]] will fall [[H1961]] upon him, [[H5921]] and the wickedness [[H7564]] of the wicked man [[H7563]] will fall [[H1961]] upon him. [[H5921]] 
21 But if [[H3588]] the wicked man [[H7563]] turns [[H7725]] from all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] he has committed, [[H6213]] keeps [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] My statutes, [[H2708]] and does [[H6213]] what is just [[H4941]] and right, [[H6666]] he will surely live; [[H2421]] he will not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] 
22 None [[H3605]] of the transgressions [[H6588]] he has committed [[H6213]] will be held against him. [[H2142]] Because of the righteousness [[H6666]] he has practiced, [[H6213]] he will live. [[H2421]] 
23 Do I take any pleasure [[H2654]] in the death [[H4194]] of the wicked? [[H7563]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] Would I not prefer [[H3808]] he turn [[H7725]] from his ways [[H1870]] and live? [[H2421]] 
24 But when a righteous man [[H6662]] turns [[H7725]] from his righteousness [[H6666]] and practices [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] committing [[H6213]] the same abominations [[H8441]] as [[H834]] the wicked, [[H7563]] will he live? [[H2425]] None [[H3605]] of the righteous acts [[H6666]] he did [[H6213]] will be remembered. [[H2142]] Because of the unfaithfulness [[H4604]] and sin [[H2403]] he has committed, [[H2398]] he will die. [[H4191]] 
25 Yet you say, [[H559]] ‘The way [[H1870]] of the Lord [[H136]] is not [[H3808]] just.’ [[H8505]] Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]] Is it My way [[H1870]] that is unjust? [[H3808]] Is it not your ways [[H1870]] that are unjust? [[H3808]] 
26 When a righteous man [[H6662]] turns [[H7725]] from his righteousness [[H6666]] and practices [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] he will die [[H4191]] for this. [[H5921]] He will die [[H4191]] because of the iniquity [[H5766]] he has committed. [[H6213]] 
27 But if a wicked man [[H7563]] turns [[H7725]] from the wickedness [[H7564]] he has committed [[H6213]] and does [[H6213]] what is just [[H4941]] and right, [[H6666]] he [[H1931]] will save [[H2421]] his life. [[H5315]] 
28 Because he considered [[H7200]] and turned [[H7725]] from all [[H3605]] the transgressions [[H6588]] he had committed, [[H6213]] he will surely live; [[H2421]] he will not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] 
29 Yet the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] says, [[H559]] ‘The way [[H1870]] of the Lord [[H136]] is not [[H3808]] just.’ [[H8505]] Are My ways [[H1870]] unjust, [[H3808]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel? [[H3478]] Is it not your ways [[H1870]] that are unjust? [[H3808]] 
30 Therefore, [[H3651]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I will judge [[H8199]] you, [[H853]] each [[H376]] according to his ways, [[H1870]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3068]] Repent [[H7725]] and turn [[H7725]] from all [[H3605]] your transgressions, [[H6588]] so that your iniquity [[H5771]] will not [[H3808]] become [[H1961]] your downfall. [[H4383]] 
31 Cast away [[H7993]] from yourselves [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the transgressions [[H6588]] you have committed, [[H6586]] and fashion [[H6213]] for yourselves  a new [[H2319]] heart [[H3820]] and a new [[H2319]] spirit. [[H7307]] Why [[H4100]] should you die, [[H4191]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel? [[H3478]] 
32 For [[H3588]] I take no [[H3808]] pleasure [[H2654]] in anyone’s death, [[H4194]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] So repent [[H7725]] and live! [[H2421]]
