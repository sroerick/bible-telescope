# Ezekiel 28
[[Ezekiel 27|←]] • [[Ezekiel 29|→]]
1 And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] tell [[H559]] the ruler [[H5057]] of Tyre [[H6865]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Your heart [[H3820]] is proud, [[H1361]] and you have said, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] am a god; [[H410]] I sit [[H3427]] in the seat [[H4186]] of gods [[H430]] in the heart [[H3820]] of the sea.” [[H3220]] Yet you [[H859]] are a man [[H120]] and not [[H3808]] a god, [[H410]] though you have regarded [[H5414]] your heart [[H3820]] as that [[H3820]] of a god. [[H430]] 
3 Behold, [[H2009]] you [[H859]] are wiser [[H2450]] than Daniel; [[H1840]] no [[H3808]] secret [[H5640]] is hidden from you! [[H6004]] 
4 By your wisdom [[H2451]] and understanding [[H8394]] you have gained [[H6213]] your  wealth [[H2428]] and amassed [[H6213]] gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] for your treasuries. [[H214]] 
5 By your great [[H7230]] skill [[H2451]] in trading [[H7404]] you have increased [[H7235]] your wealth, [[H2428]] but your heart [[H3824]] has grown proud [[H1361]] because of [it].’ [[H2428]] 
6 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you regard [[H5414]] your heart [[H3824]] as the heart [[H3820]] of a god, [[H430]] 
7 behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] foreigners [[H2114]] against you, [[H5921]] the most ruthless [[H6184]] of nations. [[H1471]] They will draw [[H7324]] their swords [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] the beauty [[H3308]] of your wisdom [[H2451]] and will defile [[H2490]] your splendor. [[H3314]] 
8 They will bring you down [[H3381]] to the Pit, [[H7845]] and you will die [[H4191]] a violent [[H2491]] death [[H4463]] in the heart [[H3820]] of the seas. [[H3220]] 
9 Will you still say, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] am a god,” [[H430]] in the presence [[H6440]] of those who slay you? [[H2026]] You [[H859]] will be only a man, [[H120]] not [[H3808]] a god, [[H410]] in the hands [[H3027]] of those who wound you. [[H2490]] 
10 You will die [[H4191]] the death [[H4194]] of the uncircumcised [[H6189]] at the hands [[H3027]] of foreigners. [[H2114]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have spoken, [[H1696]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]] 
11 Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
12 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take up [[H5375]] a lament [[H7015]] for [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Tyre [[H6865]] and tell [[H559]] him  that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘You [[H859]] were the seal [[H2856]] of perfection, [[H8508]] full of [[H4392]] wisdom [[H2451]] and perfect [[H3632]] in beauty. [[H3308]] 
13 You were [[H1961]] in Eden, [[H5731]] the garden [[H1588]] of God. [[H430]] Every kind [[H3605]] of precious [[H3368]] stone [[H68]] adorned you: [[H4540]] ruby, [[H124]] topaz, [[H6357]] and diamond, [[H3095]] beryl, [[H8658]] onyx, [[H7718]] and jasper, [[H3471]] sapphire, [[H5601]] turquoise, [[H5306]] and emerald. [[H1304]] Your mountings [[H5345]] and settings [[H8596]] were crafted [[H4399]] in gold, [[H2091]] prepared [[H3559]] on the day [[H3117]] of your creation. [[H1254]] 
14 You [[H859]] were anointed [[H4473]] as a guardian [[H5526]] cherub, [[H3742]] for I had ordained you. [[H5414]] You were [[H1961]] on the holy [[H6944]] mountain [[H2022]] of God; [[H430]] you walked [[H1980]] among [[H8432]] the fiery [[H784]] stones. [[H68]] 
15 From the day [[H3117]] you were created [[H1254]] you [[H859]] were blameless [[H8549]] in your ways [[H1870]] until [[H5704]] wickedness [[H5766]] was found in you. [[H4672]] 
16 By the vastness [[H7230]] of your trade, [[H7404]] you [[H8432]] were filled [[H4390]] with violence, [[H2555]] and you sinned. [[H2398]] So I drove you in disgrace [[H2490]] from the mountain [[H2022]] of God, [[H430]] and I banished you, [[H6]] O guardian [[H5526]] cherub, [[H3742]] from among [[H8432]] the fiery [[H784]] stones. [[H68]] 
17 Your heart [[H3820]] grew proud [[H1361]] of your beauty; [[H3308]] you corrupted [[H7843]] your wisdom [[H2451]] because [[H5921]] of your splendor; [[H3314]] so I cast you [[H7993]] to [[H5921]] the earth; [[H776]] I made you [[H5414]] a spectacle [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] kings. [[H4428]] 
18 By the multitude [[H7230]] of your iniquities [[H5771]] and the dishonesty [[H5766]] of your trading [[H7404]] you have profaned [[H2490]] your sanctuaries. [[H4720]] So I made fire [[H784]] come [[H3318]] from within you, [[H8432]] and it [[H1931]] consumed you. [[H398]] I reduced [[H5414]] you to ashes [[H665]] on [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] who saw you. [[H7200]] 
19 All [[H3605]] the nations [[H5971]] who know you [[H3045]] are appalled [[H8074]] over you. [[H5921]] You have come [[H1961]] to a horrible end [[H1091]] and [will] [be] no more.’” [[H369]] 
20 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
21 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] turn [[H7760]] your face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] Sidon [[H6721]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against her. [[H5921]] 
22 And you are to declare [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I am against you, [[H5921]] O Sidon, [[H6721]] and I will be glorified [[H3513]] within you. [[H8432]] They will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] when I execute [[H6213]] judgments against her [[H8201]] and demonstrate My holiness through her. [[H6942]] 
23 I will send [[H7971]] a plague against her [[H1698]] and shed blood [[H1818]] in her streets; [[H2351]] the slain [[H2491]] will fall [[H5307]] within her, [[H8432]] while the sword [[H2719]] is against her [[H5921]] on every side. [[H5439]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
24 For the people [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] will [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] longer face [[H5750]] a pricking [[H3992]] brier [[H5544]] or a painful [[H3510]] thorn [[H6975]] from all [[H3605]] around them [[H5439]] who treat them with contempt. [[H7590]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’ [[H3069]] 
25 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘When I gather [[H6908]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] from [[H4480]] the peoples [[H5971]] among whom [[H834]] they have been scattered, [[H6327]] I will show Myself holy [[H6942]] among them  in the sight [[H5869]] of the nations. [[H1471]] Then they will dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] their own land, [[H127]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] to My servant [[H5650]] Jacob. [[H3290]] 
26 They will live there securely, [[H3427]] build [[H1129]] houses, [[H1004]] and plant [[H5193]] vineyards. [[H3754]] They will dwell [[H3427]] securely [[H983]] when I execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] against all [[H3605]] around them [[H5439]] who treat them with contempt. [[H7590]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] their God.’” [[H430]]
