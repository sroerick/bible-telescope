1 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘The gate [[H8179]] of the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] that faces [[H6437]] east [[H6921]] must be [[H1961]] kept shut [[H5462]] during the six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] of work, [[H4639]] but on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day [[H3117]] [and] [[H6605]] on the day [[H3117]] of the New Moon [[H2320]] it shall be opened. [[H6605]] 
2 The prince [[H5387]] is to enter [[H935]] from the outside [[H2351]] through [[H1870]] the portico [[H197]] of the gateway [[H8179]] and stand [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the gatepost, [[H8179]] while the priests [[H3548]] sacrifice [[H6213]] his burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings. [[H8002]] He is to bow in worship [[H7812]] at [[H5921]] the threshold [[H4670]] of the gate [[H8179]] and then depart, [[H3318]] but the gate [[H8179]] must not [[H3808]] be shut [[H5462]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
3 On the Sabbaths [[H7676]] and New Moons [[H2320]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] are also to bow in worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to that [[H1931]] gateway. [[H8179]] 
4 The burnt offering [[H5930]] that [[H834]] the prince [[H5387]] presents [[H7126]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day [[H3117]] [shall] [be] six [[H8337]] unblemished [[H8549]] male lambs [[H3532]] and an unblemished [[H8549]] ram. [[H352]] 
5 The grain offering [[H4503]] with the ram [[H352]] [shall] [be] [one] ephah, [[H374]] and the grain offering [[H4503]] with the lambs [[H3532]] shall be [[H4991]] as much as he is able, [[H3027]] along with a hin [[H1969]] of oil [[H8081]] per ephah. [[H374]] 
6 On the day [[H3117]] of the New Moon [[H2320]] [he shall offer] [[H1961]] a young, [[H1121]] unblemished [[H8549]] bull, [[H6499]] six [[H8337]] lambs, [[H3532]] and a ram [[H352]] without blemish. [[H8549]] 
7 He is to provide [[H6213]] a grain offering [[H4503]] of an ephah [[H374]] with the bull, [[H6499]] an ephah [[H374]] with the ram, [[H352]] and as much [[H834]] as he is able [[H5381]] with the lambs, [[H3532]] along with a hin [[H1969]] of oil [[H8081]] per ephah. [[H374]] 
8 When the prince [[H5387]] enters, [[H935]] he shall go in [[H935]] through [[H1870]] the portico [[H197]] of the gateway, [[H8179]] and he shall go out [[H3318]] the same way. [[H1870]] 
9 When the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] at the appointed feasts, [[H4150]] whoever enters [[H935]] by [[H1870]] the north [[H6828]] gate [[H8179]] to worship [[H7812]] must go out [[H3318]] by [[H1870]] the south [[H5045]] gate, [[H8179]] and whoever enters [[H935]] by [[H1870]] the south [[H5045]] gate [[H8179]] must go out [[H3318]] by [[H1870]] the north [[H6828]] gate. [[H8179]] No one [[H3808]] is to return [[H7725]] through [[H1870]] the gate [[H8179]] by which [[H834]] he entered, [[H935]] but [[H3588]] each must go out [[H3318]] by the opposite gate. [[H5226]] 
10 When the people enter, [[H935]] the prince [[H5387]] shall go in [[H935]] with them, [[H8432]] and when they leave, [[H3318]] he shall leave. [[H3318]] 
11 At the festivals [[H2282]] and appointed feasts, [[H4150]] the grain offering [[H4503]] shall be [[H1961]] an ephah [[H374]] with a bull, [[H6499]] an ephah [[H374]] with a ram, [[H352]] and as much as one is able [[H3027]] to give [[H4991]] with the lambs, [[H3532]] along with a hin [[H1969]] of oil [[H8081]] per ephah. [[H374]] 
12 When [[H3588]] the prince [[H5387]] makes [[H6213]] a freewill offering [[H5071]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] whether a burnt offering [[H5930]] or [[H176]] a peace offering, [[H8002]] the gate [[H8179]] facing [[H6437]] east [[H6921]] must be opened [[H6605]] for him.  He is to offer [[H6213]] his burnt offering [[H5930]] or peace offering [[H8002]] just as [[H834]] he does [[H6213]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]] Then he shall go out, [[H3318]] and the gate [[H8179]] must be closed [[H5462]] after [[H310]] he goes out. [[H3318]] 
13 And you shall provide [[H6213]] an unblemished [[H8549]] lamb [[H3532]] a year-old [[H1121]] as a daily [[H3117]] burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] you are to offer it [[H6213]] every morning. [[H1242]] 
14 You are also to provide [[H6213]] with it [[H5921]] every morning [[H1242]] a grain offering [[H4503]] of a sixth [[H8345]] of an ephah [[H374]] with a third [[H7992]] of a hin [[H1969]] of oil [[H8081]] to moisten [[H7450]] the fine flour— [[H5560]] a grain offering [[H4503]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] This is a perpetual [[H5769]] statute. [[H2708]] 
15 Thus they shall provide [[H6213]] the lamb, [[H3532]] the grain offering, [[H4503]] and the oil [[H8081]] every morning [[H1242]] as a regular [[H8548]] burnt offering.’ [[H5930]] 
16 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘If [[H3588]] the prince [[H5387]] gives [[H5414]] a gift [[H4979]] to any [[H376]] of his sons [[H1121]] as an inheritance, [[H5159]] it [[H1931]] will belong to his descendants. [[H1121]] It will become [[H1961]] their property [[H272]] by inheritance. [[H5159]] 
17 But if [[H3588]] he gives [[H5414]] a gift [[H4979]] from his inheritance [[H5159]] to one [[H259]] of his servants, [[H5650]] it will belong to [[H1961]] that servant until [[H5704]] the year [[H8141]] of freedom; [[H1865]] then it will revert [[H7725]] to the prince. [[H5387]] His inheritance [[H5159]] belongs only [[H389]] to his sons; [[H1121]] it shall be [[H1961]] theirs. [[H1992]] 
18 The prince [[H5387]] must not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] any of the inheritance [[H5159]] of the people [[H5971]] by evicting them [[H3238]] from their property. [[H272]] He is to provide an inheritance [[H5157]] for his sons [[H1121]] from his own property, [[H272]] so that [[H4616]] none [[H3808]] of My people [[H5971]] will be displaced [[H6327]] from his property.’” [[H272]] 
19 Then [the man] brought me [[H935]] through the entrance [[H3996]] at [[H5921]] the side [[H3802]] of the gate [[H8179]] into [[H413]] the holy [[H6944]] chambers [[H3957]] facing [[H6437]] north, [[H6828]] which belonged to the priests, [[H3548]] and he showed me [[H2009]] a place [[H4725]] there [[H8033]] at the far western [[H3220]] end [[H3411]] 
20 and said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “This [[H2088]] is the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the priests [[H3548]] shall boil [[H1310]] the guilt offering [[H817]] and the sin offering, [[H2403]] and where [[H834]] they shall bake [[H644]] the grain offering, [[H4503]] so that they do not [[H1115]] bring [[H3318]] them into [[H413]] the outer [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] and transmit holiness [[H6942]] to the people.” [[H5971]] 
21 Then he brought me [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the outer [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] and led me around to [[H5674]] its [[H2691]] four [[H702]] corners, [[H4740]] and I saw [[H2009]] a separate court [[H2691]] in each of its [[H2691]] corners. [[H4740]] 
22 In the four [[H702]] corners [[H4740]] of the outer court [[H2691]] there were enclosed [[H7000]] courts, [[H2691]] each forty [cubits] [[H705]] long [[H753]] and thirty [cubits] [[H7970]] wide. [[H7341]] Each of the four [[H702]] corner areas [[H7106]] had the same [[H259]] dimensions. [[H4060]] 
23 Around [[H5439]] the inside [[H5439]] of each  of the four [courts] [[H702]] [was] a row of masonry [[H2905]] with ovens [[H4018]] built [[H6213]] at the base of [[H8478]] the walls [[H2918]] on all sides. [[H5439]] 
24 And he said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “These [[H428]] are the kitchens [[H1004]] where [[H834]] those who minister [[H8334]] at the temple [[H1004]] will cook [[H1310]] the sacrifices [[H2077]] of the people.” [[H5971]]
