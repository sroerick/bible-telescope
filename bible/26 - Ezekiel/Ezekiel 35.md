1 Moreover, the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] turn [[H7760]] your face [[H6440]] toward [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Seir [[H8165]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against it, [[H5921]] 
3 and declare [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I am against you, [[H413]] O Mount [[H2022]] Seir. [[H8165]] I will stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against you [[H5921]] and make [[H5414]] you a desolate [[H8077]] waste. [[H4923]] 
4 I will turn your cities [[H5892]] into [[H7760]] ruins, [[H2723]] and you [[H859]] will become [[H1961]] a desolation. [[H8077]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 Because [[H3282]] you harbored [[H1961]] an ancient [[H5769]] hatred [[H342]] and delivered [[H5064]] the Israelites [[H1121]] over to [[H5921]] the sword [[H2719]] in the time [[H6256]] of their disaster, [[H343]] at the final stage [[H6256]] of their punishment, [[H5771]] 
6 therefore, [[H3651]] as surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] I will give you over [[H6213]] to bloodshed [[H1818]] and [it] [[H1818]] will pursue you. [[H7291]] Since [[H518]] you did not [[H3808]] hate [[H8130]] bloodshed, [[H1818]] it [[H1818]] will pursue you. [[H7291]] 
7 I will make [[H5414]] Mount [[H2022]] Seir [[H8165]] a desolate [[H8077]] waste [[H8077]] and will cut off [[H3772]] from it [[H4480]] those who come [[H7725]] and go. [[H5674]] 
8 I will fill [[H4390]] its mountains [[H2022]] with the slain; [[H2491]] those killed [[H2491]] by the sword [[H2719]] will fall [[H5307]] on your hills, [[H1389]] in your valleys, [[H1516]] and in all [[H3605]] your ravines. [[H650]] 
9 I will make [[H5414]] you a perpetual [[H5769]] desolation, [[H8077]] and your cities [[H5892]] will not [[H3808]] be inhabited. [[H3427]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
10 Because [[H3282]] you have said, [[H559]] “These two [[H8147]] nations [[H1471]] and [[H8147]] countries [[H776]] will be ours, [[H1961]] and we will possess them,” [[H3423]] even though the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] there, [[H8033]] 
11 therefore, [[H3651]] as surely I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] I will treat you [[H6213]] according to the anger [[H639]] and jealousy [[H7068]] you showed [[H6213]] in your hatred [[H8135]] against them,  and I will make Myself known [[H3045]] among them  when [[H834]] I judge you. [[H8199]] 
12 Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have heard [[H8085]] every [[H3605]] contemptuous word [[H5007]] you uttered [[H559]] against [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] when you said, [[H559]] “They are desolate; [[H8074]] they are given to us [[H5414]] to devour!” [[H402]] 
13 You boasted [[H1431]] against Me [[H5921]] with your mouth [[H6310]] and multiplied [[H6280]] your words [[H1697]] against Me. [[H5921]] I [[H589]] heard it Myself!’ [[H8085]] 
14 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘While the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] rejoices, [[H8055]] I will make [[H6213]] you  desolate. [[H8077]] 
15 As you rejoiced [[H8057]] when the inheritance [[H5159]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] became desolate, [[H8074]] so [[H3651]] will I do [[H6213]] to you:  you will become [[H1961]] a desolation, [[H8077]] O Mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] and so will all [[H3605]] of Edom. [[H123]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]]
