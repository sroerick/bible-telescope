[[H8034]] 
62 These [men] [[H428]] searched for [[H1245]] their family records, [[H3791]] but they could not [[H3808]] find them [[H4672]] and so were excluded [[H1351]] from [[H4480]] the priesthood {as unclean}. [[H3550]] 
63 The governor [[H8660]] ordered [[H559]] them not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] the most holy things [[H6944]] until [[H5704]] there was a priest [[H3548]] to consult the Urim [[H224]] and Thummim. [[H8550]]

69 According to their ability, [[H3581]] they gave [[H5414]] to the treasury [[H214]] for this work [[H4399]] 61,000 [[H8337]] darics [[H1871]] of gold, [[H2091]] 5,000 [[H2568]] minas [[H4488]] of silver, [[H3701]] and 100 [[H3967]] priestly [[H3548]] garments. [[H3801]] 
70 So the priests, [[H3548]] the Levites, [[H3881]] the singers, [[H7891]] the gatekeepers, [[H7778]] and the temple servants, [[H5411]] along with some [[H4480]] of the people, [[H5971]] settled [[H3427]] in their own towns; [[H5892]] and the rest [[H3605]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] settled [in their towns].
