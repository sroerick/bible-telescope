1 Later, the prophets [[H5013]] Haggai [[H2292]] and Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1247]] of Iddo [[H5714]] prophesied [[H5013]] to [[H5922]] the Jews [[H3062]] in Judah [[H3061]] and Jerusalem [[H3390]] in the name [[H8036]] of the God [[H426]] of Israel, [[H3479]] who was over them. [[H5922]] 
2 Then [[H116]] Zerubbabel [[H2217]] son [[H1247]] of Shealtiel [[H7598]] and Jeshua [[H3443]] son [[H1247]] of Jozadak [[H3136]] rose up [[H6966]] and began [[H8271]] to rebuild [[H1124]] the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] in Jerusalem. [[H3390]] And the prophets [[H5029]] of [[H1768]] God [[H426]] were with them, [[H5974]] helping them. [[H5583]] 
3 At that time [[H2166]] Tattenai [[H8674]] the governor [[H6347]] of the region west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates, [[H5103]] Shethar-bozenai, [[H8370]] and their associates [[H3675]] went [[H858]] to [[H5922]] the Jews and asked, [[H560]] “Who [[H4479]] authorized you [[H7761]] to rebuild [[H1124]] this [[H1836]] temple [[H1005]] and restore [[H3635]] this [[H1836]] structure?” [[H846]] 
4 They also [[H116]] asked, [[H560]] “What [[H4479]] are [[H581]] the names [[H8036]] of the men [[H1400]] who [[H1768]] are constructing [[H1124]] this [[H1836]] building?” [[H1147]] 
5 But the eye [[H5870]] of their God [[H426]] was [[H1934]] on [[H5922]] the elders [[H7868]] of the Jews, [[H3062]] so that they were not [[H3809]] stopped [[H989]] until [[H5705]] a report [[H2941]] was sent [[H1946]] to Darius [[H1868]] and [[H116]] written instructions [[H5407]] about [[H5922]] this matter [[H1836]] were returned. [[H8421]] 
6 This is the text [[H6573]] of the letter [[H104]] that [[H1768]] Tattenai [[H8674]] the governor [[H6347]] of the region west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates, [[H5103]] Shethar-bozenai, [[H8370]] and their associates, [[H3675]] the officials [[H671]] in the region, [[H5675]] sent [[H7972]] to [[H5922]] King [[H4430]] Darius. [[H1868]] 
7 The report [[H6600]] they sent [[H7972]] him [[H5922]] read as follows: [[H3790]] To King [[H4430]] Darius: [[H1868]] All [[H3606]] peace. [[H8001]] 
8 Let it be [[H1934]] known [[H3046]] to the king [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] we went [[H236]] into the province [[H4083]] of Judah, [[H3061]] to the house [[H1005]] of the great [[H7229]] God. [[H426]] [The people] [[H1932]] are rebuilding it [[H1124]] with large stones, [[H69]] and placing [[H7761]] timbers [[H636]] in the walls. [[H3797]] This [[H1791]] work [[H5673]] is being carried out [[H5648]] diligently [[H629]] and is prospering [[H6744]] in their hands. [[H3028]] 
9 So [[H116]] we questioned [[H7593]] the [[H479]] elders [[H7868]] and asked, [[H560]] “Who [[H4479]] authorized you [[H7761]] to rebuild [[H1124]] this [[H1836]] temple [[H1005]] and restore [[H3635]] this [[H1836]] structure?” [[H846]] 
10 We also [[H638]] asked for [[H7593]] their names, [[H8036]] so that [[H1768]] we could write down [[H3790]] the names [[H8036]] of their leaders [[H1400]] for your information. [[H3046]] 
11 And this [[H3660]] is the answer [[H6600]] they returned: [[H8421]] “We [[H586]] are [[H1994]] servants [[H5649]] of the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] and earth, [[H772]] and we are rebuilding [[H1124]] the temple [[H1005]] that [[H1768]] was [[H1934]] built [[H1124]] many [[H7690]] years [[H8140]] ago, [[H6928]] which a great [[H7229]] king [[H4430]] of Israel [[H3479]] built [[H1124]] and completed. [[H3635]] 
12 But [[H3861]] since [[H4481]] our fathers [[H2]] angered [[H7265]] the God [[H426]] of heaven, [[H8065]] He handed them [[H1994]] over to [[H3052]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] king [[H4430]] of Babylon, [[H895]] the Chaldean [[H3679]] who destroyed [[H5642]] this [[H1836]] temple [[H1005]] and carried away [[H1541]] the people [[H5972]] to Babylon. [[H895]] 
13 However, [[H1297]] in his first [[H2298]] year, [[H8140]] Cyrus [[H3567]] king [[H4430]] of [[H1768]] Babylon [[H895]] issued [[H7761]] a decree [[H2942]] to rebuild [[H1124]] this [[H1836]] house [[H1005]] of God. [[H426]] 
14 He also [[H638]] removed [[H5312]] from [[H4481]] the temple [[H1965]] of [[H1768]] Babylon [[H895]] the gold [[H1722]] and silver [[H3702]] articles [[H3984]] belonging to [[H1768]] the house [[H1005]] of God, [[H426]] which [[H1768]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] had taken [[H5312]] and carried [[H2987]] [there] [[H1965]] from [[H4481]] the temple [[H1965]] in Jerusalem. [[H3390]] King [[H4430]] Cyrus [[H3567]] gave [these articles] [[H3052]] to a man named [[H8036]] Sheshbazzar, [[H8340]] whom he appointed [[H7761]] governor [[H6347]] 
15 and instructed, [[H560]] ‘Take [[H5376]] these [[H412]] articles, [[H3984]] put [[H5182]] them [[H1994]] in the temple [[H1965]] in Jerusalem, [[H3390]] and let the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] be rebuilt [[H1124]] on [[H5922]] its original site.’ [[H870]] 
16 So [[H116]] this [[H1791]] Sheshbazzar [[H8340]] came [[H858]] and laid [[H3052]] the foundation [[H787]] of [[H1768]] the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] in Jerusalem, [[H3390]] and from [[H4481]] that time [[H116]] until [[H5705]] now [[H3705]] it has been under construction, [[H1124]] but is not [[H3809]] yet completed.” [[H8000]] 
17 Now, therefore, [[H3705]] if [[H2006]] it pleases [[H2869]] the king, [[H4430]] let a search be made [[H1240]] of the royal [[H1768]] archives [[H1005]] in Babylon [[H895]] to see if [[H2006]] King [[H4430]] Cyrus [[H3567]] did indeed [[H1768]] issue [[H7761]] a decree [[H2942]] to rebuild [[H1124]] the [[H1791]] house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] in Jerusalem. [[H3390]] Then let the king [[H4430]] send [[H7972]] us [[H5922]] his decision [[H7470]] in [[H5922]] this [matter]. [[H1836]]
