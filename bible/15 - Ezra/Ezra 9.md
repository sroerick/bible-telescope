# Ezra 9
[[Ezra 8|←]] • [[Ezra 10|→]]
1 After these [[H428]] things had been accomplished, [[H3615]] the leaders [[H8269]] approached [[H5066]] me [[H413]] and said: [[H559]] “The people [[H5971]] of Israel, [[H3478]] including the priests [[H3548]] and Levites, [[H3881]] have not [[H3808]] kept themselves separate [[H914]] from the surrounding [[H776]] peoples [[H5971]] whose abominations [[H8441]] are like those of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Jebusites, [[H2983]] Ammonites, [[H5984]] Moabites, [[H4125]] Egyptians, [[H4713]] and Amorites. [[H567]] 
2 Indeed, [[H3588]] the Israelites have taken [[H5375]] some of their daughters [as wives] [[H1323]] for themselves [[H1992]] and their sons, [[H1121]] so that the holy [[H6944]] seed [[H2233]] has been mixed [[H6148]] with the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]] And the leaders [[H8269]] and officials [[H5461]] have taken the lead [[H3027]] in this [[H2088]] unfaithfulness!” [[H4604]] 
3 When I heard [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] report, [[H1697]] I tore [[H7167]] my tunic [[H899]] and cloak, [[H4598]] pulled out [[H4803]] some hair [[H8181]] from my head [[H7218]] and beard, [[H2206]] and sat down [[H3427]] in horror. [[H8074]] 
4 Then everyone [[H3605]] who trembled [[H2730]] at the words [[H1697]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] gathered [[H622]] around me [[H413]] because of [[H5921]] the unfaithfulness [[H4604]] of the exiles, [[H1473]] while I [[H589]] sat there [[H3427]] in horror [[H8074]] until [[H5704]] the evening [[H6153]] offering. [[H4503]] 
5 At the evening [[H6153]] offering, [[H4503]] I got up [[H6965]] from my humiliation [[H8589]] with my tunic [[H899]] and cloak [[H4598]] torn, [[H7167]] and I fell [[H3766]] on [[H5921]] my knees, [[H1290]] spread out [[H6566]] my hands [[H3709]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] 
6 and said: [[H559]] “O my God, [[H430]] I am ashamed [[H954]] and embarrassed [[H3637]] to lift up [[H7311]] my face [[H6440]] to You, [[H413]] my God, [[H430]] because [[H3588]] our iniquities [[H5771]] are higher than [[H7235]] our heads, [[H7218]] and our guilt [[H819]] has reached [[H1431]] the heavens. [[H8064]] 
7 From the days [[H3117]] of our fathers [[H1]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] our guilt [[H819]] has been great. [[H1419]] Because of our iniquities, [[H5771]] we [[H587]] and our kings [[H4428]] [and] our priests [[H3548]] have been delivered [[H5414]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] and put to the sword [[H2719]] and captivity, [[H7628]] to pillage [[H961]] and humiliation, [[H1322]] as we are this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
8 But now, [[H6258]] for a brief [[H4592]] moment, [[H7281]] grace [[H8467]] has come [[H1961]] from [[H853]] the LORD [[H3069]] our God [[H430]] to preserve [[H7604]] for us  a remnant [[H6413]] and to give [[H5414]] us  a stake [[H3489]] in His holy [[H6944]] place. [[H4725]] Even in our bondage, [[H5659]] our God [[H430]] has given us [[H5414]] new life [[H4241]] and light [[H215]] to our eyes. [[H5869]] 
9 Though [[H3588]] we [[H587]] are slaves, [[H5650]] our God [[H430]] has not [[H3808]] forsaken us [[H5800]] in our bondage, [[H5659]] but He has extended [[H5186]] to us [[H5921]] grace [[H2617]] in the sight [[H6440]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Persia, [[H6539]] giving [[H5414]] us new life [[H4241]] to rebuild [[H7311]] the house [[H1004]] of our God [[H430]] and repair [[H5975]] its ruins, [[H2723]] and giving [[H5414]] us  a wall of protection [[H1447]] in Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
10 And now, [[H6258]] our God, [[H430]] what [[H4100]] can we say [[H559]] after [[H310]] this? [[H2063]] For [[H3588]] we have forsaken [[H5800]] the commandments [[H4687]] 
11 that [[H834]] You gave [[H6680]] through [[H3027]] Your servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] saying: [[H559]] ‘The land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] is [[H1931]] a land [[H776]] polluted [[H5079]] by the impurity [[H5079]] of its peoples [[H5971]] and the abominations [[H8441]] with which [[H834]] they have filled it [[H4390]] from end [[H6310]] to [[H413]] end. [[H6310]] 
12 Now, therefore, [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] give [[H5414]] your daughters {in marriage} [[H1323]] to their sons [[H1121]] or take [[H5375]] their daughters [[H1323]] for your sons. [[H1121]] Never [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] their peace [[H7965]] or prosperity, [[H2896]] so that [[H4616]] you may be strong [[H2388]] and may eat [[H398]] the good things [[H2898]] of the land, [[H776]] leaving it as an inheritance [[H3423]] to your sons [[H1121]] forever. [[H5704]] 
13 After [[H310]] all [[H3605]] that has come [[H935]] upon us [[H5921]] because of our evil [[H7451]] deeds [[H4639]] and our great [[H1419]] guilt [[H819]] (though [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] our God, [[H430]] have punished us [[H2820]] less [[H4295]] than our iniquities [deserve] [[H5771]] and have given [[H5414]] us  [such] a remnant [[H6413]] as this) [[H2063]] 
14 shall we again [[H7725]] break [[H6565]] Your commandments [[H4687]] and intermarry [[H2859]] with the peoples [[H5971]] who commit these [[H428]] abominations? [[H8441]] Would You not [[H3808]] become so angry [[H599]] with us  as to [[H5704]] wipe us out, [[H3615]] leaving no [[H369]] remnant [[H7611]] or survivor? [[H6413]] 
15 O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] You [[H859]] are righteous! [[H6662]] For [[H3588]] we remain [[H7604]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] as a remnant. [[H6413]] Here we [are] [[H2005]] before You [[H6440]] in our guilt, [[H819]] though [[H3588]] because [[H5921]] of it [[H2063]] no one [[H369]] can stand [[H5975]] before You.” [[H6440]]
