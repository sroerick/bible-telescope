1 Many years later, [[H310]] during the reign [[H4438]] of King [[H4428]] Artaxerxes [[H783]] of Persia, [[H6539]] Ezra [[H5830]] son [[H1121]] of Seraiah, [[H8304]] the son [[H1121]] of Azariah, [[H5838]] the son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] 
2 the son [[H1121]] of Shallum, [[H7967]] the son [[H1121]] of Zadok, [[H6659]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahitub, [[H285]] 
3 the son [[H1121]] of Amariah, [[H568]] the son [[H1121]] of Azariah, [[H5838]] the son [[H1121]] of Meraioth, [[H4812]] 
4 the son [[H1121]] of Zerahiah, [[H2228]] the son [[H1121]] of Uzzi, [[H5813]] the son [[H1121]] of Bukki, [[H1231]] 
5 the son [[H1121]] of Abishua, [[H50]] the son [[H1121]] of Phinehas, [[H6372]] the son [[H1121]] of Eleazar, [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the chief [[H7218]] priest— [[H3548]] 
6 this [[H1931]] Ezra [[H5830]] came up [[H5927]] from Babylon. [[H894]] He [was] [[H1931]] a scribe [[H5608]] skilled [[H4106]] in the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] which [[H834]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] had given. [[H5414]] The king [[H4428]] had granted [[H5414]] [Ezra]  all [[H3605]] his requests, [[H1246]] for the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] was upon him. [[H5921]] 
7 So in the seventh [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of King [[H4428]] Artaxerxes, [[H783]] he went up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with some of [[H4480]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] including priests, [[H3548]] Levites, [[H3881]] singers, [[H7891]] gatekeepers, [[H7778]] and temple servants. [[H5411]] 
8 Ezra arrived [[H935]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] in the fifth [[H2549]] month [[H2320]] of the seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] of the king. [[H4428]] 
9 He had begun [[H3246]] the journey [[H4609]] from Babylon [[H894]] on the first [[H259]] day of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] and he arrived [[H935]] in [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] on the first [[H259]] day of the fifth [[H2549]] month, [[H2320]] for the gracious [[H2896]] hand [[H3027]] of his God [[H430]] was on him. [[H5921]] 
10 For [[H3588]] Ezra [[H5830]] had set [[H3559]] his heart [[H3824]] to study [[H1875]] the law [[H8451]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] to practice it, [[H6213]] and to teach [[H3925]] its statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] in Israel. [[H3478]] 
11 This [[H2088]] is the text [[H6572]] of the letter [[H5406]] King [[H4428]] Artaxerxes [[H783]] had given [[H5414]] to Ezra [[H5830]] the priest [[H3548]] and scribe, [[H5608]] a man learned [[H5608]] in the commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2706]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] 
12 Artaxerxes, [[H783]] king [[H4430]] of kings. [[H4430]] To Ezra [[H5831]] the priest, [[H3549]] the scribe [[H5613]] of the Law [[H1882]] of [[H1768]] the God [[H426]] of heaven: [[H8065]] Greetings. [[H1585]] 
13 I [[H4481]] hereby [[H7761]] decree [[H2942]] that [[H1768]] any [[H3606]] volunteers [[H5069]] among the Israelites [[H5972]] in my kingdom, [[H4437]] including the priests [[H3549]] and Levites, [[H3879]] may go up [[H1946]] with you [[H5974]] to Jerusalem. [[H3390]] 
14 You are sent [[H7972]] by [[H4481]] the king [[H4430]] and his seven [[H7655]] counselors [[H3272]] to evaluate [[H1240]] Judah [[H3061]] and Jerusalem [[H3390]] according to the law [[H1882]] of your God, [[H426]] which [[H1768]] is in your hand. [[H3028]] 
15 Moreover, you are to take with you [[H2987]] the silver [[H3702]] and gold [[H1722]] that the king [[H4430]] and his counselors [[H3272]] have freely offered [[H5069]] to the God [[H426]] of Israel, [[H3479]] whose [[H1768]] dwelling [[H4907]] is in Jerusalem, [[H3390]] 
16 together with all [[H3606]] the silver [[H3702]] and gold [[H1722]] you may find [[H7912]] in all [[H3606]] the province [[H4083]] of Babylon, [[H895]] as well as [[H5974]] the freewill offerings [[H5069]] of the people [[H5972]] and priests [[H3549]] to the house [[H1005]] of their God [[H426]] in Jerusalem. [[H3390]] 
17 With this [[H1836]] money, [[H3702]] therefore, [[H1836]] you are to buy [[H7066]] as many bulls, [[H8450]] rams, [[H1798]] and lambs [[H563]] as needed, [[H629]] together with their grain offerings [[H4504]] and drink offerings, [[H5261]] and offer [[H7127]] them [[H1994]] on [[H5922]] the altar [[H4056]] at the house [[H1005]] of your God [[H426]] in Jerusalem. [[H3390]] 
18 You and your brothers [[H252]] may do [[H5648]] whatever [[H4101]] seems best [[H3191]] with the rest [[H7606]] of the silver [[H3702]] and gold, [[H1722]] according to the will [[H7470]] of your God. [[H426]] 
19 You must deliver [[H8000]] to [[H6925]] the God [[H426]] of Jerusalem [[H3390]] all the articles [[H3984]] given [[H3052]] to you  for the service [[H6402]] of the house [[H1005]] of your God. [[H426]] 
20 And if anything else [[H7606]] is needed [[H2818]] for the house [[H1005]] of your God [[H426]] that [[H1768]] you  may have occasion [[H5308]] to supply, [[H5415]] you may pay [for it] [[H5415]] from [[H4481]] the royal [[H4430]] treasury. [[H1596]] 
21 I, [[H576]] King [[H4430]] Artaxerxes, [[H783]] decree [[H2942]] to all [[H3606]] the treasurers [[H1490]] west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates: [[H5103]] Whatever [[H3606]] Ezra [[H5831]] the priest, [[H3549]] the scribe [[H5613]] of the Law [[H1882]] of [[H1768]] the God [[H426]] of heaven, [[H8065]] may require of you, [[H7593]] it must be provided [[H5648]] promptly, [[H629]] 
22 up to [[H5705]] a hundred [[H3969]] talents [[H3604]] of silver, [[H3702]] a hundred [[H3969]] cors [[H3734]] of wheat, [[H2591]] a hundred [[H3969]] baths [[H1325]] of wine, [[H2562]] a hundred [[H3969]] baths [[H1325]] of olive oil, [[H4887]] and salt [[H4416]] without [[H3809]] limit. [[H3792]] 
23 Whatever [[H3606]] is commanded [[H2941]] by [[H4481]] the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] must be done [[H5648]] diligently [[H149]] for the [His] house. [[H1005]] For [[H1768]] why [[H4101]] should wrath [[H7109]] fall [[H1934]] on [[H5922]] the realm [[H4437]] of the king [[H4430]] and his sons? [[H1123]] 
24 And  be advised [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] you have no [[H3809]] authority [[H7990]] to impose [[H7412]] tribute, [[H4061]] duty, [[H1093]] or toll [[H1983]] on [[H5922]] any [[H3606]] of the priests, [[H3549]] Levites, [[H3879]] singers, [[H2171]] doorkeepers, [[H8652]] temple servants, [[H5412]] or other servants [[H6399]] of this [[H1836]] house [[H1005]] of God. [[H426]] 
25 And you, [[H607]] Ezra, [[H5831]] according to the wisdom [[H2452]] of your God [[H426]] which you possess, [[H1768]] are to appoint [[H4483]] magistrates [[H8200]] and judges [[H1782]] to judge [[H1778]] all [[H3606]] the people [[H5972]] west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates— [[H5103]] all [[H3606]] who know [[H3046]] the laws [[H1882]] of your God. [[H426]] And [[H1768]] you are to teach [these laws] [[H3046]] to anyone who [[H1768]] does not [[H3809]] know them. [[H3046]] 
26 If anyone [[H3606]] does not [[H3809]] keep [[H5648]] the law [[H1882]] of [[H1768]] your God [[H426]] and the law [[H1882]] of [[H1768]] the king, [[H4430]] let a strict [[H629]] judgment [[H1780]] be [[H1934]] executed [[H5648]] against him, [[H4481]] whether [[H2006]] death, [[H4193]] banishment, [[H8332]] confiscation [[H6065]] of property, [[H5232]] or imprisonment. [[H613]] 
27 Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of our fathers, [[H1]] who [[H834]] has put [[H5414]] into the heart [[H3820]] of the king [[H4428]] to so honor [[H6286]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] 
28 and who has shown [[H5186]] me [[H5921]] favor [[H2617]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] his counselors, [[H3289]] and all [[H3605]] his [[H4428]] powerful [[H1368]] officials. [[H8269]] And because the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] [was] upon me, [[H5921]] I [[H589]] took courage [[H2388]] and gathered [[H6908]] the leaders [[H7218]] of Israel [[H3478]] to return [[H5927]] with me.
