# Ezra 6
[[Ezra 5|←]] • [[Ezra 7|→]]
1 Thus [[H116]] King [[H4430]] Darius [[H1868]] ordered [[H7761]] a search [[H1240]] of the archives [[H1005]] stored [[H5182]] in the treasury [[H1596]] of Babylon. [[H895]] 
2 And a scroll [[H4040]] was found [[H7912]] in the fortress [[H1001]] of Ecbatana, [[H307]] in the province [[H4083]] of Media, [[H4076]] with the following [[H3652]] written [[H3790]] on it: [[H1459]] Memorandum: [[H1799]] 
3 In the first [[H2298]] year [[H8140]] of King [[H4430]] Cyrus, [[H3567]] he [[H3567]] issued [[H7761]] a decree [concerning] [[H2942]] the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] in Jerusalem: [[H3390]] Let the house [[H1005]] be rebuilt [[H1124]] as a place [[H870]] for [[H1768]] offering [[H1684]] sacrifices, [[H1685]] and let its foundations [[H787]] be firmly laid. [[H5446]] It is to be sixty [[H8361]] cubits [[H521]] high [[H7314]] [and] sixty [[H8361]] cubits [[H521]] wide, [[H6613]] 
4 with three [[H8532]] layers [[H5073]] of [[H1768]] cut stones [[H69]] and one [[H2323]] of [[H1768]] timbers. [[H636]] The costs [[H5313]] are to be paid [[H3052]] from [[H4481]] the royal [[H4430]] treasury. [[H1005]] 
5 Furthermore, the gold [[H1722]] and silver [[H3702]] articles [[H3984]] of the house [[H1005]] of God, [[H426]] which [[H1768]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] took [[H5312]] from [[H4481]] the temple [[H1965]] in Jerusalem [[H3390]] and carried [[H2987]] to Babylon, [[H895]] must also [[H638]] be returned [[H8421]] to the temple [[H1965]] in Jerusalem [[H3390]] and deposited [[H5182]] in the house [[H1005]] of God. [[H426]] 
6 Therefore [Darius decreed]: [[H3705]] To Tattenai [[H8674]] governor [[H6347]] of the region west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates, [[H5103]] Shethar-bozenai, [[H8370]] and your associates [[H3675]] and officials [[H671]] in the region: [[H5675]] You must stay [[H1934]] away [[H7352]] from [[H4481]] that place! [[H8536]] 
7 Leave the work [[H5673]] on the [[H1791]] house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] alone. [[H7662]] Let the governor [[H6347]] and elders [[H7868]] of the Jews [[H3062]] rebuild [[H1124]] this [[H1791]] house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] on [[H5922]] its original site. [[H870]] 
8 I hereby [[H4481]] decree [[H2942]] what [[H3964]] you must do [[H5648]] for [[H5974]] these [[H479]] elders [[H7868]] of the Jews [[H3062]] who are rebuilding [[H1124]] this [[H1791]] house [[H1005]] of God: [[H426]] The cost [[H5313]] is to be [[H1934]] paid [[H3052]] in full [[H629]] to these [[H479]] men [[H1400]] from the royal [[H4430]] treasury [[H5232]] out of the taxes [[H4061]] of [the provinces] west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates, [[H5103]] so that [[H1768]] the work will not [[H3809]] be hindered. [[H989]] 
9 Whatever [[H4101]] is needed— [[H2818]] young [[H1123]] bulls, [[H8450]] rams, [[H1798]] and lambs [[H563]] for burnt offerings [[H5928]] to the God [[H426]] of heaven, [[H8065]] as well as wheat, [[H2591]] salt, [[H4416]] wine, [[H2562]] and oil, [[H4887]] as requested [[H3983]] by the priests [[H3549]] in Jerusalem— [[H3390]] must be [[H1934]] given [[H3052]] to them  day [[H3118]] by day [[H3118]] without [[H3809]] fail. [[H7960]] 
10 Then [[H1768]] they will be able [[H1934]] to offer sacrifices [[H7127]] of a sweet aroma [[H5208]] to the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] and to pray [[H6739]] for the lives [[H2417]] of the king [[H4430]] and his sons. [[H1123]] 
11 I also decree [[H7761]] that [[H1768]] if any [[H3606]] man [[H606]] interferes [[H8133]] with this [[H1836]] directive, [[H6600]] a beam [[H636]] is to be torn [[H5256]] from [[H4481]] his house [[H1005]] and raised up, [[H2211]] and he is to be impaled [[H4223]] on it. [[H5922]] And his own house [[H1005]] shall be made [[H5648]] a pile of rubble [[H5122]] for [[H5922]] this offense. [[H1836]] 
12 May God, [[H426]] who [[H1768]] has caused His name [[H8036]] to dwell [[H7932]] there, [[H8536]] overthrow [[H4049]] any [[H3606]] king [[H4430]] or people [[H5972]] who [[H1768]] lifts [[H7972]] a hand [[H3028]] to alter [this decree] [[H8133]] or to destroy [[H2255]] this [[H1791]] house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] in Jerusalem. [[H3390]] I, [[H576]] Darius, [[H1868]] have issued [[H7761]] the decree. [[H2942]] Let it be carried out [[H5648]] with diligence. [[H629]] 
13 In response, [[H116]] Tattenai [[H8674]] the governor [[H6347]] of the region west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates, [[H5103]] Shethar-bozenai, [[H8370]] and their associates [[H3675]] diligently [[H629]] carried out [[H5648]] what [[H1768]] King [[H4430]] Darius [[H1868]] had decreed. [[H7972]] 
14 So the Jewish [[H3062]] elders [[H7868]] built [[H1124]] and prospered [[H6744]] through the prophesying [[H5017]] of Haggai [[H2292]] the prophet [[H5029]] and Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1247]] of Iddo. [[H5714]] They finished [[H3635]] building [[H1124]] according to [[H4481]] the command [[H2941]] of the God [[H426]] of Israel [[H3479]] and the decrees [[H2942]] of Cyrus, [[H3567]] Darius, [[H1868]] and Artaxerxes, [[H783]] kings [[H4430]] of Persia. [[H6540]] 
15 And this [[H1836]] temple [[H1005]] was completed [[H3319]] on [[H5705]] the third [[H8532]] day [[H3118]] of the month [[H3393]] of Adar, [[H144]] in the sixth [[H8353]] year [[H8140]] of the reign [[H4437]] of King [[H4430]] Darius. [[H1868]] 
16 Then the people [[H1123]] of Israel— [[H3479]] the priests, [[H3549]] the Levites, [[H3879]] and the rest [[H7606]] of the exiles— [[H1123]] celebrated [[H5648]] the dedication [[H2597]] of the [[H1836]] house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] with joy. [[H2305]] 
17 For the [[H1836]] dedication [[H2597]] of the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] they offered [[H7127]] a hundred [[H3969]] bulls, [[H8450]] two hundred [[H3969]] rams, [[H1798]] four [[H703]] hundred [[H3969]] lambs, [[H563]] and a sin offering [[H2402]] for [[H5922]] all [[H3606]] Israel [[H3479]] of twelve [[H8648]] male goats, [[H6841]] one for each tribe [[H7625]] of Israel. [[H3479]] 
18 They also appointed [[H6966]] the priests [[H3549]] by their divisions [[H6392]] and the Levites [[H3879]] by their groups [[H4255]] to [[H5922]] the service [[H5673]] of God [[H426]] in Jerusalem, [[H3390]] according to what is written [[H3792]] in the book [[H5609]] of Moses. [[H4873]] 
19 On the fourteenth day [[H702]] of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] the exiles [[H1121]] kept [[H6213]] the Passover. [[H6453]] 
20 All [[H3605]] the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] had purified themselves [[H2891]] and were ceremonially clean. [[H2889]] And [the Levites] slaughtered [[H7819]] the Passover lamb [[H6453]] for all [[H3605]] the exiles, [[H1121]] for their priestly [[H3548]] brothers, [[H251]] and for themselves. [[H1992]] 
21 The Israelites [[H1121]] who had returned [[H7725]] from exile [[H1473]] ate it, [[H398]] together with all [[H3605]] who had separated themselves [[H914]] from the uncleanness [[H2932]] of the Gentiles [[H1471]] of the land, [[H776]] in order to seek [[H1875]] the LORD, [[H3069]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
22 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] they observed [[H6213]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Unleavened Bread [[H4682]] with joy, [[H8057]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had made them joyful [[H8055]] and turned [[H5437]] the heart [[H3820]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] toward them [[H5921]] to strengthen [[H2388]] their hands [[H3027]] in the work [[H4399]] on the house [[H1004]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel.
