# Isaiah 22
[[Isaiah 21|←]] • [[Isaiah 23|→]]
1 [This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning the Valley [[H1516]] of Vision: [[H2384]] What [[H4100]] ails you now, [[H645]] that [[H3588]] you have all [[H3605]] gone up [[H5927]] to the rooftops, [[H1406]] 
2 O city [[H5892]] of commotion, [[H8663]] O town [[H7151]] of revelry? [[H5947]] Your slain [[H2491]] did not [[H3808]] die [[H2491]] by the sword, [[H2719]] nor were they [[H3808]] killed [[H4191]] in battle. [[H4421]] 
3 All [[H3605]] your rulers [[H7101]] have fled [[H5074]] together, [[H3162]] captured [[H631]] without a bow. [[H7198]] All [[H3605]] your fugitives [[H4672]] were captured [[H631]] together, [[H3162]] having fled [[H1272]] to a distant place. [[H7350]] 
4 Therefore [[H5921]] I said, [[H559]] “Turn away [[H8159]] from me, [[H4480]] let me weep [[H1065]] bitterly! [[H4843]] Do not [[H408]] try [[H213]] to console me [[H5162]] over [[H5921]] the destruction [[H7701]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people.” [[H5971]] 
5 For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has [set] a day [[H3117]] of tumult [[H4103]] and trampling [[H4001]] and confusion [[H3998]] in the Valley [[H1516]] of Vision— [[H2384]] of breaking [[H6979]] down the walls [[H7023]] and crying [[H7771]] to [[H413]] the mountains. [[H2022]] 
6 Elam [[H5867]] takes up [[H5375]] a quiver, [[H827]] with chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen, [[H6571]] and Kir [[H7024]] uncovers [[H6168]] the shield. [[H4043]] 
7 Your choicest [[H4005]] valleys [[H6010]] are full of [[H4390]] chariots, [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H6571]] are posted [[H7896]] at the gates. [[H8179]] 
8 He has uncovered [[H1540]] the defenses [[H4539]] of Judah. [[H3063]] On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] you looked [[H5027]] to [[H413]] the weapons [[H5402]] in the House [[H1004]] of the Forest. [[H3293]] 
9 You saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] there were many [[H7235]] breaches [[H1233]] in the walls of the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] You collected [[H6908]] water [[H4325]] from the lower [[H8481]] pool. [[H1295]] 
10 You counted [[H5608]] the houses [[H1004]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and tore them down [[H5422]] to strengthen [[H1219]] the wall. [[H2346]] 
11 You built [[H6213]] a reservoir [[H4724]] between [[H996]] the walls [[H2346]] for the waters [[H4325]] of the ancient [[H3465]] pool, [[H1295]] but you did not [[H3808]] look [[H5027]] to [[H413]] the One who made it, [[H6213]] or consider [[H7200]] Him who planned [[H3335]] it long ago. [[H7350]] 
12 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts [[H6635]] called [[H7121]] for weeping [[H1065]] and wailing, [[H4553]] for shaven heads [[H7144]] and the wearing [[H2296]] of sackcloth. [[H8242]] 
13 But look, [[H2009]] there is joy [[H8342]] and gladness, [[H8057]] butchering [[H2026]] of cattle [[H1241]] and slaughtering [[H7819]] of sheep, [[H6629]] eating [[H398]] of meat [[H1320]] and drinking [[H8354]] of wine: [[H3196]] “Let us eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] for [[H3588]] tomorrow [[H4279]] we die!” [[H4191]] 
14 The LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has revealed [[H1540]] in my hearing: [[H241]] “Until  your dying day, [[H4191]] this [[H2088]] sin [[H5771]] of yours will never [[H518]] be atoned for,” [[H3722]] says [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
15 Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts: [[H6635]] “Go, [[H1980]] [say] [[H935]] to [[H413]] Shebna, [[H7644]] the [[H2088]] steward [[H5532]] in charge of [[H5921]] the palace: [[H1004]] 
16 What [[H4100]] are you doing here, [[H6311]] and who [[H4310]] authorized you  to carve out [[H2672]] a tomb [[H6913]] for yourself [[H6311]] here, [[H6311]] to chisel [[H2672]] your tomb [[H6913]] in the height [[H4791]] and cut [[H2710]] your resting place [[H4908]] in the rock? [[H5553]] 
17 Look, [[H2009]] O mighty man! [[H1397]] The LORD [[H3068]] is about to shake you violently. [[H2904]] He will take hold [[H5844]] of you, [[H5844]] 
18 roll you [[H6801]] into a ball, [[H1754]] and sling you into [[H413]] a wide [[H7342]] land. [[H776]] There [[H8033]] you will die, [[H4191]] and there [[H8033]] your glorious [[H3519]] chariots {will remain}— [[H4818]] a disgrace [[H7036]] to the house [[H1004]] of your master. [[H113]] 
19 I will depose [[H1920]] you from office, [[H4673]] and you will be ousted [[H2040]] from your position. [[H4612]] 
20 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will summon [[H7121]] My servant, [[H5650]] Eliakim [[H471]] son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah. [[H2518]] 
21 I will clothe [[H3847]] him with your robe [[H3801]] and tie your sash [[H73]] around him. [[H2388]] I will put [[H5414]] your authority [[H4475]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and he will be [[H1961]] a father [[H1]] to the dwellers [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and to the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
22 I will place [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] his shoulder [[H7926]] the key [[H4668]] of the house [[H1004]] of David. [[H1732]] What he opens, [[H6605]] no [[H369]] one can shut; [[H5462]] what he shuts, [[H5462]] no [[H369]] one can open. [[H6605]] 
23 I will drive him [[H8628]] like a peg [[H3489]] into a firm [[H539]] place, [[H4725]] and he will be [[H1961]] a throne [[H3678]] of glory [[H3519]] for the house [[H1004]] of his father. [[H1]] 
24 So they will hang [[H8518]] on [[H5921]] him the whole [[H3605]] burden [[H3519]] of his father’s [[H1]] house: [[H1004]] the descendants [[H6631]] and the offshoots— [[H6849]] all [[H3605]] the lesser [[H6996]] vessels, [[H3627]] from bowls [[H101]] to [[H5704]] every kind [[H3605]] of jar. [[H5035]] 
25 In that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the peg [[H3489]] driven [[H8628]] into a firm [[H539]] place [[H4725]] will give way; [[H4185]] it will be sheared off [[H1438]] and fall, [[H5307]] and the load [[H4853]] upon it [[H5921]] will be cut down.” [[H3772]] Indeed, [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken.
