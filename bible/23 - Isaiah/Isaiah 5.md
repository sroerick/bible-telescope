# Isaiah 5
[[Isaiah 4|←]] • [[Isaiah 6|→]]
1 I will sing [[H7891]] for my beloved, [[H3039]] a song [[H7892]] of [his] [[H1730]] vineyard: [[H3754]] My beloved [[H3039]] had [[H1961]] a vineyard [[H3754]] on a very fertile [[H1121]] hill. [[H7161]] 
2 He dug it up [[H5823]] and cleared the stones [[H5619]] and planted [[H5193]] the finest vines. [[H8321]] He built [[H1129]] a watchtower [[H4026]] in the middle [[H8432]] and [[H1571]] dug out [[H2672]] a winepress {as well}. [[H3342]] He waited for [the vineyard] [[H6960]] to yield [[H6213]] good grapes, [[H6025]] but the fruit it produced [[H6213]] was sour! [[H891]] 
3 And now, [[H6258]] O dwellers [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] I exhort [[H4994]] you to judge [[H8199]] between Me [[H996]] and My vineyard. [[H3754]] 
4 What [[H4100]] more [[H5750]] could have been done [[H6213]] for My vineyard [[H3754]] that I did not [[H3808]] already do [[H6213]] in it?  Why, [[H4069]] when I waited [[H6960]] for it to yield [[H6213]] good grapes, [[H6025]] did it bring forth [[H6213]] sour fruit? [[H891]] 
5 Now [[H6258]] I will tell you [[H3045]] what [[H834]] I [[H589]] am about to do [[H6213]] to My vineyard: [[H3754]] I will take away [[H5493]] its hedge, [[H4881]] and it will be [[H1961]] consumed; [[H1197]] I will tear down [[H6555]] its wall, [[H1447]] and it will be [[H1961]] trampled. [[H4823]] 
6 I will make [[H7896]] it a wasteland, [[H1326]] neither [[H3808]] pruned [[H2168]] nor [[H3808]] cultivated, [[H5737]] and thorns [[H7898]] and briers [[H8068]] will grow up. [[H5927]] I will command [[H6680]] the clouds [[H5645]] that rain [[H4306]] shall not fall [[H4305]] on it. [[H5921]] 
7 For [[H3588]] the vineyard [[H3754]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] are the plant [[H5194]] of His delight. [[H8191]] He looked [[H6960]] for justice [[H4941]] but saw [[H2009]] injustice; [[H4939]] for righteousness, [[H6666]] but heard [[H2009]] a cry of distress. [[H6818]] 
8 Woe [[H1945]] to those who add [[H5060]] house [[H1004]] to house [[H1004]] and join [[H7126]] field [[H7704]] to field [[H7704]] until [[H5704]] there is no [[H657]] room [[H4725]] and you dwell [[H3427]] alone [[H905]] in [[H7130]] the land. [[H776]] 
9 I heard [[H241]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts {declare}: [[H6635]] “Surely [[H518]] many [[H7227]] houses [[H1004]] will become [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8047]] great mansions [[H1419]] left unoccupied. [[H3427]] 
10 For [[H3588]] ten [[H6235]] acres [[H6776]] of vineyard [[H3754]] will yield [[H6213]] [but] a [[H259]] bath [of wine], [[H1324]] and a homer [[H2563]] of seed [[H2233]] [only] [[H6213]] an ephah [of grain].” [[H374]] 
11 Woe [[H1945]] to those who rise early [[H7925]] in the morning [[H1242]] in pursuit of [[H7291]] strong drink, [[H7941]] who linger [[H309]] into the evening, [[H5399]] to be inflamed [[H1814]] by wine. [[H3196]] 
12 At their feasts [[H4960]] are the lyre [[H3658]] [and] harp, [[H5035]] tambourines [[H8596]] and flutes [[H2485]] and wine. [[H3196]] They disregard [[H3808]] the actions [[H6467]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and fail [[H3808]] to see [[H7200]] the work [[H4639]] of His hands. [[H3027]] 
13 Therefore [[H3651]] My people [[H5971]] will go into exile [[H1540]] for their lack [[H1097]] of understanding; [[H1847]] their dignitaries [[H3519]] are starving, [[H7458]] and their masses [[H1995]] are parched [[H6704]] with thirst. [[H6772]] 
14 Therefore [[H3651]] Sheol [[H7585]] enlarges [[H7337]] its throat [[H5315]] and opens [[H6473]] wide its enormous [[H1097]] jaws, [[H6310]] and down go [[H3381]] [Zion’s] nobles [[H1926]] [and] masses, [[H1995]] her jubilant [[H7588]] and carousers! [[H5938]] 
15 So mankind [[H120]] will be brought low, [[H7817]] and each man [[H376]] humbled; [[H8213]] the arrogant [[H1364]] will lower [[H8213]] their eyes. [[H5869]] 
16 But the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will be exalted [[H1361]] by His justice, [[H4941]] and the holy [[H6918]] God [[H410]] will show Himself holy [[H6942]] in righteousness. [[H6666]] 
17 Lambs [[H3532]] will graze [[H7462]] as in their own pastures, [[H1699]] and strangers [[H1481]] will feed [[H398]] in the ruins [[H2723]] of the wealthy. [[H4220]] 
18 Woe [[H1945]] to those who draw [[H4900]] iniquity [[H5771]] with cords [[H2256]] of deceit [[H7723]] and pull sin along [[H2403]] with cart [[H5699]] ropes, [[H5688]] 
19 to those who say, [[H559]] “Let Him hurry [[H4116]] and hasten His work [[H4639]] so that [[H4616]] we may see it! [[H7200]] Let the plan [[H6098]] of the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel [[H3478]] come [[H935]] so that we may know it!” [[H3045]] 
20 Woe [[H1945]] to those who call [[H559]] evil [[H7451]] good [[H2896]] and good [[H2896]] evil, [[H7451]] who turn [[H7760]] darkness [[H2822]] to light [[H216]] and light [[H216]] to darkness, [[H2822]] who replace [[H7760]] bitter [[H4751]] with sweet [[H4966]] and sweet [[H4966]] with bitter. [[H4751]] 
21 Woe [[H1945]] to those who are wise [[H2450]] in their own eyes [[H5869]] and clever [[H995]] in [[H5048]] their own sight. [[H6440]] 
22 Woe [[H1945]] to those who are heroes [[H1368]] in drinking [[H8354]] wine, [[H3196]] and champions [[H582]] in mixing [[H4537]] beer, [[H7941]] 
23 who acquit [[H6663]] the guilty [[H7563]] for [[H6118]] a bribe, [[H7810]] and deprive [[H5493]] the innocent [[H6662]] of justice. [[H6666]] 
24 Therefore, [[H3651]] as a tongue [[H3956]] of fire [[H784]] consumes [[H398]] straw [[H7179]] and dry grass [[H2842]] shrivels [[H7503]] in the flame, [[H3852]] so their roots [[H8328]] will decay [[H1961]] and their blossoms [[H6525]] will blow away [[H5927]] like dust; [[H80]] for [[H3588]] they have rejected [[H3988]] the instruction [[H8451]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] and despised [[H5006]] the word [[H565]] of the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel. [[H3478]] 
25 Therefore [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] burns [[H2734]] against His people; [[H5971]] He has raised [[H5186]] His hand [[H3027]] against them [[H5921]] and struck them; [[H5221]] the mountains [[H2022]] quaked, [[H7264]] and their corpses [[H5038]] lay [[H1961]] like refuse [[H5478]] in [[H7130]] the streets. [[H2351]] Yet through all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] His anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] spent, [[H7725]] and His hand [[H3027]] is still [[H5750]] upraised. [[H5186]] 
26 He lifts [[H5375]] a banner [[H5251]] for the distant [[H7350]] nations [[H1471]] and whistles [[H8319]] for those  at the ends [[H7097]] of the earth. [[H776]] Behold— [[H2009]] how speedily [[H4120]] and swiftly [[H7031]] they come! [[H935]] 
27 None [[H369]] of them grows weary [[H5889]] or stumbles; [[H3782]] no [[H3808]] one slumbers [[H5123]] or sleeps. [[H3462]] No [[H3808]] belt [[H232]] is loose [[H6605]] and no [[H3808]] sandal [[H5275]] strap [[H8288]] is broken. [[H5423]] 
28 Their arrows [[H2671]] are sharpened, [[H8150]] and all [[H3605]] their bows [[H7198]] are strung. [[H1869]] The hooves [[H6541]] of their horses [[H5483]] are like flint; [[H6862]] their chariot wheels [[H1534]] [are] like a whirlwind. [[H5492]] 
29 Their roaring [[H7581]] is like that of a lion; [[H3833]] they roar [[H7580]] like young lions. [[H3715]] They growl [[H5098]] and seize [[H270]] their prey; [[H2964]] they carry it [[H6403]] away [[H369]] from deliverance. [[H5337]] 
30 In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they will roar [[H5098]] over it, [[H5921]] like the roaring [[H5100]] of the sea. [[H3220]] If one looks [[H5027]] over the land, [[H776]] he will see [[H2009]] darkness [[H2822]] and distress; [[H6862]] even the light [[H216]] will be obscured [[H2821]] by clouds. [[H6183]]
