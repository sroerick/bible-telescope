# Isaiah 12
[[Isaiah 11|←]] • [[Isaiah 13|→]]
1 In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] you will say: [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] I will praise You. [[H3034]] Although [[H3588]] You were angry with me, [[H599]] Your anger [[H639]] has turned away, [[H7725]] and You have comforted me. [[H5162]] 
2 Surely [[H2009]] God [[H410]] is my salvation; [[H3444]] I will trust [[H982]] and not [[H3808]] be afraid. [[H6342]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3050]] GOD [[H3068]] is my strength [[H5797]] and my song, [[H2176]] and He also has become [[H1961]] my salvation.” [[H3444]] 
3 With joy [[H8342]] you will draw [[H7579]] water [[H4325]] from the springs [[H4599]] of salvation, [[H3444]] 
4 and on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] you will say: [[H559]] “Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD; [[H3069]] proclaim [[H7121]] His name! [[H8034]] Make [[H3045]] His works {known} [[H5949]] among the peoples; [[H5971]] declare [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] His name [[H8034]] is exalted. [[H7682]] 
5 Sing [[H2167]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He has done [[H6213]] glorious things. [[H1348]] Let this [[H2063]] be known [[H3045]] in all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]] 
6 Cry out [[H6670]] and sing, [[H7442]] O citizen [[H3427]] of Zion, [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] among you [[H7130]] [is] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel.” [[H3478]]
