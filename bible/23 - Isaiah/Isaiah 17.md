# Isaiah 17
[[Isaiah 16|←]] • [[Isaiah 18|→]]
1 [This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning Damascus: [[H1834]] “Behold, [[H2009]] Damascus [[H1834]] is no longer [[H5493]] a city; [[H5892]] it has become [[H1961]] a heap [[H4596]] of ruins. [[H4654]] 
2 The cities [[H5892]] of Aroer [[H6177]] are forsaken; [[H5800]] they will be left [[H1961]] to the flocks, [[H5739]] which will lie down [[H7257]] with no one [[H369]] to fear. [[H2729]] 
3 The fortress [[H4013]] will disappear [[H7673]] from Ephraim, [[H669]] and the sovereignty [[H4467]] from Damascus. [[H1834]] The remnant [[H7605]] of Aram [[H758]] will be [[H1961]] like the splendor [[H3519]] of the Israelites,” [[H1121]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
4 “In [[H1961]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the splendor [[H3519]] of Jacob [[H3290]] will fade, [[H1809]] and the fat [[H4924]] of his body [[H1320]] will waste away, [[H7329]] 
5 as [[H1961]] the reaper [[H7105]] gathers [[H622]] the standing grain [[H7054]] and harvests [[H7114]] the ears [[H7641]] with his arm, [[H2220]] as one gleans [[H3950]] heads of grain [[H7641]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]] 
6 Yet gleanings [[H5955]] will remain, [[H7604]] like an olive tree [[H2132]] that has been beaten— [[H5363]] two [[H8147]] or three [[H7969]] berries [[H1620]] atop the tree, [[H7218]] four [[H702]] or five [[H2568]] on its fruitful [[H6509]] branches,” [[H5585]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
7 In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] men [[H120]] will look [[H8159]] to [[H5921]] their Maker [[H6213]] and turn their eyes [[H5869]] to [[H413]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel. [[H3478]] 
8 They will not [[H3808]] look [[H8159]] to [[H413]] the altars [[H4196]] they have made [[H4639]] with their hands [[H3027]] or to the Asherahs [[H842]] and incense altars [[H2553]] they have made [[H6213]] with their fingers. [[H676]] 
9 In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] their strong [[H4581]] cities [[H5892]] will be like [[H1961]] forsaken [[H5800]] thickets [[H2793]] and summits, [[H534]] abandoned [[H6440]] to the Israelites [[H1121]] and to utter [[H1961]] desolation. [[H8077]] 
10 For [[H3588]] you have forgotten [[H7911]] the God [[H430]] of your salvation, [[H3468]] and failed [[H3808]] to remember [[H2142]] the rock [[H6697]] of your strength. [[H4581]] Therefore, [[H5921]] though you cultivate [[H5193]] delightful [[H5282]] plots [[H5194]] and set out cuttings [[H2232]] from exotic [[H2114]] vines— [[H2156]] 
11 though on the day [[H3117]] you plant [[H5194]] you make them grow, [[H7735]] and on that morning [[H1242]] you help your seed [[H2233]] sprout— [[H6524]] yet the harvest [[H7105]] will vanish [[H5067]] on the day [[H3117]] of disease [[H2470]] and incurable [[H605]] pain. [[H3511]] 
12 Alas, [[H1945]] the tumult [[H1995]] of many [[H7227]] peoples— [[H5971]] they rage [[H1993]] like the roaring [[H1993]] seas; [[H3220]] the uproar [[H7588]] of the nations— [[H3816]] they rumble [[H7582]] like the crashing [[H7588]] of mighty [[H3524]] waters. [[H4325]] 
13 The nations [[H3816]] rage [[H7582]] like the rush [[H7588]] of many [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]] He rebukes [[H1605]] them,  and they flee [[H5127]] far away, [[H4801]] driven [[H7291]] before [[H6440]] the wind [[H7307]] like chaff [[H4671]] on the hills, [[H2022]] like tumbleweeds [[H1534]] before [[H6440]] a gale. [[H5492]] 
14 In the evening, [[H6153]] there is [[H2009]] sudden terror! [[H1091]] Before [[H2962]] morning, [[H1242]] they are no more! [[H369]] This [[H2088]] [is] the portion [[H2506]] of those who loot us [[H8154]] and the lot [[H1486]] of our plunderers. [[H962]]
