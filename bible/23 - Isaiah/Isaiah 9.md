# Isaiah 9
[[Isaiah 8|←]] • [[Isaiah 10|→]]
1 Nevertheless, [[H3588]] there will be no more [[H3808]] gloom [[H4155]] for those [[H834]] in distress. [[H4164]] In the past [[H7223]] He humbled [[H7043]] the land [[H776]] of Zebulun [[H2074]] and the land [[H776]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] but in the future [[H314]] He will honor [[H3513]] the Way [[H1870]] to the Sea, [[H3220]] beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] Galilee [[H1551]] of the Gentiles: [[H1471]] 
2 The people [[H5971]] walking [[H1980]] in darkness [[H2822]] have seen [[H7200]] a great [[H1419]] light; [[H216]] on [[H5921]] those living [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of the shadow of death, [[H6757]] a light [[H216]] has dawned. [[H5050]] 
3 You have enlarged [[H7235]] the nation [[H1471]] and increased [[H1431]] its joy. [[H8057]] The people rejoice [[H8055]] before You [[H6440]] as they rejoice [[H8057]] at harvest time [[H7105]] as [[H834]] [men] rejoice [[H1523]] in dividing [[H2505]] the plunder. [[H7998]] 
4 For [[H3588]] the yoke [[H5923]] of their burden, [[H5448]] the bar [across] [[H4294]] their shoulders, [[H7926]] and the rod [[H7626]] of their oppressor [[H5065]] You have shattered [[H2865]] as in the day [[H3117]] of Midian. [[H4080]] 
5 For [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] trampling [[H5431]] boot [[H5430]] of battle [[H7494]] and [every] garment [[H8071]] rolled [[H1556]] in blood [[H1818]] will be [[H1961]] burned [[H8316]] as fuel [[H3980]] for the fire. [[H784]] 
6 For [[H3588]] unto us  a child [[H3206]] is born, [[H3205]] unto us  a son [[H1121]] is given, [[H5414]] and the government [[H4951]] will be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] His shoulders. [[H7926]] And He will be called [[H7121]] Wonderful [[H6382]] Counselor, [[H3289]] Mighty [[H1368]] God, [[H410]] Everlasting Father, [[H5703]] Prince [[H8269]] of Peace. [[H7965]] 
7 Of the increase [[H4766]] of [His] government [[H4951]] and peace [[H7965]] [there will be] no [[H369]] end. [[H7093]] He will reign on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David [[H1732]] and over [[H5921]] his kingdom, [[H4467]] to establish [[H3559]] and sustain it [[H5582]] with justice [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6666]] from that time [[H6258]] and forevermore. [[H5704]] The zeal [[H7068]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will accomplish [[H6213]] this. [[H2063]] 
8 The Lord [[H136]] has sent [[H7971]] a message [[H1697]] against Jacob, [[H3290]] and it has fallen [[H5307]] upon Israel. [[H3478]] 
9 All [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] will know it— [[H3045]] Ephraim [[H669]] and the dwellers [[H3427]] of Samaria. [[H8111]] With pride [[H1346]] and arrogance [[H1433]] of heart [[H3824]] they will say: [[H559]] 
10 “The bricks [[H3843]] have fallen, [[H5307]] but we will rebuild [[H1129]] with finished stone; [[H1496]] the sycamores [[H8256]] have been felled, [[H1438]] but we will replace [[H2498]] them with cedars.” [[H730]] 
11 The LORD [[H3068]] has raised up [[H7682]] the foes [[H6862]] of Rezin [[H7526]] against him [[H5921]] and joined [[H5526]] his enemies {together}. [[H341]] 
12 Aram [[H758]] from the east [[H6924]] and Philistia [[H6430]] from the west [[H268]] have devoured [[H398]] Israel [[H3478]] with open [[H3605]] mouths. [[H6310]] Despite all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] His anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] turned away; [[H7725]] His hand [[H3027]] is still [[H5750]] upraised. [[H5186]] 
13 But the people [[H5971]] did not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] Him who struck them; [[H5221]] they did not [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
14 So the LORD [[H3068]] will cut off [[H3772]] Israel’s [[H3478]] head [[H7218]] and tail, [[H2180]] [both] palm branch [[H3712]] and reed [[H100]] in a single [[H259]] day. [[H3117]] 
15 The head [[H7218]] is the elder [[H2205]] and the honorable [[H5375]] man [[H1931]] and the tail [[H2180]] is the prophet [[H5030]] who teaches [[H3384]] lies. [[H8267]] 
16 For [[H1961]] those who guide [[H833]] this people [[H5971]] mislead them, [[H8582]] and those they mislead [[H833]] are swallowed up. [[H1104]] 
17 Therefore [[H5921]] the Lord [[H136]] takes no [[H3808]] pleasure [[H8055]] in [[H5921]] their young men; [[H970]] He has no [[H3808]] compassion [[H7355]] on their fatherless [[H3490]] and [[H853]] widows. [[H490]] For [[H3588]] every one of them [[H3605]] is godless [[H2611]] and wicked, [[H7489]] and every [[H3605]] mouth [[H6310]] speaks [[H1696]] folly. [[H5039]] Despite all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] His anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] turned away; [[H7725]] His hand [[H3027]] is still [[H5750]] upraised. [[H5186]] 
18 For [[H3588]] wickedness [[H7564]] burns [[H1197]] like a fire [[H784]] that consumes [[H398]] the thorns [[H7898]] and briers [[H8068]] and kindles [[H3341]] the forest [[H3293]] thickets [[H5442]] which roll upward [[H55]] in columns [[H1348]] of smoke. [[H6227]] 
19 By the wrath [[H5678]] of the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts [[H6635]] the land [[H776]] is scorched, [[H6272]] and the people [[H5971]] are [[H1961]] fuel [[H3980]] for the fire. [[H784]] Not [[H3808]] one [[H376]] will spare [[H2550]] his brother. [[H251]] 
20 They carve out [[H1504]] what is on [[H5921]] the right, [[H3225]] but they are still hungry; [[H7456]] they have eaten [[H398]] what is on [[H5921]] the left, [[H8040]] but they are still not [[H3808]] satisfied. [[H7646]] Each one [[H376]] devours [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of his own arm. [[H2220]] 
21 Manasseh [[H4519]] [devours] Ephraim, [[H669]] and Ephraim [[H669]] Manasseh; [[H4519]] together [[H3162]] they turn against [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]] Despite all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] His anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] turned away; [[H7725]] His hand [[H3027]] is still [[H5750]] upraised. [[H5186]]
