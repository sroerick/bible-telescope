# Isaiah 35
[[Isaiah 34|←]] • [[Isaiah 36|→]]
1 The wilderness [[H4057]] and the land [[H6723]] will be glad; [[H7797]] the desert [[H6160]] will rejoice [[H1523]] and blossom [[H6524]] like a rose. [[H2261]] 
2 It will bloom abundantly [[H6524]] and even [[H637]] rejoice [[H1523]] with joy [[H1525]] and singing. [[H7442]] The glory [[H3519]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] will be given [[H5414]] it,  the splendor [[H1926]] of Carmel [[H3760]] and Sharon. [[H8289]] They [[H1992]] will see [[H7200]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the splendor [[H1926]] of our God. [[H430]] 
3 Strengthen [[H2388]] the limp [[H7504]] hands [[H3027]] and steady [[H553]] the feeble [[H3782]] knees! [[H1290]] 
4 Say [[H559]] to those with anxious [[H4116]] hearts: [[H3820]] “Be strong, [[H2388]] do not [[H408]] fear! [[H3372]] Behold, [[H2009]] your God [[H430]] will come [[H935]] with vengeance. [[H5359]] With divine [[H430]] retribution [[H1576]] He [[H1931]] will come [[H935]] to save you.” [[H3467]] 
5 Then [[H227]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the blind [[H5787]] will be opened [[H6491]] and the ears [[H241]] of the deaf [[H2795]] unstopped. [[H6605]] 
6 Then [[H227]] the lame [[H6455]] will leap [[H1801]] like a deer [[H354]] and the mute [[H483]] tongue [[H3956]] will shout for joy. [[H7442]] For [[H3588]] waters [[H4325]] will gush forth [[H1234]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and streams [[H5158]] in the desert. [[H6160]] 
7 The parched ground [[H8273]] will become [[H1961]] a pool, [[H98]] the thirsty land [[H6774]] springs [[H4002]] of water. [[H4325]] In the haunt [[H5116]] where jackals [[H8577]] once lay, [[H7258]] there will be grass [[H2682]] [and] reeds [[H7070]] and papyrus. [[H1573]] 
8 And there [[H8033]] will be [[H1961]] a highway [[H4547]] called [[H7121]] the Way [[H1870]] of Holiness. [[H6944]] The unclean [[H2931]] will not [[H3808]] travel it, [[H5674]] only [[H1931]] those who walk [[H1980]] in that Way— [[H1870]] and fools [[H191]] will not [[H3808]] stray onto it. [[H8582]] 
9 No [[H3808]] lion [[H738]] will be [[H1961]] there, [[H8033]] and no [[H1077]] vicious [[H6530]] beast [[H2416]] will go up on it. [[H5927]] Such will not [[H3808]] be found [[H4672]] there, [[H8033]] but the redeemed [[H1350]] will walk upon it, [[H1980]] 
10 and the ransomed [[H6299]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will return. [[H7725]] They will enter [[H935]] Zion [[H6726]] with singing, [[H7440]] crowned [[H5921]] with everlasting [[H5769]] joy. [[H8057]] Joy [[H8057]] and gladness [[H8342]] will overtake them, [[H5381]] and sorrow [[H3015]] and sighing [[H585]] will flee. [[H5127]]
