# Isaiah 48
[[Isaiah 47|←]] • [[Isaiah 49|→]]
1 Listen [[H8085]] to this, [[H2063]] O house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] you who are called [[H7121]] by the name [[H8034]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who have descended [[H3318]] from the line [[H4325]] of Judah, [[H3063]] who swear [[H7650]] by the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and invoke [[H2142]] the God [[H430]] of Israel— [[H3478]] but not [[H3808]] in truth [[H571]] [or] [[H3808]] righteousness— [[H6666]] 
2 who indeed [[H3588]] call yourselves [[H7121]] after the Holy [[H6944]] City [[H5892]] and lean [[H5564]] on [[H5921]] the God [[H430]] of Israel— [[H3478]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] [is] His name. [[H8034]] 
3 I foretold [[H5046]] the former things [[H7223]] long ago; [[H227]] they came [[H3318]] out of My mouth; [[H6310]] I proclaimed them. [[H8085]] Suddenly [[H6597]] I acted, [[H6213]] and they came to pass. [[H935]] 
4 For I knew [[H1847]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are stubborn; [[H7186]] your neck [[H6203]] is iron [[H1270]] and your forehead [[H4696]] [is] bronze. [[H5154]] 
5 Therefore I declared it [[H5046]] to you  long ago; [[H227]] I announced it [[H8085]] before [[H2962]] it came to pass, [[H935]] so you could not [[H6435]] claim, [[H559]] ‘My idol [[H6091]] has done this; [[H6213]] my carved image [[H6459]] and molten god [[H5262]] has ordained it.’ [[H6680]] 
6 You have heard [these things]; [[H8085]] look at [[H2372]] them all. [[H3605]] Will you [[H859]] not [[H3808]] acknowledge it? [[H5046]] From now on [[H6258]] I will tell you of [[H8085]] new things, [[H2319]] hidden things [[H5341]] unknown to you. [[H3808]] 
7 They are created [[H1254]] now, [[H6258]] and not [[H3808]] long ago; [[H227]] you have not [[H3808]] heard of them [[H8085]] before [[H6440]] today, [[H3117]] so you cannot [[H6435]] claim, [[H559]] ‘I already [[H2009]] knew them!’ [[H3045]] 
8 You have never [[H3808]] heard; [[H8085]] you have never [[H3808]] understood; [[H3045]] for a long time [[H227]] your ears [[H241]] have not [[H3808]] been open. [[H6605]] For [[H3588]] I knew [[H3045]] how deceitful you are; [[H898]] you have been called [[H7121]] a rebel [[H6586]] from birth. [[H990]] 
9 For the sake [[H4616]] of My name [[H8034]] I will delay [[H748]] My wrath; [[H639]] for the sake of My praise [[H8416]] I will restrain it, [[H2413]] so that you will not [[H1115]] be cut off. [[H3772]] 
10 See, [[H2009]] I have refined you, [[H6884]] but not [[H3808]] as silver; [[H3701]] I have tested [[H977]] you in the furnace [[H3564]] of affliction. [[H6040]] 
11 For My own sake, [[H4616]] My very own sake, [[H4616]] I will act; [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] how [[H349]] can I let Myself be defamed? [[H2490]] I will not [[H3808]] yield [[H5414]] My glory [[H3519]] to another. [[H312]] 
12 “Listen [[H8085]] to Me, [[H413]] O Jacob, [[H3290]] and Israel, [[H3478]] whom I have called: [[H7121]] I [[H589]] am He; [[H1931]] I [[H589]] am the first, [[H7223]] and I am [[H589]] the last. [[H314]] 
13 Surely [[H637]] My own hand [[H3027]] founded [[H3245]] the earth, [[H776]] and My right hand [[H3225]] spread out [[H2946]] the heavens; [[H8064]] when I [[H589]] summon them, [[H7121]] they stand up [[H5975]] together. [[H3162]] 
14 Come together, [[H6908]] all of you, [[H3605]] and listen: [[H8085]] Which [of the idols] [[H4310]] has foretold [[H5046]] these things? [[H428]] The LORD’s [[H3069]] chosen ally [[H157]] will carry out [[H6213]] His desire [[H2656]] against Babylon, [[H894]] and His arm [[H2220]] will be against the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] 
15 I, [[H589]] even I, [[H589]] have spoken; [[H1696]] yes, [[H637]] I have called him. [[H7121]] I have brought him, [[H935]] and he will succeed [[H6743]] in his mission. [[H1870]] 
16 Come near [[H7126]] to Me [[H413]] and listen [[H8085]] to this: [[H2063]] “From the beginning [[H7218]] I have not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] in secret; [[H5643]] from the time [[H6256]] it took place, [[H1961]] I [[H589]] was there.” [[H8033]] And now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] has sent me, [[H7971]] accompanied by His Spirit. [[H7307]] 
17 Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] your Redeemer, [[H1350]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel: [[H3478]] “I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who teaches [[H3925]] you for your benefit, [[H3276]] who directs [[H1869]] you in the way [[H1870]] you should go. [[H1980]] 
18 If only [[H3863]] you had paid attention [[H7181]] to My commandments, [[H4687]] your peace [[H7965]] would have been [[H1961]] like a river, [[H5104]] and your righteousness [[H6666]] like waves [[H1530]] of the sea. [[H3220]] 
19 Your descendants [[H2233]] would have been [[H1961]] as countless as the sand, [[H2344]] and your offspring [[H6631]] as its grains; [[H4579]] their name [[H8034]] would never [[H3808]] be cut off [[H3772]] or eliminated [[H8045]] from My presence.” [[H6440]] 
20 Leave [[H3318]] Babylon, [[H894]] flee [[H1272]] from the Chaldeans! [[H3778]] Declare it [[H5046]] with a shout [[H6963]] of joy, [[H7440]] proclaim [[H8085]] it, [[H2063]] let it go out [[H3318]] to [[H5704]] the ends [[H7097]] of the earth, [[H776]] saying, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has redeemed [[H1350]] His servant [[H5650]] Jacob!” [[H3290]] 
21 They did not [[H3808]] thirst [[H6770]] when He led [[H1980]] them through the deserts; [[H2723]] He made water [[H4325]] flow [[H5140]] for them  from the rock; [[H6697]] He split [[H1234]] the rock, [[H6697]] and water [[H4325]] gushed out. [[H2100]] 
22 “There is no [[H369]] peace,” [[H7965]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “for the wicked.” [[H7563]]
