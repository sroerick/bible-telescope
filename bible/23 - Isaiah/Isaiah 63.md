# Isaiah 63
[[Isaiah 62|←]] • [[Isaiah 64|→]]
1 Who [[H4310]] is this [[H2088]] coming [[H935]] from Edom, [[H123]] from Bozrah [[H1224]] with crimson-stained [[H2556]] garments? [[H899]] Who is this [[H2088]] robed [[H3830]] in splendor, [[H1921]] marching [[H6808]] in the greatness [[H7230]] of His strength? [[H3581]] “It is I [[H589]] who speak [[H1696]] in righteousness, [[H6666]] mighty [[H7227]] to save.” [[H3467]] 
2 Why [[H4069]] are Your clothes [[H3830]] red, [[H122]] and Your garments [[H899]] like one who treads [[H1869]] the winepress? [[H1660]] 
3 “I have trodden [[H1869]] the winepress alone, [[H6333]] and no [[H369]] one [[H376]] from the nations [[H5971]] was with Me. [[H854]] I trampled [[H1869]] them in My anger [[H639]] and trod them underfoot [[H7429]] in My fury; [[H2534]] their blood [[H5332]] spattered [[H5137]] My garments, [[H899]] and all [[H3605]] My clothes [[H4403]] were stained. [[H1351]] 
4 For [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of vengeance [[H5359]] was in My heart, [[H3820]] and the year [[H8141]] of My redemption [[H1350]] had come. [[H935]] 
5 I looked, [[H5027]] but there was no one [[H369]] to help; [[H5826]] I was appalled [[H8074]] that no [[H369]] one assisted; [[H5564]] so My arm [[H2220]] brought Me salvation, [[H3467]] and My own wrath [[H2534]] upheld Me. [[H5564]] 
6 I trampled [[H947]] nations [[H5971]] in My anger; [[H639]] in My wrath [[H2534]] I made them drunk [[H7937]] and poured out [[H3381]] their blood [[H5332]] on the ground.” [[H776]] 
7 I will make known [[H2142]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] loving devotion [[H2617]] and [His] [[H3068]] praiseworthy acts, [[H8416]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] has done for us— [[H1580]] even the many [[H7227]] good things [[H2898]] He has done for the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] according to His compassion [[H7356]] and the abundance [[H7230]] of His loving devotion. [[H2617]] 
8 For He said, [[H559]] “They [[H1992]] are surely [[H389]] My people, [[H5971]] sons [[H1121]] who will not [[H3808]] be disloyal”; [[H8266]] and so He became [[H1961]] their [[H1992]] Savior. [[H3467]] 
9 In all [[H3605]] their distress, [[H6869]] He too was afflicted, [[H6862]] and the Angel [[H4397]] of His Presence [[H6440]] saved them. [[H3467]] In His love [[H160]] and compassion [[H2551]] He [[H1931]] redeemed them; [[H1350]] He lifted them up [[H5190]] and carried them [[H5375]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of old. [[H5769]] 
10 But they [[H1992]] rebelled [[H4784]] and grieved [[H6087]] His Holy [[H6944]] Spirit. [[H7307]] So He turned [[H2015]] [and became]  their enemy [[H341]] [and] He Himself [[H1931]] fought [[H3898]] against them.  
11 Then His people [[H5971]] remembered [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of old, [[H5769]] the days of Moses. [[H4872]] Where [[H346]] is He who brought them [[H5927]] through the sea [[H3220]] with [[H854]] the shepherds [[H7462]] of His flock? [[H6629]] Where [[H346]] is the One who set [[H7760]] His Holy [[H6944]] Spirit [[H7307]] among [[H7130]] them, [[H853]] 
12 who sent [[H1980]] His glorious [[H8597]] arm [[H2220]] [to lead them] by the right hand [[H3225]] of Moses, [[H4872]] who divided [[H1234]] the waters [[H4325]] before them [[H6440]] to gain [[H6213]] for Himself  everlasting [[H5769]] renown, [[H8034]] 
13 who led [[H1980]] them through the depths [[H8415]] like a horse [[H5483]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] so that they did not [[H3808]] stumble? [[H3782]] 
14 Like cattle [[H929]] going down [[H3381]] to the valley, [[H1237]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] gave them rest. [[H5117]] You led [[H5090]] Your people [[H5971]] this way [[H3651]] to make [[H6213]] for Yourself  a glorious [[H8597]] name. [[H8034]] 
15 Look down [[H5027]] from heaven [[H8064]] and see, [[H7200]] from Your holy [[H6944]] and glorious [[H8597]] habitation. [[H2073]] Where [[H346]] are Your zeal [[H7068]] and might? [[H1369]] Your yearning [[H1995]] and compassion [[H7356]] for me [[H413]] are restrained. [[H662]] 
16 Yet [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are our Father, [[H1]] though [[H3588]] Abraham [[H85]] does not [[H3808]] know us [[H3045]] and Israel [[H3478]] does not [[H3808]] acknowledge us. [[H5234]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] are our Father; [[H1]] our Redeemer [[H1350]] from of old [[H5769]] is Your name. [[H8034]] 
17 Why, [[H4100]] O LORD, [[H3068]] do You make us stray [[H8582]] from Your ways [[H1870]] [and] harden [[H7188]] our hearts [[H3820]] from fearing You? [[H3374]] Return, [[H7725]] for the sake [[H4616]] of Your servants, [[H5650]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Your heritage. [[H5159]] 
18 For a short while [[H4705]] Your people [[H5971]] possessed [[H3423]] Your holy place, [[H6944]] but our enemies [[H6862]] have trampled [[H947]] Your sanctuary. [[H4720]] 
19 We have become [[H1961]] like those You never [[H5769]] ruled, [[H4910]] like those not [[H3808]] called [[H7121]] by Your name. [[H8034]]
