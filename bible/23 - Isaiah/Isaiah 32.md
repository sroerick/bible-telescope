# Isaiah 32
[[Isaiah 31|←]] • [[Isaiah 33|→]]
1 Behold, [[H2005]] a king [[H4428]] will reign [[H4427]] in righteousness, [[H6664]] and princes [[H8269]] will rule [[H8323]] with justice. [[H4941]] 
2 Each [[H376]] will be [[H1961]] like a shelter [[H4224]] from the wind, [[H7307]] a refuge [[H5643]] from the storm, [[H2230]] like streams [[H6388]] of water [[H4325]] in a dry land, [[H6724]] and the shadow [[H6738]] of a great [[H3515]] rock [[H5553]] in an arid [[H5889]] land. [[H776]] 
3 Then the eyes [[H5869]] of those who see [[H7200]] will no longer [[H3808]] be closed, [[H8159]] and the ears [[H241]] of those who hear [[H8085]] will listen. [[H7181]] 
4 The mind [[H3824]] of the rash [[H4116]] will know [[H995]] and understand, [[H3045]] and the stammering [[H5926]] tongue [[H3956]] will speak [[H1696]] clearly [[H6703]] and fluently. [[H4116]] 
5 No [[H3808]] longer {will} [[H5750]] a fool [[H5036]] be called [[H7121]] noble, [[H5081]] nor [[H3808]] a scoundrel [[H3596]] said [[H559]] to be important. [[H7771]] 
6 For [[H3588]] a fool [[H5036]] speaks [[H1696]] foolishness; [[H5039]] his mind [[H3820]] plots [[H6213]] iniquity. [[H205]] He practices [[H6213]] ungodliness [[H2612]] and speaks [[H1696]] falsely [[H8442]] about [[H413]] the LORD; [[H3069]] he leaves the hungry [[H5315]] empty [[H7324]] and deprives the thirsty [[H6771]] of [[H2637]] drink. [[H4945]] 
7 The weapons [[H3627]] of the scoundrel [[H3596]] are destructive; [[H7451]] he [[H1931]] hatches [[H3289]] plots [[H2154]] to destroy [[H2254]] the poor [[H6035]] with lies, [[H561]] even when the plea [[H1696]] of the needy [[H34]] is just. [[H4941]] 
8 But a noble man [[H5081]] makes [[H3289]] honorable plans; [[H5081]] he [[H1931]] stands up [[H6965]] for [[H5921]] worthy causes. [[H5081]] 
9 Stand up, [[H6965]] you complacent [[H7600]] women; [[H802]] listen to me. [[H8085]] Give ear [[H238]] to my word, [[H565]] you overconfident [[H982]] daughters. [[H1323]] 
10 In a little more than [[H3117]] a year [[H8141]] you will tremble, [[H7264]] O secure ones. [[H982]] For [[H3588]] the grape harvest [[H1210]] will fail [[H3615]] and the fruit harvest [[H625]] will not [[H1097]] arrive. [[H935]] 
11 Shudder, [[H2729]] you ladies of leisure; [[H7600]] tremble, [[H7264]] you daughters of complacency. [[H982]] Strip [[H6584]] yourselves bare [[H6209]] and put [[H2296]] sackcloth around [[H5921]] your waists. [[H2504]] 
12 Beat [[H5594]] your breasts [[H7699]] for [[H5921]] the pleasant [[H2531]] fields, [[H7704]] for the fruitful [[H6509]] vines, [[H1612]] 
13 and for [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of my people, [[H5971]] overgrown [[H5927]] with thorns [[H6975]] and briers— [[H8068]] even [[H3588]] for [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of merriment [[H4885]] in this city [[H7151]] of revelry. [[H5947]] 
14 For [[H3588]] the palace [[H759]] will be forsaken, [[H5203]] the busy [[H1995]] city [[H5892]] abandoned. [[H5800]] The hill [[H6076]] and the watchtower [[H975]] will become [[H1961]] caves [[H4631]] forever— [[H5704]] the delight [[H4885]] of wild donkeys [[H6501]] and a pasture [[H4829]] for flocks— [[H5739]] 
15 until [[H5704]] the Spirit [[H7307]] is poured out [[H6168]] upon us [[H5921]] from on high. [[H4791]] Then the desert [[H4057]] will be [[H1961]] an orchard, [[H3759]] and the orchard [[H3759]] will seem [[H2803]] like a forest. [[H3293]] 
16 Then justice [[H4941]] will inhabit [[H7931]] the wilderness, [[H4057]] and righteousness [[H6666]] will dwell [[H3427]] in the fertile field. [[H3759]] 
17 The work [[H4639]] of righteousness [[H6666]] will be [[H1961]] peace; [[H7965]] the service [[H5656]] of righteousness [[H6666]] will be quiet [[H8252]] confidence [[H983]] forever. [[H5704]] 
18 Then my people [[H5971]] will dwell [[H3427]] in a peaceful [[H7965]] place, [[H5116]] in safe [[H4009]] and secure [[H7600]] places of rest. [[H4496]] 
19 But hail [[H1258]] will level [[H3381]] the forest, [[H3293]] and the city [[H5892]] will sink [[H8213]] to the depths. [[H8218]] 
20 Blessed [[H835]] [are] those who sow [[H2232]] beside [[H5921]] abundant [[H3605]] waters, [[H4325]] who let the ox [[H7794]] and donkey [[H2543]] range freely. [[H7971]]
