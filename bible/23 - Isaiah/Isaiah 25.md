# Isaiah 25
[[Isaiah 24|←]] • [[Isaiah 26|→]]
1 O LORD, [[H3068]] You [[H859]] are my God. [[H430]] I will exalt You; [[H7426]] I will praise [[H3034]] Your name. [[H8034]] For [[H3588]] You have worked [[H6213]] wonders— [[H6382]] plans [[H6098]] formed long ago [[H7350]] in perfect faithfulness. [[H530]] 
2 Indeed, [[H3588]] You have turned [[H7760]] the city [[H5892]] into a heap of rubble, [[H1530]] a fortified [[H1219]] town [[H7151]] into ruins; [[H4654]] the fortress [[H759]] of strangers [[H2114]] [is] a city [no more]; [[H5892]] it will never [[H5769]] be rebuilt. [[H1129]] 
3 Therefore, [[H5921]] a strong [[H5794]] people [[H5971]] will honor You. [[H3513]] The cities [[H7151]] of ruthless [[H6184]] nations [[H1471]] will revere You. [[H3372]] 
4 For [[H3588]] You have been [[H1961]] a refuge [[H4581]] for the poor, [[H1800]] a stronghold [[H4581]] for the needy [[H34]] in distress, [[H6862]] a refuge [[H4268]] from the storm, [[H2230]] a shade [[H6738]] from the heat. [[H2721]] For [[H3588]] the breath [[H7307]] of the ruthless [[H6184]] is like rain [[H2230]] against a wall, [[H7023]] 
5 like heat [[H2721]] in a dry land. [[H6724]] You subdue [[H3665]] the uproar [[H7588]] of foreigners. [[H2114]] As the shade [[H6738]] of a cloud [[H5645]] cools the heat of the day, [[H2721]] so the song [[H2158]] of the ruthless [[H6184]] is silenced. [[H6030]] 
6 On this [[H2088]] mountain [[H2022]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will prepare [[H6213]] a banquet [[H4960]] for all [[H3605]] the peoples, [[H5971]] a feast [[H4960]] of aged wine, [[H8105]] of choice meat, [[H8081]] of finely [[H2212]] aged wine. [[H8105]] 
7 On this [[H2088]] mountain [[H2022]] He will swallow up [[H1104]] the shroud [[H3874]] that enfolds [[H3875]] all [[H3605]] the peoples, [[H5971]] the sheet [[H4541]] that covers [[H5259]] all [[H3605]] the nations; [[H1471]] 
8 He will swallow up [[H1104]] death forever. [[H4194]] The Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] will wipe away [[H4229]] the tears [[H1832]] from [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] face [[H6440]] and remove [[H5493]] the disgrace [[H2781]] of His people [[H5971]] from [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] earth. [[H776]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken. [[H1696]] 
9 And in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] it will be said, [[H559]] “Surely [[H2009]] this [[H2088]] is our God; [[H430]] we have waited for Him, [[H6960]] and He has saved us. [[H3467]] This [[H2088]] is the LORD [[H3069]] for whom we have waited. [[H6960]] Let us rejoice [[H1523]] and be glad [[H8055]] in His salvation.” [[H3444]] 
10 For [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will rest [[H5117]] on this [[H2088]] mountain. [[H2022]] But Moab [[H4124]] will be trampled [[H1758]] in his place [[H8478]] as straw [[H4963]] is trodden [[H1758]] into the dung pile. [[H4087]] 
11 He will spread out [[H6566]] his hands [[H3027]] within it, [[H7130]] as [[H834]] a swimmer [[H7811]] spreads [his hands] [[H6566]] to swim. [[H7811]] His pride [[H1346]] will be brought low, [[H8213]] despite [[H5973]] the cleverness [[H698]] of his hands. [[H3027]] 
12 The high-walled [[H4869]] fortress [[H4013]] will be brought down, [[H7817]] cast [[H5060]] to the ground, [[H776]] into [[H5704]] the dust. [[H6083]]
