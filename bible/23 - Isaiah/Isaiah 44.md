# Isaiah 44
[[Isaiah 43|←]] • [[Isaiah 45|→]]
1 But now [[H6258]] listen, [[H8085]] O Jacob [[H3290]] My servant, [[H5650]] Israel, [[H3478]] whom I have chosen. [[H977]] 
2 This [[H3541]] is the word [[H559]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] your Maker, [[H6213]] who formed you [[H3335]] from the womb [[H990]] [and] will help you: [[H5826]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] O Jacob [[H3290]] My servant, [[H5650]] Jeshurun, [[H3484]] whom I have chosen. [[H977]] 
3 For [[H3588]] I will pour [[H3332]] water [[H4325]] on [[H5921]] the thirsty land, [[H6771]] and currents [[H5140]] on [[H5921]] the dry ground; [[H3004]] I will pour out [[H3332]] My Spirit [[H7307]] on [[H5921]] your descendants, [[H2233]] and My blessing [[H1293]] on [[H5921]] your offspring. [[H6631]] 
4 They will sprout [[H6779]] among [[H996]] the grass [[H2682]] like poplars [[H6155]] by [[H5921]] flowing [[H2988]] streams. [[H4325]] 
5 One [[H2088]] will say, [[H559]] ‘I [belong] [[H589]] to the LORD,’ [[H3068]] another [[H2088]] will call [[H7121]] himself by the name [[H8034]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and still another [[H2088]] will write [[H3789]] on his hand, [[H3027]] ‘The LORD’s,’ [[H3068]] and will take [[H3655]] the name [[H8034]] of Israel.” [[H3478]] 
6 Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the King [[H4428]] and Redeemer [[H1350]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts: [[H6635]] “I [[H589]] am the first [[H7223]] and I am [[H589]] the last, [[H314]] and there is no [[H369]] God [[H430]] but Me. [[H1107]] 
7 Who then [is] [[H4310]] like Me? [[H3644]] Let him say so! [[H7121]] Let him declare [[H5046]] [his] case [[H6186]] before Me,  since I established [[H7760]] an ancient [[H5769]] people. [[H5971]] Let him foretell [[H5046]] the things to come, [[H857]] and what [[H834]] is to take place. [[H935]] 
8 Do not [[H408]] tremble [[H6342]] [or] [[H408]] fear. [[H7297]] Have I not [[H3808]] told you [[H8085]] and declared it [[H5046]] long ago? [[H227]] You [[H859]] are My witnesses! [[H5707]] Is there [[H3426]] any God [[H433]] but Me? [[H1107]] There is no [[H369]] other Rock; [[H6697]] I know [[H3045]] not one.” [[H1077]] 
9 All [[H3605]] makers [[H3335]] of idols [[H6459]] are nothing, [[H8414]] and the things they treasure [[H2530]] are worthless. [[H3276]] Their witnesses [[H5707]] fail to [[H1077]] see [[H7200]] or know anything, [[H3045]] so [[H4616]] they are put to shame. [[H954]] 
10 Who [[H4310]] fashions [[H3335]] a god [[H410]] or casts [[H5258]] an idol [[H6459]] which profits him [[H3276]] nothing? [[H1115]] 
11 Behold, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] his companions [[H2270]] will be put to shame, [[H954]] for the craftsmen [[H2796]] themselves [[H1992]] are only human. [[H120]] Let them all [[H3605]] assemble [[H6908]] and take their stand; [[H5975]] they will all [[H3162]] be brought to terror [[H6342]] and shame. [[H954]] 
12 The blacksmith [[H2796]] takes a tool [[H4621]] and labors [[H6466]] over the coals; [[H6352]] he fashions [an idol] [[H3335]] with hammers [[H4717]] and forges [it] [[H6466]] with his strong [[H3581]] arms. [[H2220]] Yet [[H1571]] he grows hungry [[H7456]] and his strength [[H3581]] fails; [[H369]] he fails [[H3808]] to drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] and grows faint. [[H3286]] 
13 The woodworker [[H2790]] extends [[H5186]] a measuring line; [[H6957]] he marks it out [[H8388]] with a stylus; [[H8279]] he shapes [[H6213]] it with chisels [[H4741]] and outlines [[H8388]] it with a compass. [[H4230]] He fashions it [[H6213]] in the likeness [[H8403]] of man, [[H376]] like man [[H120]] in all his glory, [[H8597]] that it may dwell [[H3427]] in a shrine. [[H1004]] 
14 He cuts down [[H3772]] cedars [[H730]] or retrieves [[H3947]] a cypress [[H8645]] or oak. [[H437]] He lets it grow strong [[H553]] among the trees [[H6086]] of the forest. [[H3293]] He plants [[H5193]] a laurel, [[H766]] and the rain [[H1653]] makes it grow. [[H1431]] 
15 It serves [[H1961]] as fuel [[H1197]] for man. [[H120]] He takes [[H3947]] some of it [[H1992]] to warm himself, [[H2552]] and [[H637]] he kindles a fire [[H5400]] and bakes [[H644]] [his] bread; [[H3899]] he even [[H637]] fashions it [[H6466]] into a god [[H410]] and worships it; [[H7812]] he makes [[H6213]] an idol [[H6459]] and bows down [[H5456]] to it.  
16 He burns [[H8313]] half [[H2677]] of it in [[H1119]] the fire, [[H784]] and he roasts [[H6740]] meat [[H1320]] on [[H5921]] that half. [[H2677]] He eats [[H398]] the roast [[H6748]] and is satisfied. [[H7646]] Indeed, [[H637]] he warms [[H2552]] himself and says, [[H559]] “Ah! [[H1889]] I am warm; [[H2552]] I see [[H7200]] the fire.” [[H217]] 
17 From the rest [[H7611]] he makes [[H6213]] a god, [[H410]] his graven image. [[H6459]] He bows down to it [[H5456]] and worships; [[H7812]] he prays [[H6419]] to it [[H413]] and says, [[H559]] “Save me, [[H5337]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are my god.” [[H410]] 
18 They cannot [[H3808]] comprehend [[H3045]] [or] [[H3808]] understand, [[H995]] for [[H3588]] He has shut [[H2902]] their eyes [[H5869]] so they cannot see, [[H7200]] and [closed] their minds [[H3826]] so they cannot understand. [[H7919]] 
19 And no one [[H3808]] considers [[H7725]] in [[H413]] his heart, [[H3820]] no [[H3808]] one has the knowledge [[H1847]] or insight [[H8394]] to say, [[H559]] “I burned [[H8313]] half [[H2677]] of it in [[H1119]] the fire, [[H784]] and I [[H637]] baked [[H644]] bread [[H3899]] on [[H5921]] its coals, [[H1513]] I roasted [[H6740]] meat [[H1320]] and I ate. [[H398]] Shall I make [[H6213]] something detestable [[H8441]] with the rest of it? [[H3499]] Shall I bow down [[H5456]] to a block [[H944]] of wood? [[H6086]] 
20 He feeds on [[H7462]] ashes. [[H665]] His deluded [[H2048]] heart [[H3820]] has led him astray, [[H5186]] and he cannot [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] himself [[H5315]] [or] [[H3808]] say, [[H559]] “Is not [[H3808]] this thing in my right hand [[H3225]] a lie?” [[H8267]] 
21 Remember [[H2142]] these things, [[H428]] O Jacob, [[H3290]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are My servant, [[H5650]] O Israel. [[H3478]] I have made you; [[H3335]] you [[H859]] are My servant; [[H5650]] O Israel, [[H3478]] [I] will never [[H3808]] forget [you]. [[H5382]] 
22 I have blotted out [[H4229]] your transgressions [[H6588]] like a cloud, [[H5645]] and your sins [[H2403]] like a mist. [[H6051]] Return [[H7725]] to Me, [[H413]] for [[H3588]] I have redeemed you. [[H1350]] 
23 Sing for joy, [[H7442]] O heavens, [[H8064]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] has done this; [[H6213]] shout aloud, [[H7321]] O depths [[H8482]] of the earth. [[H776]] Break out [[H6476]] into singing, [[H7440]] O mountains, [[H2022]] you forests [[H3293]] and all your [[H3605]] trees. [[H6086]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] has redeemed [[H1350]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and revealed His glory [[H6286]] in Israel. [[H3478]] 
24 Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] your Redeemer [[H1350]] who formed you [[H3335]] from the womb: [[H990]] “I [[H595]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] who has made [[H6213]] all things, [[H3605]] who alone stretched out [[H5186]] the heavens, [[H8064]] who by Myself [[H854]] spread out [[H7554]] the earth, [[H776]] 
25 who foils [[H6565]] the signs [[H226]] of false prophets [[H907]] and makes fools of [[H1984]] diviners, [[H7080]] who confounds [[H7725]] the wise [[H2450]] and turns their knowledge [[H1847]] into nonsense, [[H5528]] 
26 who confirms [[H6965]] the message [[H1697]] of His servant [[H5650]] and fulfills [[H7999]] the counsel [[H6098]] of His messengers, [[H4397]] who says [[H559]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] ‘She will be inhabited,’ [[H3427]] and of the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] ‘They will be rebuilt, [[H1129]] and I will restore [[H6965]] their ruins,’ [[H2723]] 
27 who says [[H559]] to the depths of the sea, [[H6683]] ‘Be dry, [[H2717]] and I will dry up [[H3001]] your currents,’ [[H5104]] 
28 who says [[H559]] of Cyrus, [[H3566]] ‘My shepherd [[H7473]] will fulfill [[H7999]] all [[H3605]] that I desire,’ [[H2656]] who says [[H559]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] ‘She will be rebuilt,’ [[H1129]] and of the temple, [[H1964]] ‘Let its foundation be laid.’” [[H3245]]
