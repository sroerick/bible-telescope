# Isaiah 39
[[Isaiah 38|←]] • [[Isaiah 40|→]]
1 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Merodach-baladan [[H4757]] son [[H1121]] of Baladan [[H1081]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] and a gift [[H4503]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] for he had heard [[H8085]] about [[H3588]] [Hezekiah’s] illness [[H2470]] and recovery. [[H2388]] 
2 And Hezekiah [[H2396]] welcomed [[H8055]] [the envoys] [[H5921]] and showed them [[H7200]] what was in his treasure [[H5238]] house— [[H1004]] the silver, [[H3701]] the gold, [[H2091]] the spices, [[H1314]] and the precious [[H2896]] oil, [[H8081]] as well as his entire [[H3605]] armory— [[H1004]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was found [[H4672]] in his storehouses. [[H214]] There was [[H1961]] nothing [[H3808]] in his palace [[H1004]] or in all [[H3605]] his dominion [[H4474]] that [[H834]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] did not [[H3808]] show them. [[H7200]] 
3 Then the prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] and asked, [[H559]] “From where [[H370]] did those [men] [[H428]] come, [[H935]] and what [[H4100]] did they say [[H559]] to you?” [[H413]] “They came [[H935]] to me [[H413]] from [[H413]] a distant [[H7350]] land,” [[H776]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] replied, [[H559]] “from Babylon.” [[H894]] 
4 “What [[H4100]] have they seen [[H7200]] in your palace?” [[H1004]] Isaiah asked. [[H559]] “They have seen [[H7200]] everything [[H3605]] in my palace,” [[H1004]] answered [[H559]] Hezekiah. [[H2396]] “There is nothing [[H3808]] among my treasures [[H214]] that [[H834]] I did not [[H3808]] show them.” [[H7200]] 
5 Then Isaiah [[H3470]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] “Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts: [[H6635]] 
6 The time [[H3117]] will surely [[H2009]] come [[H935]] when everything [[H3605]] in your palace [[H1004]] and all that [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] have stored up [[H686]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] will be carried off [[H5375]] to Babylon. [[H894]] Nothing [[H3808]] will be left, [[H3498]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 And some of your descendants, [[H1121]] your [[H4480]] own flesh and blood, [[H3205]] will be taken away [[H3947]] to be [[H1961]] eunuchs [[H5631]] in the palace [[H1964]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon.” [[H894]] 
8 But Hezekiah [[H2396]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] “The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] you have spoken [[H1696]] is good.” [[H2896]] For he thought, [[H559]] “At least [[H3588]] there will be [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] and security [[H571]] in my lifetime.” [[H3117]]
