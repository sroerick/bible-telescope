# Isaiah 47
[[Isaiah 46|←]] • [[Isaiah 48|→]]
1 Go down [[H3381]] and sit [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the dust, [[H6083]] O Virgin [[H1330]] Daughter [[H1323]] of Babylon. [[H894]] Sit [[H3427]] on the ground [[H776]] without [[H369]] a throne, [[H3678]] O Daughter [[H1323]] of Chaldea! [[H3778]] For [[H3588]] you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] be called [[H7121]] tender [[H7390]] and delicate. [[H6028]] 
2 Take [[H3947]] millstones [[H7347]] and grind [[H2912]] flour; [[H7058]] remove [[H1540]] your veil, [[H6777]] strip off [[H2834]] your skirt, [[H7640]] bare [[H1540]] your thigh, [[H7785]] wade through [[H5674]] the streams. [[H5104]] 
3 Your nakedness [[H6172]] will be uncovered [[H1540]] and [[H1571]] your shame [[H2781]] will be exposed. [[H7200]] I will take [[H3947]] vengeance; [[H5359]] I will spare [[H6293]] no [[H3808]] one. [[H120]] 
4 Our Redeemer— [[H1350]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is His name— [[H8034]] [is] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
5 Sit [[H3427]] in silence [[H1748]] and go [[H935]] into darkness, [[H2822]] O Daughter [[H1323]] of Chaldea. [[H3778]] For [[H3588]] you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] be called [[H7121]] the queen [[H1404]] of kingdoms. [[H4467]] 
6 I was angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] My people; [[H5971]] I profaned [[H2490]] My heritage, [[H5159]] and I placed [[H5414]] them under your control. [[H3027]] You showed [[H7760]] them no [[H3808]] mercy; [[H7356]] even upon [[H5921]] the elderly [[H2205]] you laid a most heavy yoke. [[H5923]] 
7 You said, [[H559]] ‘I will be [[H1961]] queen [[H1404]] forever.’ [[H5769]] You did not [[H3808]] take [[H7760]] these [[H428]] things to [[H5921]] heart [[H3820]] or consider [[H2142]] their outcome. [[H319]] 
8 So now [[H6258]] hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] O lover of luxury, [[H5719]] who sits securely, [[H3427]] who says [[H559]] to herself, [[H3824]] ‘I [am], [[H589]] and there is none [[H657]] besides me. [[H5750]] I will never [[H3808]] be a widow [[H490]] or know [[H3045]] the loss of children.’ [[H7908]] 
9 These [[H428]] two [things] [[H8147]] will overtake you [[H935]] in a moment, [[H7281]] in a single [[H259]] day: [[H3117]] loss of children, [[H7908]] and widowhood. [[H489]] They will come [[H935]] upon you [[H5921]] in full measure, [[H8537]] in spite of your many [[H7230]] sorceries [[H3785]] and the potency [[H6109]] of your spells. [[H2267]] 
10 You were secure [[H982]] in your wickedness; [[H7451]] you said, [[H559]] ‘No [[H369]] one sees me.’ [[H7200]] Your wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge [[H1847]] led you astray; [[H7725]] you told [[H559]] yourself, [[H3820]] ‘I [am], [[H589]] and there is none [[H657]] besides me.’ [[H5750]] 
11 But disaster [[H7451]] will come [[H935]] upon you; [[H5921]] you will not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] how to charm it away. [[H7837]] A calamity [[H1943]] will befall [[H5307]] you [[H5921]] that you will be unable [[H3808]] to ward off. [[H3722]] Devastation [[H7722]] will happen [[H935]] to you [[H5921]] suddenly [[H6597]] and unexpectedly. [[H3808]] 
12 So take your stand [[H5975]] with your spells [[H2267]] and with your many [[H7230]] sorceries, [[H3785]] with which [[H834]] you have wearied yourself [[H3021]] from your youth. [[H5271]] Perhaps [[H194]] you will [[H3201]] succeed; [[H3276]] perhaps [[H194]] you will inspire terror! [[H6206]] 
13 You are wearied [[H3811]] from your many [[H7230]] counsels. [[H6098]] So let them stand [[H5975]] and save you— [[H3467]] the astrologers [[H1895]] who observe [[H2374]] the stars, [[H3556]] who monthly [[H2320]] predict [[H3045]] your fate. [[H834]] 
14 Surely [[H2009]] they are [[H1961]] like stubble; [[H7179]] the fire [[H784]] will burn them up. [[H8313]] They cannot [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] themselves [[H5315]] from the power [[H3027]] of the flame. [[H3852]] There will be no [[H369]] coals [[H1513]] to warm them [[H2552]] or fire [[H217]] to sit [[H3427]] beside. [[H5048]] 
15 This is what [[H3651]] they are [[H1961]] to you—  those with whom [[H834]] you have labored [[H3021]] and traded [[H5503]] from youth— [[H5271]] each one [[H376]] strays [[H8582]] in his own direction; [[H5676]] not one of them [[H369]] can save you. [[H3467]]
