# Isaiah 38
[[Isaiah 37|←]] • [[Isaiah 39|→]]
1 In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] became mortally [[H4191]] ill. [[H2470]] The prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] came [[H935]] to him [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Put your house [[H1004]] in order, [[H6680]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are about to die; [[H4191]] you will not [[H3808]] recover. [[H2421]] 
2 Then Hezekiah [[H2396]] turned [[H5437]] his face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] the wall [[H7023]] and prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] 
3 saying, [[H559]] “Please, [[H577]] O LORD, [[H3068]] remember [[H2142]] how [[H834]] I have walked [[H1980]] before You [[H6440]] faithfully [[H571]] and with wholehearted [[H3820]] devotion; [[H8003]] I have done [[H6213]] [what is] good [[H2896]] in Your sight.” [[H5869]] And Hezekiah [[H2396]] wept [[H1058]] bitterly. [[H1419]] 
4 And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] saying, [[H559]] 
5 “Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3069]] the God [[H430]] of your father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] says: [[H559]] I have heard [[H8085]] your prayer; [[H8605]] I have seen [[H7200]] your tears; [[H1832]] behold, [[H2005]] I will add [[H3254]] fifteen [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] to [[H5921]] your life. [[H3117]] 
6 And I will deliver you [[H5337]] and this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] from the hand [[H3709]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria; [[H804]] I will defend [[H1598]] this [[H2063]] city. [[H5892]] 
7 This [[H2088]] will be a sign [[H226]] to you  from [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] He [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] what [[H1697]] He has promised: [[H1696]] 
8 I will make the sun’s [[H8121]] shadow [[H6738]] that [[H834]] falls [[H3381]] on the stairway [[H4609]] of Ahaz [[H271]] go [[H7725]] ten [[H6235]] steps [[H4609]] backward.” [[H322]] So [the shadow cast by] the sun [[H8121]] went back [[H7725]] the ten [[H6235]] steps [[H4609]] it had descended. [[H3381]] 
9 [This is] a writing [[H4385]] by Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] after his illness [[H2470]] and recovery: [[H2421]] 
10 “I [[H589]] said that [[H559]] in the prime [[H1824]] of my life [[H3117]] I must go [[H1980]] to the gates [[H8179]] of Sheol; [[H7585]] I will be deprived [[H6485]] of the remainder [[H3499]] of my years. [[H8141]] 
11 I said that [[H559]] I will never [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] the LORD, [[H3050]] [even] the LORD, [[H3050]] in the land [[H776]] of the living; [[H2416]] I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] look on [[H5027]] mankind [[H120]] with [[H5973]] those who dwell [[H3427]] in this world. [[H2309]] 
12 My dwelling [[H1755]] has been picked up [[H5265]] and removed [[H1540]] from me [[H4480]] like a shepherd’s [[H7473]] tent. [[H168]] I have rolled up [[H7088]] my life [[H2416]] like a weaver; [[H707]] He cuts me off [[H1214]] from the loom. [[H1803]] From day [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] night [[H3915]] You make an end of me. [[H7999]] 
13 I composed myself [[H7737]] until [[H5704]] the morning. [[H1242]] Like a lion [[H738]] He breaks [[H7665]] all [[H3605]] my bones; [[H6106]] from day [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] night [[H3915]] You make an end of me. [[H7999]] 
14 I chirp [[H6850]] like a swallow [[H5483]] or crane; [[H5693]] I moan [[H1897]] like a dove. [[H3123]] My eyes [[H5869]] grow weak [[H1809]] [as I look] upward. [[H4791]] O Lord, [[H136]] I am oppressed; [[H6234]] be my security. [[H6148]] 
15 What [[H4100]] can I say? [[H1696]] He has spoken to me, [[H559]] and He [[H1931]] Himself has done this. [[H6213]] I will walk slowly [[H1718]] all [[H3605]] my years [[H8141]] because of [[H5921]] the anguish [[H4751]] of my soul. [[H5315]] 
16 O Lord, [[H136]] by [such things] [[H5921]] men live, [[H2421]] and in all [[H3605]] [of them]  my spirit [[H7307]] [finds] life. [[H2416]] You have restored me to health [[H2492]] and let me live. [[H2421]] 
17 Surely, [[H2009]] for my welfare [[H7965]] I had such great anguish; [[H4751]] but Your [[H859]] love [[H2836]] has delivered me [[H5315]] from the pit [[H7845]] of oblivion, [[H1097]] for [[H3588]] You have cast [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] my sins [[H2399]] behind [[H310]] Your back. [[H1460]] 
18 For [[H3588]] Sheol [[H7585]] cannot [[H3808]] thank You; [[H3034]] death [[H4194]] cannot praise You. [[H1984]] Those who go down [[H3381]] to the Pit [[H953]] cannot [[H3808]] hope [[H7663]] for [[H413]] Your faithfulness. [[H571]] 
19 The living, [[H2416]] only the living, [[H2416]] can thank You, [[H3034]] as I do today; [[H3644]] fathers [[H1]] will tell [[H3045]] their children [[H1121]] about [[H413]] Your faithfulness. [[H571]] 
20 The LORD [[H3068]] will save me; [[H3467]] we will play songs [[H5059]] on stringed instruments [[H5058]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of our lives [[H2416]] in [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
21 Now Isaiah [[H3470]] had said, [[H559]] “Prepare [[H5375]] a lump [[H1690]] of pressed figs [[H8384]] and apply [[H4799]] it to [[H5921]] the boil, [[H7822]] and he will recover.” [[H2421]] 
22 And Hezekiah [[H2396]] had asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] will be the sign [[H226]] that [[H3588]] I will go up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD?” [[H3068]]
