# Isaiah 64
[[Isaiah 63|←]] • [[Isaiah 65|→]]
1 If only  You would rend [[H7167]] the heavens [[H8064]] and come down, [[H3381]] so that mountains [[H2022]] would quake [[H2151]] at Your presence, [[H6440]] 
2 as fire [[H784]] kindles [[H6919]] the brushwood [[H2003]] [and] [[H784]] causes the water [[H4325]] to boil, [[H1158]] to make Your name [[H8034]] known [[H3045]] to Your enemies, [[H6862]] so that nations [[H1471]] will tremble [[H7264]] at Your presence! [[H6440]] 
3 When You did [[H6213]] awesome works [[H3372]] that we did not [[H3808]] expect, [[H6960]] You came down, [[H3381]] and the mountains [[H2022]] trembled [[H2151]] at Your presence. [[H6440]] 
4 From ancient times [[H5769]] no [[H3808]] one has heard, [[H8085]] no [[H3808]] ear has perceived, [[H238]] no [[H3808]] eye [[H5869]] has seen [[H7200]] any God [[H430]] but You, [[H2108]] who acts [[H6213]] on behalf of those who wait [[H2442]] for Him.  
5 You welcome [[H6293]] those who gladly [[H7797]] do [[H6213]] right, [[H6664]] who remember [[H2142]] Your ways. [[H1870]] Surely [[H2005]] You [[H859]] were angry, [[H7107]] for we sinned. [[H2398]] How can we be saved [[H3467]] if we remain in our sins? [[H5769]] 
6 All [[H3605]] of us have become [[H1961]] like one who is unclean, [[H2931]] and all [[H3605]] our righteous acts [[H6666]] are like a polluted [[H5708]] garment; [[H899]] we all [[H3605]] wither [[H5034]] like a leaf, [[H5929]] and our iniquities [[H5771]] carry us away [[H5375]] like the wind. [[H7307]] 
7 No [[H369]] one calls [[H7121]] on Your name [[H8034]] [or] strives [[H5782]] to take hold of You. [[H2388]] For [[H3588]] You have hidden [[H5641]] Your face [[H6440]] from us [[H4480]] and made us melt [[H4127]] in the hand [[H3027]] of our iniquity. [[H5771]] 
8 But now, [[H6258]] O LORD, [[H3069]] You [[H859]] are our Father; [[H1]] we [[H587]] are the clay, [[H2563]] and You [[H859]] are the potter; [[H3335]] we are all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of Your hand. [[H3027]] 
9 Do not [[H408]] be angry, [[H7107]] O LORD, [[H3068]] beyond [[H5704]] measure; [[H3966]] do not [[H408]] remember [[H2142]] our iniquity [[H5771]] forever. [[H5703]] Oh, [[H2005]] look upon us, [[H5027]] we pray; [[H4994]] we are all [[H3605]] Your people! [[H5971]] 
10 Your holy [[H6944]] cities [[H5892]] have become [[H1961]] a wilderness; [[H4057]] Zion [[H6726]] has become [[H1961]] a wasteland, [[H4057]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a desolation. [[H8077]] 
11 Our holy [[H6944]] and beautiful [[H8597]] temple, [[H1004]] where [[H834]] our fathers [[H1]] praised You, [[H1984]] has been [[H1961]] burned [[H8316]] with fire, [[H784]] and all [[H3605]] that was dear to us [[H4261]] lies [[H1961]] in ruins. [[H2723]] 
12 After [[H5921]] all this, [[H428]] O LORD, [[H3068]] will You restrain Yourself? [[H662]] Will You keep silent [[H2814]] and afflict [[H6031]] us beyond [[H5704]] measure? [[H3966]]
