# Isaiah 26
[[Isaiah 25|←]] • [[Isaiah 27|→]]
1 In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] this [[H2088]] song [[H7892]] will be sung [[H7891]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah: [[H3063]] We have a strong [[H5794]] city. [[H5892]] Salvation [[H3444]] is established [[H7896]] as its walls [[H2346]] and ramparts. [[H2426]] 
2 Open [[H6605]] the gates [[H8179]] that a righteous [[H6662]] nation [[H1471]] may enter— [[H935]] one that remains [[H8104]] faithful. [[H529]] 
3 The steadfast [[H5564]] of mind [[H3336]] You will keep [[H5341]] in perfect [[H7965]] peace, [[H7965]] because [[H3588]] he trusts [[H982]] in You.  
4 Trust [[H982]] in the LORD [[H3068]] forever, [[H5704]] because [[H3588]] GOD [[H3050]] the LORD [[H3068]] [is] the Rock [[H6697]] eternal. [[H5769]] 
5 For [[H3588]] He has humbled [[H7817]] those who dwell [[H3427]] on high— [[H4791]] He lays [[H8213]] the lofty [[H7682]] city {low}. [[H7151]] He brings it down [[H8213]] to [[H5704]] the ground; [[H776]] He casts [[H5060]] it into [[H5704]] the dust. [[H6083]] 
6 Feet [[H7272]] trample it down— [[H7429]] the feet [[H7272]] of the oppressed, [[H6041]] the steps [[H6471]] of the poor. [[H1800]] 
7 The path [[H734]] of the righteous [[H6662]] is level; [[H4339]] You clear [[H6424]] a straight [[H6662]] path [[H4570]] for the righteous. [[H3477]] 
8 Yes, [[H637]] we wait for You, [[H6960]] O LORD; [[H3068]] [we walk] in the path [[H734]] of Your judgments. [[H4941]] Your name [[H8034]] and renown [[H2143]] are the desire [[H8378]] of [our] souls. [[H5315]] 
9 My soul [[H5315]] longs [for You] [[H183]] in the night; [[H3915]] indeed, [[H637]] my spirit [[H7307]] within me [[H7130]] diligently seeks You. [[H7836]] For [[H3588]] when [[H834]] Your judgments [[H4941]] [come] upon the earth, [[H776]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the world [[H8398]] will learn [[H3925]] righteousness. [[H6664]] 
10 Though grace is shown [[H2603]] to the wicked man, [[H7563]] he does not [[H1077]] learn [[H3925]] righteousness. [[H6664]] In the land [[H776]] of righteousness [[H5229]] he acts unjustly [[H5765]] and fails [[H1077]] to see [[H7200]] the majesty [[H1348]] of the LORD. [[H3069]] 
11 O LORD, [[H3068]] Your hand [[H3027]] is upraised, [[H7311]] but they do not [[H1077]] see it. [[H2372]] They will see [[H2372]] Your zeal [[H7068]] for Your people, [[H5971]] and be put to shame. [[H954]] The fire set [[H784]] for Your enemies [[H6862]] will consume them! [[H398]] 
12 O LORD, [[H3068]] You will establish [[H8239]] peace for us, [[H7965]] for, [[H3588]] indeed, [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] that we have accomplished, [[H4639]] You have done [[H6466]] for us.  
13 O LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] [other] lords [[H113]] besides You [[H2108]] have had dominion, [[H1166]] but Your name [[H8034]] alone [[H905]] do we confess. [[H2142]] 
14 The dead [[H4191]] will not [[H1077]] live; [[H2421]] the departed spirits [[H7496]] will not [[H1077]] rise. [[H6965]] Therefore [[H3651]] You have punished [[H6485]] and destroyed them; [[H8045]] You have wiped out [[H6]] all [[H3605]] memory of them. [[H2143]] 
15 You have enlarged [[H3254]] the nation, [[H1471]] O LORD; [[H3068]] You have increased [[H3254]] the nation. [[H1471]] You are glorified. [[H3513]] You have extended [[H7368]] the borders [[H7099]] of the land. [[H776]] 
16 O LORD, [[H3068]] they sought You [[H6485]] in their distress; [[H6862]] when You disciplined them, [[H4148]] they poured out [[H6694]] a quiet prayer. [[H3908]] 
17 As [[H3644]] a woman with child [[H2030]] [and] about [[H7126]] to give birth [[H3205]] writhes [[H2342]] and cries out [[H2199]] in pain, [[H2256]] that is how [[H3651]] we were [[H1961]] in Your presence, [[H6440]] O LORD. [[H3068]] 
18 We were pregnant, [[H2030]] we writhed in pain, [[H2342]] we gave birth to [[H3205]] wind. [[H7307]] We have brought [[H6213]] no [[H1077]] salvation [[H3444]] to the earth, [[H776]] nor [[H1077]] brought [[H5307]] any life [[H3427]] into the world. [[H8398]] 
19 Your dead [[H4191]] will live; [[H2421]] their bodies [[H5038]] will rise. [[H6965]] Awake [[H6974]] and sing, [[H7442]] you who dwell [[H7931]] in the dust! [[H6083]] For [[H3588]] your dew [[H2919]] is like the dew [[H2919]] of the morning, [[H219]] and the earth [[H776]] will bring forth [[H5307]] her dead. [[H7496]] 
20 Go, [[H1980]] my people, [[H5971]] enter [[H935]] your rooms [[H2315]] and shut [[H5462]] your doors [[H1817]] behind you. [[H1157]] Hide yourselves [[H2247]] a little [[H4592]] while [[H7281]] until [[H5704]] the wrath [[H5674]] has passed. [[H5674]] 
21 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] is coming [[H3318]] out of His dwelling [[H4725]] to punish [[H6485]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the earth [[H776]] for their iniquity. [[H5771]] The earth [[H776]] will reveal [[H1540]] her bloodshed [[H1818]] and no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] conceal [[H3680]] her slain. [[H2026]]
