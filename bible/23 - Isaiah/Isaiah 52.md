# Isaiah 52
[[Isaiah 51|←]] • [[Isaiah 53|→]]
1 Awaken, [[H5782]] awaken, [[H5782]] clothe yourself [[H3847]] with strength, [[H5797]] O Zion! [[H6726]] Put on [[H3847]] your garments [[H899]] of splendor, [[H8597]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Holy [[H6944]] City! [[H5892]] For [[H3588]] the uncircumcised [[H6189]] and unclean [[H2931]] will not [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] enter you. [[H935]] 
2 Shake off [[H5287]] your dust! [[H6083]] Rise up [[H6965]] [and] sit [on your throne], [[H3427]] O Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Remove [[H6605]] the chains [[H4147]] from your neck, [[H6677]] O captive [[H7628]] Daughter [[H1323]] Zion. [[H6726]] 
3 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “You were sold [[H4376]] for nothing, [[H2600]] and without [[H3808]] money [[H3701]] you will be redeemed. [[H1350]] 
4 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “At first [[H7223]] My people [[H5971]] went down [[H3381]] to Egypt [[H4714]] to live, [[H1481]] then Assyria [[H804]] oppressed them [[H6231]] without cause. [[H657]] 
5 And now [[H6258]] what [[H4100]] have I here? [[H6311]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] My people [[H5971]] have been taken [[H3947]] without cause; [[H2600]] those who rule [[H4910]] them  taunt, [[H3213]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and My name [[H8034]] [is] blasphemed [[H5006]] all day long. [[H3605]] 
6 Therefore [[H3651]] My people [[H5971]] will know [[H3045]] My name; [[H8034]] therefore [[H3651]] they will know [[H1931]] on that day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am He [[H1931]] who speaks. [[H1696]] Here I am!” [[H2005]] 
7 How [[H4100]] beautiful [[H4998]] on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] are the feet [[H7272]] of those who bring good news, [[H1319]] who proclaim [[H8085]] peace, [[H7965]] who bring [[H1319]] good tidings, [[H2896]] who proclaim [[H8085]] salvation, [[H3444]] who say [[H559]] to Zion, [[H6726]] “Your God [[H430]] reigns!” [[H4427]] 
8 Listen! [[H6963]] Your watchmen [[H6822]] lift up [[H5375]] their voices, [[H6963]] together [[H3162]] they shout for joy, [[H7442]] for [[H3588]] every eye [[H5869]] will see [[H7200]] when the LORD [[H3068]] returns [[H7725]] to Zion. [[H6726]] 
9 Break forth in joy, [[H6476]] sing [[H7442]] together, [[H3162]] O ruins [[H2723]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has comforted [[H5162]] His people; [[H5971]] He has redeemed [[H1350]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
10 The LORD [[H3068]] has bared [[H2834]] His holy [[H6944]] arm [[H2220]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the nations; [[H1471]] all [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth [[H776]] will see [[H7200]] the salvation [[H3444]] of our God. [[H430]] 
11 Depart, [[H5493]] depart, [[H5493]] go out [[H3318]] from there! [[H8033]] Touch [[H5060]] no [[H408]] unclean thing; [[H2931]] come out [[H3318]] from it, [[H8432]] purify yourselves, [[H1305]] you who carry [[H5375]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 For [[H3588]] you will not [[H3808]] leave [[H3318]] in a hurry, [[H2649]] and you will not have to take flight; [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] goes [[H1980]] before you, [[H6440]] and the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] is your rear guard. [[H622]] 
13 Behold, [[H2009]] My Servant [[H5650]] will act wisely; [[H7919]] He will be raised [[H7311]] and lifted up [[H5375]] and highly [[H3966]] exalted— [[H1361]] 
14 just as [[H834]] many [[H7227]] were appalled [[H8074]] at You— [[H5921]] His appearance [[H4758]] was disfigured [[H4893]] beyond that of any man, [[H376]] and His form [[H8389]] [was marred] beyond human likeness— [[H1121]] 
15 so [[H3651]] He will sprinkle [[H5137]] many [[H7227]] nations. [[H1471]] Kings [[H4428]] will shut [[H7092]] their mouths [[H6310]] because of Him. [[H5921]] For [[H3588]] they will see [[H7200]] what [[H834]] they have not [[H3808]] been told, [[H5608]] and they will understand [[H995]] what [[H834]] they have not [[H3808]] heard. [[H8085]]
