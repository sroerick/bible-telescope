# Isaiah 7
[[Isaiah 6|←]] • [[Isaiah 8|→]]
1 Now [[H1961]] in the days that [[H3117]] Ahaz [[H271]] son [[H1121]] of Jotham, [[H3147]] the son [[H1121]] of Uzziah, [[H5818]] [was] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Rezin [[H7526]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] marched up [[H5927]] to [wage] war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] He was accompanied by Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah [[H7425]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] but he could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] overpower [[H3898]] [the city]. [[H5921]] 
2 When it became known [[H5046]] to the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] that Aram [[H758]] was in league with [[H5117]] Ephraim, [[H669]] the hearts [[H3824]] of Ahaz [[H3824]] and his people [[H5971]] trembled [[H5128]] like trees [[H6086]] in the forest [[H3293]] shaken [[H5128]] by the wind. [[H7307]] 
3 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] “Go out [[H3318]] with your son [[H1121]] Shear-jashub [[H7610]] to meet [[H7125]] Ahaz [[H271]] at [[H413]] the end [[H7097]] of the aqueduct [[H8585]] [that feeds] the upper [[H5945]] pool, [[H1295]] on [[H413]] the road [[H4546]] to the Launderer’s [[H3526]] Field, [[H7704]] 
4 and say [[H559]] to him: [[H413]] ‘Calm down [[H8104]] and be quiet. [[H8252]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or fainthearted [[H3824]] over these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] smoldering [[H6226]] stubs [[H2180]] of firewood, [[H181]] over the fierce [[H2750]] anger [[H639]] of Rezin [[H7526]] and Aram [[H758]] and of the son [[H1121]] of Remaliah. [[H7425]] 
5 For [[H3282]] Aram, [[H758]] along with Ephraim [[H669]] and the son [[H1121]] of Remaliah, [[H7425]] has plotted [[H3289]] your ruin, [[H7451]] saying, [[H559]] 
6 ‘Let us invade [[H5927]] Judah, [[H3063]] terrorize it, [[H6973]] and conquer it [[H1234]] for ourselves. [[H413]] Then we can install [[H4428]] the son [[H1121]] of Tabeal [[H2870]] over it [[H8432]] as king.’” [[H4427]] 
7 But this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “It will not [[H3808]] arise; [[H6965]] it will not [[H3808]] happen. [[H1961]] 
8 For [[H3588]] the head [[H7218]] of Aram [[H758]] is Damascus, [[H1834]] [and] the head [[H7218]] of Damascus [[H1834]] is Rezin. [[H7526]] Within [[H1157]] sixty-five [[H8346]] years [[H8141]] Ephraim [[H669]] will be too shattered [[H2844]] to be a people. [[H5971]] 
9 The head [[H7218]] of Ephraim [[H669]] is Samaria, [[H8111]] and the head [[H7218]] of Samaria [[H8111]] is the son [[H1121]] of Remaliah. [[H7425]] If [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] stand firm in your faith, [[H539]] then [[H3588]] you will not [[H3808]] stand at all.” [[H539]] 
10 Again [[H3254]] the LORD [[H3069]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Ahaz: [[H271]] 
11 “Ask for [[H7592]] a sign [[H226]] from [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] [whether] from the depths [[H6009]] of Sheol [[H7585]] or [[H176]] the heights [[H1361]] of heaven.” [[H4605]] 
12 But Ahaz [[H271]] replied, [[H559]] “I will not [[H3808]] ask; [[H7592]] I will not [[H3808]] test [[H5254]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
13 Then Isaiah said, [[H559]] “Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] O house [[H1004]] of David! [[H1732]] Is it not enough [[H4592]] to try the patience [[H3811]] of men? [[H376]] Will you try the patience [[H3811]] of my God [[H430]] as well? [[H1571]] 
14 Therefore [[H3651]] the Lord [[H136]] Himself [[H1931]] will give [[H5414]] you a sign: [[H226]] Behold, [[H2009]] the virgin [[H5959]] will be with child [[H2030]] and will give birth [[H3205]] to a son, [[H1121]] and she will call [[H7121]] Him [[H8034]] Immanuel. [[H6005]] 
15 By the time He knows [enough] [[H3045]] to reject [[H3988]] evil [[H7451]] and choose [[H977]] good, [[H2896]] He will be eating [[H398]] curds [[H2529]] and honey. [[H1706]] 
16 For [[H3588]] before [[H2962]] the boy [[H5288]] knows [enough] [[H3045]] to reject [[H3988]] evil [[H7451]] and choose [[H977]] good, [[H2896]] the land [[H127]] of the two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] you [[H859]] dread [[H6973]] will be laid waste. [[H5800]] 
17 The LORD [[H3068]] will bring [[H935]] on you [[H5921]] and on [[H5921]] your people [[H5971]] and on [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of your father [[H1]] a time [[H3117]] unlike [[H3808]] [any since] the day [[H3117]] Ephraim [[H669]] separated [[H5493]] from Judah— [[H3063]] [He will bring] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria.” [[H804]] 
18 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] will whistle [[H8319]] to the flies [[H2070]] at the farthest [[H7097]] streams [[H2975]] of the Nile [[H4714]] and to the bees [[H1682]] in the land [[H776]] of Assyria. [[H804]] 
19 And they will all [[H3605]] come [[H935]] and settle [[H5117]] in the steep [[H1327]] ravines [[H5158]] and clefts [[H5357]] of the rocks, [[H5553]] in all [[H3605]] the thornbushes [[H5285]] and [[H3605]] watering holes. [[H5097]] 
20 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H136]] will use a razor [[H8593]] hired [[H7917]] from beyond [[H5676]] the Euphrates— [[H5104]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria— [[H804]] to shave [[H1548]] your head [[H7218]] and the hair [[H8181]] of your legs, [[H7272]] and to remove [[H5595]] your beard [[H2206]] as well. [[H1571]] 
21 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] a man [[H376]] will raise [[H2421]] a young cow [[H5697]] and two [[H8147]] sheep, [[H6629]] 
22 and from [[H1961]] the abundant [[H7230]] milk [[H2461]] they give, [[H6213]] he will eat [[H398]] curds; [[H2529]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] who remain [[H3498]] in [[H7130]] the land [[H776]] will eat [[H398]] curds [[H2529]] and honey. [[H1706]] 
23 And on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] in every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] there used to be [[H1961]] a thousand [[H505]] vines [[H1612]] worth a thousand [shekels] [[H505]] of silver, [[H3701]] there will be only [[H1961]] thorns [[H7898]] and briers. [[H8068]] 
24 Men will go [[H935]] there [[H8033]] with bow [[H7198]] and arrow, [[H2678]] for [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] will be [[H1961]] [covered with] [[H3605]] thorns [[H7898]] and briers. [[H8068]] 
25 For fear [[H3374]] of the thorns [[H7898]] and briers, [[H8068]] you will no longer [[H3808]] traverse [[H935]] the hills [[H2022]] once tilled [[H5737]] by the hoe; [[H4576]] they will become [[H1961]] [places] for oxen [[H7794]] to graze [[H4916]] and sheep [[H7716]] to trample. [[H4823]]
