# Isaiah 65
[[Isaiah 64|←]] • [[Isaiah 66|→]]
1 “I revealed Myself [[H1875]] to those who did not [[H3808]] ask for Me; [[H7592]] I was found [[H4672]] by those who did not [[H3808]] seek Me. [[H1245]] I said, [[H559]] ‘Here I am! [[H2005]] Here I am!’ [[H2005]] to [[H413]] a nation [[H1471]] that did not [[H3808]] call [[H7121]] My name. [[H8034]] 
2 All day long [[H3605]] I have held out [[H6566]] My hands [[H3027]] to [[H413]] an obstinate [[H5637]] people, [[H5971]] who walk [[H1980]] in the wrong [[H3808]] path, [[H1870]] who follow [[H310]] their own imaginations, [[H4284]] 
3 to a people [[H5971]] who continually [[H8548]] provoke Me [[H3707]] to [[H5921]] My face, [[H6440]] sacrificing [[H2076]] in the gardens [[H1593]] and burning incense [[H6999]] on [[H5921]] altars of brick, [[H3843]] 
4 sitting [[H3427]] among the graves, [[H6913]] spending nights [[H3885]] in secret places, [[H5341]] eating [[H398]] the meat [[H1320]] of pigs [[H2386]] and polluted broth [[H6292]] from their bowls. [[H3627]] 
5 They say, [[H559]] ‘Keep [[H7126]] to yourself, [[H413]] do not [[H408]] come near me, [[H5066]] for [[H3588]] I am holier than you!’ [[H6942]] Such people [[H428]] are smoke [[H6227]] in My nostrils, [[H639]] a fire [[H784]] that burns [[H3344]] all day long. [[H3605]] 
6 Behold, [[H2009]] it is written [[H3789]] before Me: [[H6440]] I will not [[H3808]] keep silent, [[H2814]] but [[H3588]] I will repay; [[H7999]] I will pay it back [[H7999]] into [[H5921]] their laps [[H2436]] 
7 both [[H3162]] for your iniquities [[H5771]] and [those] [[H5771]] of your fathers,” [[H1]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Because [[H834]] they burned incense [[H6999]] on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] and scorned Me [[H2778]] on [[H5921]] the hills, [[H1389]] I will measure [[H4058]] into [[H413]] their laps  full payment for their former [[H7223]] deeds.” [[H6468]] 
8 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “As [[H834]] the new wine [[H8492]] is found [[H4672]] in a cluster of grapes, [[H811]] and men say, [[H559]] ‘Do not [[H408]] destroy it, [[H7843]] for [[H3588]] it contains  a blessing,’ [[H1293]] so [[H3651]] I will act [[H6213]] on behalf [[H4616]] of My servants: [[H5650]] I will not [[H1115]] destroy [[H7843]] them all. [[H3605]] 
9 And I will bring forth [[H3318]] descendants [[H2233]] from Jacob, [[H3290]] and heirs [[H3423]] to My mountains [[H2022]] out of Judah; [[H3063]] My elect [[H972]] will possess it, [[H3423]] and My servants [[H5650]] will dwell [[H7931]] there. [[H8033]] 
10 Sharon [[H8289]] will become [[H1961]] a pasture [[H5116]] for flocks, [[H6629]] and the Valley [[H6010]] of Achor [[H5911]] a resting place [[H7258]] for the herds, [[H1241]] for My people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] seek Me. [[H1875]] 
11 But you [[H859]] who forsake [[H5800]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who forget [[H7911]] My holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] who set [[H6186]] a table [[H7979]] for Fortune [[H1409]] and fill [[H4390]] bowls of mixed wine [[H4469]] for Destiny, [[H4507]] 
12 I will destine [[H4487]] you [[H853]] for the sword, [[H2719]] and you will all [[H3605]] kneel down [[H3766]] to be slaughtered, [[H2874]] because [[H3282]] I called [[H7121]] and you did not [[H3808]] answer, [[H6030]] I spoke [[H1696]] and you did not [[H3808]] listen; [[H8085]] you did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in My sight [[H5869]] and chose [[H977]] that in which [[H834]] I did not [[H3808]] delight. [[H2654]] 
13 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “My servants [[H5650]] will eat, [[H398]] but you [[H859]] will go hungry; [[H7456]] My servants [[H5650]] will drink, [[H8354]] but you [[H859]] will go thirsty; [[H6770]] My servants [[H5650]] will rejoice, [[H8055]] but you [[H859]] will be put to shame. [[H954]] 
14 My servants [[H5650]] will shout for joy [[H7442]] with a glad [[H2898]] heart, [[H3820]] but you [[H859]] will cry out [[H6817]] with a heavy [[H3511]] heart [[H3820]] and wail [[H3213]] with a broken [[H7667]] spirit. [[H7307]] 
15 You will leave behind [[H3240]] your name [[H8034]] as a curse [[H7621]] for My chosen ones, [[H972]] and the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] will slay you, [[H4191]] but to His servants [[H5650]] He will give [[H7121]] another [[H312]] name. [[H8034]] 
16 Whoever [[H834]] invokes a blessing [[H1288]] in the land [[H776]] will [do so] [[H1288]] by the God [[H430]] of truth, [[H543]] and whoever takes an oath [[H7650]] in the land [[H776]] will swear [[H7650]] by the God [[H430]] of truth. [[H543]] For [[H3588]] the former [[H7223]] troubles [[H6869]] will be forgotten [[H7911]] and hidden [[H5641]] from My sight. [[H5869]] 
17 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I will create [[H1254]] new [[H2319]] heavens [[H8064]] and a new [[H2319]] earth. [[H776]] The former things [[H7223]] will not [[H3808]] be remembered, [[H2142]] nor [[H3808]] will they come [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] mind. [[H3820]] 
18 But be glad [[H7797]] and rejoice [[H1523]] forever [[H5704]] in what [[H834]] I [[H589]] create; [[H1254]] for [[H3588]] I will create [[H1254]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] to be a joy [[H1525]] and its people [[H5971]] to be a delight. [[H4885]] 
19 I will rejoice [[H1523]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and take delight [[H7797]] in My people. [[H5971]] The sounds [[H6963]] of weeping [[H1065]] and crying [[H2201]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be heard [[H8085]] in her.  
20 No [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] will a nursing infant [[H5764]] live [[H1961]] but a few days, [[H3117]] or an old man [[H2205]] not [[H3808]] live out [[H4390]] his days. [[H3117]] For [[H3588]] the youth [[H5288]] will die [[H4191]] at a hundred [[H3967]] years, [[H1121]] and he who fails [[H2398]] [to reach] a hundred [[H3967]] will be considered accursed. [[H7043]] 
21 They will build [[H1129]] houses [[H1004]] and dwell in them; [[H3427]] they will plant [[H5193]] vineyards [[H3754]] and eat [[H398]] their fruit. [[H6529]] 
22 No longer [[H3808]] will they build houses [[H1129]] for others [[H312]] to inhabit, [[H3427]] nor [[H3808]] plant [[H5193]] for others [[H312]] to eat. [[H398]] For [[H3588]] [as is] the lifetime [[H3117]] of a tree, [[H6086]] so will be the days [[H3117]] of My people, [[H5971]] and My chosen ones [[H972]] will fully enjoy [[H1086]] the work [[H4639]] of their hands. [[H3027]] 
23 They will not [[H3808]] labor [[H3021]] in vain [[H7385]] [or] [[H3808]] bear children [[H3205]] doomed to disaster; [[H928]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] will be a people [[H2233]] blessed [[H1288]] by the LORD— [[H3069]] [they] and their descendants [[H6631]] with them. [[H854]] 
24 Even before [[H2962]] they call, [[H7121]] I [[H589]] will answer, [[H6030]] and while they [[H1992]] are still [[H5750]] speaking, [[H1696]] I [[H589]] will hear. [[H8085]] 
25 The wolf [[H2061]] and the lamb [[H2924]] will feed together, [[H7462]] and the lion [[H738]] will eat [[H398]] straw [[H8401]] like the ox, [[H1241]] but the food [[H3899]] of the serpent [[H5175]] will be dust. [[H6083]] They will do no [[H3808]] harm [[H7489]] nor [[H3808]] destruction [[H7843]] on all My [[H3605]] holy [[H6944]] mountain,” [[H2022]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
