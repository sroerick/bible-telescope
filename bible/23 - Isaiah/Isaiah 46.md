# Isaiah 46
[[Isaiah 45|←]] • [[Isaiah 47|→]]
1 Bel [[H1078]] crouches; [[H3766]] Nebo [[H5015]] cowers. [[H7164]] Their idols [[H6091]] [weigh down] beasts [[H2416]] and cattle. [[H929]] The images you carry [[H5385]] are burdensome, [[H6006]] a load [[H4853]] to the weary [animal]. [[H5889]] 
2 The gods cower; [[H7164]] they crouch [[H3766]] together, [[H3162]] unable [[H3201]] to relieve [[H4422]] the burden; [[H4853]] but they [[H5315]] themselves go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]] 
3 Listen [[H8085]] to Me, [[H413]] O house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who have been sustained [[H6006]] from [[H4480]] the womb, [[H990]] carried along [[H5375]] since [[H4480]] birth. [[H7356]] 
4 Even to [[H5704]] your old age, [[H2209]] I [[H589]] will be the same, [[H1931]] and I [[H589]] will bear you up [[H5445]] when [[H5704]] you turn gray. [[H7872]] I [[H589]] have made you, [[H6213]] and I [[H589]] will carry you; [[H5375]] I [[H589]] will sustain you [[H5445]] and deliver you. [[H4422]] 
5 To whom [[H4310]] will you liken Me [[H1819]] or count Me equal? [[H7737]] To whom will you compare Me, [[H4911]] that we should be alike? [[H1819]] 
6 Those who pour out [[H2107]] their bags [[H3599]] of gold [[H2091]] and weigh out [[H8254]] silver [[H3701]] on scales [[H7070]] hire [[H7936]] a goldsmith [[H6884]] to fashion it [[H6213]] into a god [[H410]] they can bow down [[H5456]] and [[H637]] worship. [[H7812]] 
7 They lift [[H5375]] it to [[H5921]] their shoulder [[H3802]] and carry it along; [[H5445]] they set [[H3240]] it in its place, [[H8478]] and there it stands, [[H5975]] not [[H3808]] budging [[H4185]] from [[H637]] that spot. [[H4725]] They cry out [[H6817]] to it, [[H413]] but it does not [[H3808]] answer; [[H6030]] it saves [[H3467]] no one [[H3808]] from his troubles. [[H6869]] 
8 Remember [[H2142]] this [[H2063]] and be brave; [[H377]] take [[H7725]] it to [[H5921]] heart, [[H3820]] you transgressors! [[H6586]] 
9 Remember [[H2142]] what happened [[H7223]] long ago, [[H5769]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am God, [[H410]] and there is no [[H369]] other; [[H5750]] I am God, [[H430]] and [there is] none [[H657]] like Me. [[H3644]] 
10 I distinguish [[H5046]] the end [[H319]] from the beginning, [[H7225]] and ancient times [[H6924]] from what [[H834]] is still [[H3808]] to come, [[H6213]] saying: [[H559]] ‘My purpose [[H6098]] will be established, [[H6965]] and I will accomplish [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] My good pleasure.’ [[H2656]] 
11 I summon [[H7121]] a bird of prey [[H5861]] from the east, [[H4217]] a man [[H376]] for My purpose [[H6098]] from a far-off [[H4801]] land. [[H776]] Truly [[H637]] I have spoken, [[H1696]] truly [[H637]] I will bring it to pass. [[H935]] I have planned it, [[H3335]] I will surely [[H637]] do it. [[H6213]] 
12 Listen [[H8085]] to Me, [[H413]] you stubborn [[H47]] people, [[H3820]] far removed [[H7350]] from righteousness: [[H6666]] 
13 I am bringing My righteousness [[H6666]] near; [[H7126]] it is not [[H3808]] far away, [[H7368]] and My salvation [[H8668]] will not [[H3808]] be delayed. [[H309]] I will grant [[H5414]] salvation [[H8668]] to Zion, [[H6726]] My splendor [[H8597]] to Israel. [[H3478]]
