# Isaiah 37
[[Isaiah 36|←]] • [[Isaiah 38|→]]
1 On [[H1961]] hearing [this report], [[H8085]] King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] tore [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] put on [[H3680]] sackcloth, [[H8242]] and entered [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 He sent [[H7971]] Eliakim [[H471]] the palace [[H1004]] administrator, [[H5921]] Shebna [[H7644]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and the leading [[H2205]] priests, [[H3548]] all wearing [[H3680]] sackcloth, [[H8242]] to [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] 
3 to tell [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “This is what [[H3541]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] says: [[H559]] Today [[H3117]] is a day [[H3117]] of distress, [[H6869]] rebuke, [[H8433]] and disgrace; [[H5007]] for [[H3588]] children [[H1121]] have come [[H935]] to the point of [[H5704]] birth, [[H4866]] but there is no [[H369]] strength [[H3581]] to deliver them. [[H3205]] 
4 Perhaps [[H194]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] will hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the Rab-shakeh, [[H7262]] whom [[H834]] his master [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] has sent [[H7971]] to defy [[H2778]] the living [[H2416]] God, [[H430]] and He will rebuke him [[H3198]] for the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] has heard. [[H8085]] Therefore lift up [[H5375]] a prayer [[H8605]] for [[H1157]] the remnant [[H7611]] that still survives. [[H4672]] 
5 So the servants [[H5650]] of King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] 
6 who [[H3470]] replied, [[H559]] “Tell [[H559]] your master [[H113]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] the words [[H1697]] you have heard, [[H8085]] with which [[H834]] the servants [[H5288]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] have blasphemed Me. [[H1442]] 
7 Behold, [[H2005]] I will put [[H5414]] a spirit [[H7307]] in him  so that he will hear [[H8085]] a rumor [[H8052]] and return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his own land, [[H776]] where [[H776]] I will cause him to fall [[H5307]] by the sword.’” [[H2719]] 
8 When [[H3588]] the Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the king of Assyria had left [[H5265]] Lachish, [[H3923]] he withdrew [[H7725]] and found [[H4672]] the king [[H4428]] fighting [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] Libnah. [[H3841]] 
9 Now Sennacherib had been warned [[H8085]] about [[H5921]] Tirhakah [[H8640]] king [[H4428]] of Cush: [[H3568]] “He has set out [[H3318]] to fight [[H3898]] against you.” [[H854]] On hearing this, [[H8085]] Sennacherib sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] with the order: [[H559]] 
10 “Tell [[H559]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] ‘Do not [[H408]] let your God, [[H430]] in whom [[H834]] you [[H859]] trust, [[H982]] deceive you [[H5377]] by promising [[H559]] that Jerusalem [[H3389]] will not [[H3808]] be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] 
11 Surely [[H2009]] you [[H859]] have heard [[H8085]] what [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] have done [[H6213]] to all [the other] [[H3605]] countries, [[H776]] destroying them completely. [[H2763]] Will you then [[H859]] be spared? [[H5337]] 
12 Did the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H1471]] my fathers [[H1]] destroyed [[H7843]] rescue them— [[H5337]] [the gods of] [[H853]] Gozan, [[H1470]] Haran, [[H2771]] Rezeph, [[H7530]] and the people [[H1121]] of Eden [[H5729]] in Telassar? [[H8515]] 
13 Where [[H346]] are the kings [[H4428]] of Hamath, [[H2574]] Arpad, [[H774]] Sepharvaim, [[H5617]] Hena, [[H2012]] and Ivvah?’” [[H5755]] 
14 So Hezekiah [[H2396]] received [[H3947]] the letter [[H5612]] from [[H3027]] the messengers, [[H4397]] read it, [[H7121]] and went up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and spread it out [[H6566]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 And Hezekiah [[H2396]] prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD: [[H3068]] 
16 “O LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] enthroned [[H3427]] above the cherubim, [[H3742]] You [[H859]] alone [[H905]] are God [[H430]] over all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth. [[H776]] You [[H859]] made [[H6213]] the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth. [[H776]] 
17 Incline [[H5186]] Your ear, [[H241]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and hear; [[H8085]] open [[H6491]] Your eyes, [[H5869]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and see. [[H7200]] Listen to [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] has sent [[H7971]] to defy [[H2778]] the living [[H2416]] God. [[H430]] 
18 Truly, [[H551]] O LORD, [[H3068]] the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] have laid waste [[H2717]] all [[H3605]] these countries [[H776]] and their lands. [[H776]] 
19 They have cast [[H5414]] their gods [[H430]] into the fire [[H784]] and destroyed them, [[H6]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] were not [[H3808]] gods, [[H430]] but only [[H3588]] wood [[H6086]] and stone— [[H68]] the work [[H4639]] of human [[H120]] hands. [[H3027]] 
20 And now, [[H6258]] O LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] deliver us [[H3467]] from his hand, [[H3027]] so that all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth [[H776]] may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] You [[H859]] alone, [[H905]] O LORD, are God.” [[H3068]] 
21 Then Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] sent a message [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah: [[H2396]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] Because [[H834]] you prayed [[H6419]] to Me [[H413]] concerning [[H413]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] 
22 this [[H2088]] is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken [[H1696]] against him: [[H5921]] ‘The Virgin [[H1330]] Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] despises [[H959]] you  and mocks [[H3932]] you;  the Daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] shakes [[H5128]] her head [[H7218]] behind you. [[H310]] 
23 Whom [[H4310]] have you taunted [[H2778]] and blasphemed? [[H1442]] Against [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] have you raised [[H7311]] your voice [[H6963]] and lifted [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] in pride? [[H4791]] Against [[H413]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel! [[H3478]] 
24 Through [[H3027]] your servants [[H5650]] you have taunted [[H2778]] the Lord, [[H136]] and you have said [[H559]] “With my many [[H7230]] chariots [[H7393]] I [[H589]] have ascended [[H5927]] to the heights [[H4791]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] to the far recesses [[H3411]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]] I have cut down [[H3772]] its tallest [[H6967]] cedars, [[H730]] the finest [[H4005]] of its cypress trees. [[H1265]] I have reached [[H935]] its farthest [[H7093]] heights, [[H4791]] the densest [[H3759]] of its forests. [[H3293]] 
25 I [[H589]] have dug wells [[H6979]] and drunk foreign [[H8354]] waters. [[H4325]] With the soles [[H3709]] of my feet [[H6471]] I have dried up [[H2717]] all [[H3605]] the streams [[H2975]] of Egypt.” [[H4693]] 
26 Have you not [[H3808]] heard? [[H8085]] Long ago [[H7350]] I ordained it; [[H6213]] in days [[H3117]] of old [[H6924]] I planned it. [[H3335]] Now I have [[H6258]] brought it to pass, [[H935]] that you should crush [[H7582]] fortified [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] into piles [[H1530]] of rubble. [[H5327]] 
27 Therefore their inhabitants, [[H3427]] devoid [[H7116]] of power, [[H3027]] are dismayed [[H2865]] and ashamed. [[H954]] They are [[H1961]] plants [[H6212]] of the field, [[H7704]] tender [[H3419]] green shoots, [[H1877]] grass [[H2682]] on the roofs, [[H1406]] scorched [[H7709]] before [[H6440]] it is grown. [[H7054]] 
28 But I know [[H3045]] your sitting down, [[H3427]] your going out [[H3318]] and coming in, [[H935]] and your raging [[H7264]] against Me. [[H413]] 
29 Because [[H3282]] your rage [[H7264]] and arrogance [[H7600]] against Me [[H413]] have reached [[H5927]] My ears, [[H241]] I will put [[H7760]] My hook [[H2397]] in your nose [[H639]] and My bit [[H4964]] in your mouth; [[H8193]] I will send you back [[H7725]] the way [[H1870]] you came.’ [[H935]] 
30 And this [[H2088]] will be a sign [[H226]] to you, [O Hezekiah]:  This year [[H8141]] you will eat [[H398]] what grows on its own, [[H5599]] and in the second [[H8145]] year [[H8141]] what springs from the same. [[H7823]] But in the third [[H7992]] year [[H8141]] you will sow [[H2232]] and reap; [[H7114]] you will plant [[H5193]] vineyards [[H3754]] and eat [[H398]] their fruit. [[H6529]] 
31 And the surviving [[H7604]] remnant [[H6413]] of the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] will again [[H3254]] take root [[H8328]] below [[H4295]] and bear [[H6213]] fruit [[H6529]] above. [[H4605]] 
32 For [[H3588]] a remnant [[H7611]] will go forth [[H3318]] from Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and survivors [[H6413]] from Mount [[H2022]] Zion. [[H6726]] The zeal [[H7068]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will accomplish [[H6213]] this. [[H2063]] 
33 So [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] about [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria: [[H804]] ‘He will not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] or shoot [[H3384]] an arrow [[H2671]] into it. [[H8033]] He will not come before it [[H6923]] with a shield [[H4043]] or build up [[H8210]] a siege ramp [[H5550]] against it. [[H5921]] 
34 He will go back [[H7725]] the way [[H1870]] he came, [[H935]] and he will not [[H3808]] enter [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
35 I will defend [[H1598]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] and rescue it [[H3467]] for My own sake [[H4616]] and for the sake [[H4616]] of My servant [[H5650]] David.’” [[H1732]] 
36 Then the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] went out [[H3318]] and struck down [[H5221]] 185,000 men [[H3967]] in the camp [[H4264]] of the Assyrians. [[H804]] When the people got up [[H7925]] the next morning, [[H1242]] there [[H2009]] were all [[H3605]] the dead [[H4191]] bodies! [[H6297]] 
37 So Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] broke camp [[H5265]] and withdrew. [[H1980]] He returned home [[H7725]] to Nineveh [[H5210]] and stayed there. [[H3427]] 
38 One day, [[H1961]] while he [[H1931]] was worshiping [[H7812]] in the temple [[H1004]] of his god [[H430]] Nisroch, [[H5268]] his sons [[H1121]] Adrammelech [[H152]] and Sharezer [[H8272]] struck him down [[H5221]] with the sword [[H2719]] and escaped [[H4422]] to the land [[H776]] of Ararat. [[H780]] And his son [[H1121]] Esar-haddon [[H634]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
