# Isaiah 14
[[Isaiah 13|←]] • [[Isaiah 15|→]]
1 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will have compassion [[H7355]] on Jacob [[H3290]] and choose [[H977]] Israel [[H3478]] once again. [[H5750]] He will settle them [[H3240]] on [[H5921]] their own land. [[H127]] The foreigner [[H1616]] will join them [[H3867]] and be united [[H5596]] with [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] 
2 The nations [[H5971]] will escort [Israel] [[H3947]] and bring [[H935]] it to [[H413]] its homeland. [[H4725]] Then the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] will possess [the nations] [[H5157]] as menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants [[H8198]] in [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] land. [[H127]] They will make [[H1961]] captives [[H7617]] of their captors [[H7617]] and rule [[H7287]] over their oppressors. [[H5065]] 
3 On the day that [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] gives you rest [[H5117]] from [[H4480]] your pain [[H6090]] and torment, [[H7267]] and from the hard [[H7186]] labor [[H5656]] into which [[H834]] you were forced, [[H5647]] 
4 you will sing [[H5375]] this [[H2088]] song of contempt [[H4912]] against [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon: [[H894]] How [[H349]] the oppressor [[H5065]] has ceased, [[H7673]] and how his fury [[H4062]] has ended! [[H7673]] 
5 The LORD [[H3068]] has broken [[H7665]] the staff [[H4294]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] the scepter [[H7626]] of the rulers. [[H4910]] 
6 It struck [[H5221]] the peoples [[H5971]] in anger [[H5678]] with unceasing [[H1115]] blows; [[H4347]] it subdued [[H7287]] the nations [[H1471]] in rage [[H639]] with relentless [[H1097]] persecution. [[H4783]] 
7 All [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] is at peace [[H8252]] and at rest; [[H5117]] they break out [[H6476]] in song. [[H7440]] 
8 Even [[H1571]] the cypresses [[H1265]] and cedars [[H730]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] exult [[H8055]] over you:  “Since [[H227]] you have been laid low, [[H7901]] no [[H3808]] woodcutter [[H3772]] comes [[H5927]] against us.” [[H5921]] 
9 Sheol [[H7585]] beneath [[H8478]] is eager [[H7264]] to meet you [[H7125]] upon your arrival. [[H935]] It stirs [[H5782]] the spirits of the dead [[H7496]] to greet you—  all [[H3605]] the rulers [[H6260]] of the earth. [[H776]] It makes all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the nations [[H1471]] rise [[H6965]] from their thrones. [[H3678]] 
10 They will all [[H3605]] respond [[H6030]] and say [[H559]] to you, [[H413]] “You [[H859]] too [[H1571]] have become weak [[H2470]] as [[H3644]] we are; [[H413]] you have become like us!” [[H4911]] 
11 Your pomp [[H1347]] has been brought down [[H3381]] to Sheol, [[H7585]] with the music [[H1998]] of your harps. [[H5035]] Maggots [[H7415]] spread out [[H3331]] beneath you, [[H8478]] and worms [[H8438]] cover you. [[H4374]] 
12 How [[H349]] you have fallen [[H5307]] from heaven, [[H8064]] O Morning Star, [[H1966]] son [[H1121]] of the dawn! [[H7837]] You have been cut down [[H1438]] to the ground, [[H776]] O destroyer [[H2522]] of [[H5921]] nations. [[H1471]] 
13 You [[H859]] said [[H559]] in your heart: [[H3824]] “I will ascend [[H5927]] to the heavens; [[H8064]] I will raise [[H7311]] my throne [[H3678]] above [[H4605]] the stars [[H3556]] of God. [[H410]] I will sit [[H3427]] on the mount [[H2022]] of assembly, [[H4150]] in the far reaches [[H3411]] of the north. [[H6828]] 
14 I will ascend [[H5927]] above [[H5921]] the tops [[H1116]] of the clouds; [[H5645]] I will make myself like [[H1819]] the Most High.” [[H5945]] 
15 But [[H389]] you will be brought down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] Sheol [[H7585]] to [[H413]] the far reaches [[H3411]] of the Pit. [[H953]] 
16 Those who see you [[H7200]] will stare; [[H7688]] they will ponder [[H995]] your fate: [[H413]] “Is this [[H2088]] the man [[H376]] who shook [[H7264]] the earth [[H776]] [and] made the kingdoms [[H4467]] tremble, [[H7493]] 
17 who turned [[H7760]] the world [[H8398]] into a desert [[H4057]] and destroyed [[H2040]] its cities, [[H5892]] who refused [[H3808]] to let [[H6605]] the captives [[H615]] return to their homes?” [[H1004]] 
18 All [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the nations [[H1471]] lie [[H7901]] in state, [[H3519]] each [[H376]] in his own tomb. [[H1004]] 
19 But you [[H859]] are cast out [[H7993]] of your grave [[H6913]] like a rejected [[H8581]] branch, [[H5342]] covered [[H3830]] by those slain [[H2026]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and dumped [[H3381]] into [[H413]] a rocky [[H68]] pit, [[H953]] like a carcass [[H6297]] trampled underfoot. [[H947]] 
20 You will not [[H3808]] join [[H3161]] them in burial, [[H6900]] since [[H3588]] you have destroyed [[H7843]] your land [[H776]] and slaughtered [[H2026]] your own people. [[H5971]] The offspring [[H2233]] of the wicked [[H7489]] will never again [[H3808]] be mentioned. [[H7121]] 
21 Prepare [[H3559]] a place to slaughter [[H4293]] his sons [[H1121]] for the iniquity [[H5771]] of their fathers. [[H1]] They will never [[H1077]] rise up [[H6965]] to possess [[H3423]] a land [[H776]] or cover [[H6440]] the earth [[H8398]] with their [[H4390]] cities. [[H5892]] 
22 “I will rise up [[H6965]] against them,” [[H5921]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] “I will cut off [[H3772]] from Babylon [[H894]] her name [[H8034]] and her remnant, [[H7605]] her offspring [[H5209]] and her posterity,” [[H5220]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3069]] 
23 “I will make her [[H7760]] a place [[H4180]] for owls [[H7090]] and swamplands; [[H98]] I will sweep her away [[H2894]] with the broom [[H4292]] of destruction,” [[H8045]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
24 The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has sworn: [[H7650]] “As [[H834]] I have planned, [[H1819]] so [[H3651]] will it be; [[H1961]] as [[H834]] I have purposed, [[H3289]] [so] will it stand. [[H6965]] 
25 I will break [[H7665]] Assyria [[H804]] in My land; [[H776]] I will trample him [[H947]] on [[H5921]] My mountain. [[H2022]] His yoke [[H5923]] will be taken [[H5493]] off [My people], [[H5921]] and his burden [[H5448]] removed [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] their shoulders.” [[H7926]] 
26 This [[H2063]] is the plan [[H6098]] devised [[H6095]] for [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] earth, [[H776]] and this [[H2063]] is the hand [[H3027]] stretched out [[H5186]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations. [[H1471]] 
27 The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has purposed, [[H3289]] and who [[H4310]] can thwart Him? [[H6565]] His hand [[H3027]] is outstretched, [[H5186]] so who [[H4310]] can turn it back? [[H7725]] 
28 In the year [[H8141]] that King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] died, [[H4194]] this [[H2088]] oracle [[H4853]] was received: [[H1961]] 
29 Do not [[H408]] rejoice, [[H8055]] all [[H3605]] you Philistines, [[H6429]] that [[H3588]] the rod [[H7626]] that struck you [[H5221]] is broken. [[H7665]] For [[H3588]] a viper [[H6848]] will spring [[H3318]] from the serpent’s [[H5175]] root, [[H8328]] and a flying [[H5774]] serpent [[H8314]] from its egg. [[H6529]] 
30 Then the firstborn [[H1060]] of the poor [[H1800]] will find pasture, [[H7462]] and the needy [[H34]] will lie down [[H7257]] in safety, [[H983]] but I will kill [[H4191]] your root [[H8328]] by famine, [[H7458]] and your remnant [[H7611]] will be slain. [[H2026]] 
31 Wail, [[H3213]] O gate! [[H8179]] Cry out, [[H2199]] O city! [[H5892]] Melt away, [[H4127]] all [[H3605]] you Philistines! [[H6429]] For [[H3588]] a cloud of smoke [[H6227]] comes [[H935]] from the north, [[H6828]] and there are no [[H369]] stragglers [[H909]] in its ranks. [[H4151]] 
32 What [[H4100]] answer will be given [[H6030]] to the envoys [[H4397]] of that nation? [[H1471]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has founded [[H3245]] Zion, [[H6726]] where His afflicted [[H6041]] people [[H5971]] will find refuge.” [[H2620]]
