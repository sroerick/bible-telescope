# Isaiah 28
[[Isaiah 27|←]] • [[Isaiah 29|→]]
1 Woe [[H1945]] to the majestic [[H1348]] crown [[H5850]] of Ephraim’s [[H669]] drunkards, [[H7910]] to the fading [[H5034]] flower [[H6731]] of his glorious [[H6643]] splendor, [[H8597]] set [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the summit [[H7218]] above the fertile [[H8081]] valley, [[H1516]] [the pride] of those overcome [[H1986]] by wine. [[H3196]] 
2 Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] has a strong [[H2389]] and mighty one. [[H533]] Like a hailstorm [[H1259]] or destructive [[H6986]] tempest, [[H8178]] like a driving rain [[H2230]] or flooding downpour, [[H3524]] He will smash it [[H3240]] to the ground. [[H776]] 
3 The majestic [[H1348]] crown [[H5850]] of Ephraim’s [[H669]] drunkards [[H7910]] will be trampled underfoot. [[H7429]] 
4 The fading [[H5034]] flower [[H6733]] of his beautiful [[H6643]] splendor, [[H8597]] on [[H5921]] the summit [[H7218]] above the fertile [[H8081]] valley, [[H1516]] will be [[H1961]] like a ripe fig [[H1061]] before [[H2962]] the summer harvest: [[H7019]] Whoever sees [[H7200]] it will swallow it [[H1104]] while it is still [[H5750]] in his hand. [[H3709]] 
5 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will be [[H1961]] a crown [[H5850]] of glory, [[H6643]] a diadem [[H6843]] of splendor [[H8597]] to the remnant [[H7605]] of His people, [[H5971]] 
6 a spirit [[H7307]] of justice [[H4941]] to him who sits [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] judgment, [[H4941]] and a strength [[H1369]] to those who repel [[H7725]] the onslaught [[H4421]] at the gate. [[H8179]] 
7 These [[H428]] also [[H1571]] stagger [[H7686]] from wine [[H3196]] and stumble [[H8582]] from strong drink: [[H7941]] Priests [[H3548]] and prophets [[H5030]] reel [[H7686]] from strong drink [[H7941]] and are befuddled [[H1104]] by [[H4480]] wine. [[H3196]] They stumble [[H8582]] because of [[H4480]] strong drink, [[H7941]] muddled [[H7686]] in their visions [[H7203]] and stumbling [[H6328]] in their judgments. [[H6417]] 
8 For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] their tables [[H7979]] are covered [[H4390]] with vomit; [[H6892]] there is not a place [[H4725]] without [[H1097]] filth. [[H6675]] 
9 Who is it [[H4310]] He is trying to teach? [[H3384]] To whom [[H4310]] is He explaining [[H995]] His message? [[H8052]] To infants just weaned [[H1580]] from milk? [[H2461]] To babies removed [[H6267]] from the breast? [[H7699]] 
10 For [He says], [[H3588]] “Order [[H6673]] on order, [[H6673]] order [[H6673]] on order, [[H6673]] line [[H6957]] on line, [[H6957]] line [[H6957]] on line, [[H6957]] a little [[H2191]] here, [[H8033]] a little [[H2191]] there.” [[H8033]] 
11 So [[H3588]] with stammering [[H3934]] speech [[H8193]] and a foreign [[H312]] tongue, [[H3956]] He will speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] 
12 to whom [[H834]] He has said: [[H559]] “This [[H2063]] is the place of rest, [[H4496]] let the weary [[H5889]] rest; [[H5117]] this [[H2063]] is the place of repose.” [[H4774]] But they would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] listen. [[H8085]] 
13 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will come [[H1961]] to them: [[H1992]] “Order [[H6673]] on order, [[H6673]] order [[H6673]] on order, [[H6673]] line [[H6957]] on line, [[H6957]] line [[H6957]] on line, [[H6957]] a little [[H2191]] here, [[H8033]] a little [[H2191]] there,” [[H8033]] so that [[H4616]] they will go [[H1980]] stumbling [[H3782]] backward [[H268]] and be injured, [[H7665]] snared, [[H3369]] and captured. [[H3920]] 
14 Therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] O [[H376]] scoffers, [[H3944]] who rule [[H4910]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
15 For [[H3588]] you said, [[H559]] “We have made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] death; [[H4194]] we have fashioned [[H6213]] an agreement [[H2374]] with [[H5973]] Sheol. [[H7585]] When [[H3588]] the overwhelming scourge [[H7752]] passes through, [[H5674]] it will not [[H3808]] touch us, [[H935]] because [[H3588]] we have made [[H7760]] lies [[H3577]] our refuge [[H4268]] and falsehood [[H8267]] our hiding place. [[H5641]] 
16 So [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “See, [[H2005]] I lay [[H3245]] a stone [[H68]] in Zion, [[H6726]] a tested [[H976]] stone, [[H68]] a precious [[H3368]] cornerstone, [[H6438]] a sure [[H3245]] foundation; [[H4143]] the one who believes [[H539]] will never [[H3808]] be shaken. [[H2363]] 
17 I will make [[H7760]] justice [[H4941]] the measuring line [[H6957]] and righteousness [[H6666]] the level.” [[H4949]] Hail [[H1259]] will sweep away [[H3261]] your refuge [[H4268]] of lies, [[H3577]] and water [[H4325]] will flood [[H7857]] your hiding place. [[H5643]] 
18 Your covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] death [[H4194]] will be dissolved, [[H3722]] and your agreement [[H2380]] with [[H854]] Sheol [[H7585]] will not [[H3808]] stand. [[H6965]] When [[H3588]] the overwhelming [[H7857]] scourge [[H7752]] passes through, [[H5674]] you will be [[H1961]] trampled by it. [[H4823]] 
19 As often as [[H1767]] it passes through, [[H5674]] it will carry you away; [[H3947]] it will sweep through [[H5674]] morning [[H1242]] after morning, [[H1242]] by day [[H3117]] and by night. [[H3915]] Sheer [[H7535]] terror [will come] [[H2113]] from understanding [[H995]] the message. [[H8052]] 
20 Indeed, [[H3588]] the bed [[H4702]] is too short [[H7114]] to stretch out on, [[H8311]] and the blanket [[H4541]] too small [[H6887]] to wrap around you. [[H3664]] 
21 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will rise up [[H6965]] as at Mount [[H2022]] Perazim. [[H6559]] He will rouse Himself [[H7264]] as [in] the valley [[H6010]] of Gibeon, [[H1391]] to do [[H6213]] His work, [[H4639]] His strange [[H2114]] work, [[H4639]] and to perform [[H5647]] His task, [[H5656]] His disturbing [[H5237]] task. [[H5656]] 
22 So now, [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] mock, [[H3887]] or [[H6435]] your shackles [[H4147]] will become heavier. [[H2388]] Indeed, [[H3588]] I have heard [[H8085]] from the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] a decree [[H2782]] of destruction [[H3617]] against [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] land. [[H776]] 
23 Listen [[H238]] and hear [[H8085]] my voice. [[H6963]] Pay attention [[H7181]] and hear [[H8085]] what I say. [[H565]] 
24 Does the plowman [[H2790]] plow [[H2790]] for planting [[H2232]] every [[H3605]] day? [[H3117]] Does he continuously loosen [[H6605]] and harrow [[H7702]] the soil? [[H127]] 
25 When [[H518]] he has leveled [[H7737]] its surface, [[H6440]] does he not [[H3808]] sow [[H2236]] caraway [[H7100]] and scatter [[H6327]] cumin? [[H3646]] He plants [[H7760]] wheat [[H2406]] in rows [[H7795]] and barley [[H8184]] in plots, [[H5567]] with rye [[H3698]] within its border. [[H1367]] 
26 For his God [[H430]] instructs [[H3256]] and teaches [[H3384]] him properly. [[H4941]] 
27 Surely [[H3588]] caraway [[H7100]] is not [[H3808]] threshed [[H1758]] with a sledge, [[H2742]] and the wheel [[H212]] of a cart [[H5699]] is not rolled [[H5437]] over [[H5921]] the cumin. [[H3646]] But [[H3588]] caraway [[H7100]] is beaten out [[H2251]] with a stick, [[H4294]] and cumin [[H3646]] with a rod. [[H7626]] 
28 Grain for bread [[H3899]] must be ground, [[H1854]] but [[H3588]] it is not [[H3808]] endlessly threshed. [[H1758]] Though the wheels [[H1536]] of the cart [[H5699]] roll over it, [[H2000]] the horses [[H6571]] do not [[H3808]] crush it. [[H1854]] 
29 This [[H2063]] also [[H1571]] comes [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] [who] is wonderful [[H6381]] in counsel [[H6098]] [and] excellent [[H1431]] wisdom. [[H8454]]
