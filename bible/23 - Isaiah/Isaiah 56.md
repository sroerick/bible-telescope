# Isaiah 56
[[Isaiah 55|←]] • [[Isaiah 57|→]]
1 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Maintain [[H8104]] justice [[H4941]] and do [[H6213]] what is right, [[H6666]] for [[H3588]] My salvation [[H3444]] is coming [[H935]] soon, [[H7138]] and My righteousness [[H6666]] will be revealed. [[H1540]] 
2 Blessed [[H835]] is the man [[H376]] who does [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] and the son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] who holds it fast, [[H2388]] who keeps [[H8104]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] without profaning it, [[H2490]] and keeps [[H8104]] his hand [[H3027]] from doing [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] evil.” [[H7451]] 
3 Let no [[H408]] foreigner [[H1121]] who has joined [[H3867]] himself to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] say, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] will utterly exclude [[H914]] me from [[H5921]] His people.” [[H5971]] And let the eunuch [[H5631]] not [[H408]] say, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] am but [[H2005]] a dry [[H3002]] tree.” [[H6086]] 
4 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “To the eunuchs [[H5631]] who [[H834]] keep [[H8104]] My Sabbaths, [[H7676]] who choose [[H977]] what [[H834]] pleases Me [[H2654]] and hold fast [[H2388]] to My covenant— [[H1285]] 
5 I will give them, [[H5414]] in My house [[H1004]] and within My walls, [[H2346]] a memorial [[H3027]] and a name [[H8034]] better than [[H2896]] that of sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] I will give them [[H5414]] an everlasting [[H5769]] name [[H8034]] that [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] be cut off. [[H3772]] 
6 And the foreigners [[H1121]] who join [[H3867]] themselves to [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] to minister to Him, [[H8334]] to love [[H157]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and to be [[H1961]] His servants— [[H5650]] all [[H3605]] who keep [[H8104]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] without profaning it [[H2490]] and who hold fast [[H2388]] to My covenant— [[H1285]] 
7 I will bring [[H935]] them to [[H413]] My holy [[H6944]] mountain [[H2022]] and make them joyful [[H8055]] in My house [[H1004]] of prayer. [[H8605]] Their burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sacrifices [[H2077]] will be accepted [[H7522]] on [[H5921]] My altar, [[H4196]] for [[H3588]] My house [[H1004]] will be called [[H7121]] a house [[H1004]] of prayer [[H8605]] for all [[H3605]] the nations.” [[H5971]] 
8 Thus declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] who gathers [[H6908]] the dispersed [[H1760]] of Israel: [[H3478]] “I will gather [[H6908]] to them [[H5921]] still others [[H5750]] besides those already gathered.” [[H6908]] 
9 Come, [[H857]] all [[H3605]] you beasts [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] eat greedily, [[H398]] all [[H3605]] you beasts [[H2416]] of the forest. [[H3293]] 
10 Israel’s watchmen [[H6822]] are blind, [[H5787]] they are all [[H3605]] oblivious; [[H3045]] they are all [[H3605]] mute [[H483]] dogs, [[H3611]] they cannot [[H3808]] bark; [[H5024]] they are dreamers [[H1957]] lying around, [[H7901]] loving [[H157]] to slumber. [[H5123]] 
11 Like ravenous dogs, [[H3611]] they are never [[H3808]] satisfied. [[H3045]] They [[H1992]] are shepherds [[H7462]] with [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] discernment; [[H995]] they all [[H3605]] turn [[H6437]] to their own way, [[H1870]] each [[H7097]] one [[H376]] seeking his own gain: [[H1215]] 
12 “Come, [[H857]] let me get [[H3947]] the wine, [[H3196]] let us imbibe [[H5433]] the strong drink, [[H7941]] and tomorrow [[H4279]] will be [[H1961]] like today, [[H2088]] only far [[H3966]] better!” [[H1419]]
