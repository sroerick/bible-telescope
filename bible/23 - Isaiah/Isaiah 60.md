# Isaiah 60
[[Isaiah 59|←]] • [[Isaiah 61|→]]
1 Arise, [[H6965]] shine, [[H215]] for [[H3588]] your light [[H216]] has come, [[H935]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] rises [[H2224]] upon you. [[H5921]] 
2 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] darkness [[H2822]] covers [[H3680]] the earth, [[H776]] and thick darkness [[H6205]] [is over] the peoples; [[H3816]] but the LORD [[H3068]] will rise [[H2224]] upon you, [[H5921]] and His glory [[H3519]] will appear [[H7200]] over you. [[H5921]] 
3 Nations [[H1471]] will come [[H1980]] to your light, [[H216]] and kings [[H4428]] to the brightness [[H5051]] of your dawn. [[H2225]] 
4 Lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] and look [[H7200]] around: [[H5439]] They all [[H3605]] gather [[H6908]] and come to you; [[H935]] your sons [[H1121]] will come [[H935]] from afar, [[H7350]] and your daughters [[H1323]] will be carried [[H539]] on [[H5921]] the arm. [[H6654]] 
5 Then [[H227]] you will look [[H7200]] and be radiant, [[H5102]] and your heart [[H3824]] will tremble [[H6342]] and rejoice, [[H7337]] because [[H3588]] the riches [[H1995]] of the sea [[H3220]] will be brought [[H2015]] to you, [[H5921]] and the wealth [[H2428]] of the nations [[H1471]] will come [[H935]] to you.  
6 Caravans [[H8229]] of camels [[H1581]] will cover your land, [[H3680]] young camels [[H1070]] of Midian [[H4080]] and Ephah, [[H5891]] [and] all [[H3605]] from Sheba [[H7614]] will come, [[H935]] bearing [[H5375]] gold [[H2091]] and frankincense [[H3828]] and proclaiming [[H1319]] the praises [[H8416]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 All [[H3605]] the flocks [[H6629]] of Kedar [[H6938]] will be gathered [[H6908]] to you;  the rams [[H352]] of Nebaioth [[H5032]] will serve you [[H8334]] and go up [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] My altar [[H4196]] with acceptance; [[H7522]] I will adorn [[H6286]] My glorious [[H8597]] house. [[H1004]] 
8 Who [[H4310]] are these [[H428]] who fly [[H5774]] like clouds, [[H5645]] like doves [[H3123]] to [[H413]] their shelters? [[H699]] 
9 Surely [[H3588]] the islands [[H339]] will wait [[H6960]] for Me,  with the ships [[H591]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] in the lead, [[H7223]] to bring [[H935]] your children [[H1121]] from afar, [[H7350]] with [[H854]] their silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] to the honor [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel, [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] He has bestowed glory on you. [[H6286]] 
10 Foreigners [[H1121]] will rebuild [[H1129]] your walls, [[H2346]] and their kings [[H4428]] will serve you. [[H8334]] Although [[H3588]] I struck you [[H5221]] in anger, [[H7110]] yet in favor [[H7522]] I will show you mercy. [[H7355]] 
11 Your gates [[H8179]] will always [[H8548]] stand open; [[H6605]] they will never [[H3808]] be shut, [[H5462]] day [[H3119]] or night, [[H3915]] so that the wealth [[H2428]] of the nations [[H1471]] may be brought [[H935]] into you, [[H413]] with their kings [[H4428]] being led in procession. [[H5090]] 
12 For [[H3588]] the nation [[H1471]] or kingdom [[H4467]] that [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] serve you [[H5647]] will perish; [[H6]] [it] [[H1471]] will be utterly [[H2717]] destroyed. [[H2717]] 
13 The glory [[H3519]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] will come [[H935]] to you— [[H413]] its pine, [[H1265]] fir, [[H8410]] and cypress [[H8391]] together— [[H3162]] to adorn [[H6286]] the place [[H4725]] of My sanctuary, [[H4720]] and I will glorify [[H3513]] the place [[H4725]] of My feet. [[H7272]] 
14 The sons [[H1121]] of your oppressors [[H6031]] will come [[H1980]] and bow down [[H7817]] to you; [[H413]] all [[H3605]] who reviled you [[H5006]] will fall facedown [[H7812]] at [[H5921]] your feet [[H3709]] and call [[H7121]] you  the City [[H5892]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] Zion [[H6726]] of the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
15 Whereas [[H8478]] you have been [[H1961]] forsaken [[H5805]] and despised, [[H8130]] with no [[H369]] one passing through, [[H5674]] I will make you [[H7760]] an everlasting [[H5769]] pride, [[H1347]] a joy [[H4885]] from age [[H1755]] to age. [[H1755]] 
16 You will drink [[H3243]] the milk [[H2461]] of nations [[H1471]] and nurse [[H3243]] at the breasts [[H7699]] of royalty; [[H4428]] you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] am your Savior [[H3467]] and your Redeemer, [[H1350]] the Mighty [[H46]] One of Jacob. [[H3290]] 
17 Instead of [[H8478]] bronze [[H5178]] I will bring you [[H935]] gold; [[H2091]] I will bring [[H935]] silver [[H3701]] in place of [[H8478]] iron, [[H1270]] bronze [[H5178]] instead of [[H8478]] wood, [[H6086]] and iron [[H1270]] instead of [[H8478]] stones. [[H68]] I will appoint [[H7760]] peace [[H7965]] as your governor [[H6486]] and righteousness [[H6666]] as your ruler. [[H5065]] 
18 No [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] {will} violence [[H2555]] be heard [[H8085]] in your land, [[H776]] nor ruin [[H7701]] or destruction [[H7667]] within your borders. [[H1366]] But you will name [[H7121]] your walls [[H2346]] Salvation [[H3444]] and your gates [[H8179]] Praise. [[H8416]] 
19 No [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] will the sun [[H8121]] be [[H1961]] your light [[H216]] by day, [[H3119]] and the brightness [[H5051]] of the moon [[H3394]] will not [[H3808]] shine [[H215]] on you;  for the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] your  everlasting [[H5769]] light, [[H216]] and your God [[H430]] will be your splendor. [[H8597]] 
20 Your sun [[H8121]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] set, [[H935]] and your moon [[H3391]] will not [[H3808]] wane; [[H622]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] your everlasting [[H5769]] light, [[H216]] and the days [[H3117]] of your sorrow [[H60]] will be over. [[H7999]] 
21 Then all [[H3605]] your people [[H5971]] will be righteous; [[H6662]] they will possess [[H3423]] the land forever; [[H776]] they are the branch [[H5342]] of My planting, [[H4302]] the work [[H4639]] of My hands, [[H3027]] so that I may be glorified. [[H6286]] 
22 The least [of you] [[H6996]] will become [[H1961]] a thousand, [[H505]] and the smallest [[H6810]] a mighty [[H6099]] nation. [[H1471]] I [[H589]] am the LORD; [[H3068]] in its time [[H6256]] I will accomplish it quickly. [[H2363]]
