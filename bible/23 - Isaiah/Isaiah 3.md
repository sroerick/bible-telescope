# Isaiah 3
[[Isaiah 2|←]] • [[Isaiah 4|→]]
1 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H113]] GOD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is about to remove [[H5493]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah [[H3063]] both supply [[H4937]] and support: [[H4938]] the whole [[H3605]] supply [[H4937]] of bread [[H3899]] and water, [[H4325]] 
2 the mighty man [[H1368]] and the warrior, [[H376]] the judge [[H8199]] and the prophet, [[H5030]] the soothsayer [[H7080]] and the elder, [[H2205]] 
3 the commander [[H8269]] of fifty [[H2572]] and the dignitary, [[H5375]] the counselor, [[H3289]] the cunning [[H2450]] magician, [[H2798]] and the clever [[H995]] enchanter. [[H3908]] 
4 “I will make [[H5414]] mere lads [[H5288]] their leaders, [[H8269]] and children [[H8586]] will rule [[H4910]] over them.”  
5 The people [[H5971]] will oppress one another, [[H5065]] man [[H376]] against man, [[H376]] neighbor [[H376]] against neighbor; [[H7453]] the young [[H5288]] will rise up [[H7292]] against the old, [[H2205]] and the base [[H7034]] against the honorable. [[H3513]] 
6 A man [[H376]] will seize [[H8610]] his brother [[H251]] within his father’s [[H1]] house: [[H1004]] “You have a cloak— [[H8071]] you be [[H1961]] our leader! [[H7101]] Take charge [[H3027]] of this [[H2063]] heap of rubble.” [[H4384]] 
7 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] he will cry aloud: [[H5375]] “I am [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] a healer. [[H2280]] I have no [[H369]] food [[H3899]] or clothing [[H8071]] in my house. [[H1004]] Do not [[H3808]] make me [[H7760]] leader [[H7101]] of the people!” [[H5971]] 
8 For [[H3588]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] has stumbled [[H3782]] and Judah [[H3063]] has fallen [[H5307]] because [[H3588]] they spoke [[H3956]] and acted [[H4611]] against [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] defying [[H4784]] His glorious [[H3519]] presence. [[H5869]] 
9 The expression [[H1971]] on their faces [[H6440]] testifies against them, [[H6030]] and like Sodom [[H5467]] they flaunt [[H5046]] their sin; [[H2403]] they do not [[H3808]] conceal it; [[H3582]] woe [[H188]] to them, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] they have brought [[H1580]] disaster [[H7451]] upon themselves. [[H1992]] 
10 Tell [[H559]] the righteous [[H6662]] it will be well [[H2896]] for them, [[H3588]] for they will enjoy [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of their labor. [[H4611]] 
11 Woe [[H188]] to the wicked; [[H7563]] disaster is [[H7451]] upon them! [[H3588]] For they will be repaid [[H1576]] with what their hands [[H3027]] have done. [[H6213]] 
12 Youths [[H5768]] oppress [[H5065]] My people, [[H5971]] and women [[H802]] rule [[H4910]] over them.  O My people, [[H5971]] your guides [[H833]] mislead you; [[H8582]] they turn you [[H1104]] from your paths. [[H734]] 
13 The LORD [[H3068]] arises [[H5324]] to contend; [[H7378]] He stands [[H5975]] to judge [[H1777]] the people. [[H5971]] 
14 The LORD [[H3068]] brings [[H935]] this charge [[H4941]] against [[H5973]] the elders [[H2205]] and leaders [[H8269]] of His people: [[H5971]] “You [[H859]] have devoured [[H1197]] the vineyard; [[H3754]] the plunder [[H1500]] of the poor [[H6041]] is in your houses. [[H1004]] 
15 Why [[H4480]] do you crush [[H1792]] My people [[H5971]] and grind [[H2912]] the faces [[H6440]] of the poor?” [[H6041]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
16 The LORD [[H3069]] says, [[H559]] “Because [[H3282]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] are haughty— [[H1361]] walking [[H1980]] with heads [[H1627]] held high [[H5186]] and wanton [[H8265]] eyes, [[H5869]] prancing [[H1980]] and skipping [[H2952]] as they go, [[H1980]] jingling [[H5913]] the bracelets on their ankles— [[H7272]] 
17 the Lord [[H136]] will bring sores [[H5596]] on the heads [[H6936]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] and the LORD [[H3068]] will make their foreheads [[H6596]] bare. [[H6168]] 
18 In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H136]] will take away [[H5493]] the finery [[H8597]] of [their] anklets [[H5914]] and headbands [[H7636]] and crescents, [[H7720]] 
19 [their] pendants, [[H5188]] bracelets, [[H8285]] and veils, [[H7479]] 
20 [their] headdresses, [[H6287]] ankle chains, [[H6807]] and sashes, [[H7196]] [their] perfume [[H5315]] bottles [[H1004]] and charms; [[H3908]] 
21 [their] signet rings [[H2885]] and nose [[H639]] rings, [[H5141]] 
22 [their] festive robes, [[H4254]] capes, [[H4595]] cloaks, [[H4304]] and purses, [[H2754]] 
23 and [their] mirrors, [[H1549]] linen garments, [[H5466]] tiaras, [[H6797]] and shawls. [[H7289]] 
24 Instead of [[H8478]] fragrance [[H1314]] there will be [[H1961]] a stench; [[H4716]] instead of [[H8478]] a belt, [[H2290]] a rope; [[H5364]] instead of [[H8478]] styled [[H4639]] hair, [[H4748]] baldness; [[H7144]] instead of [[H8478]] fine clothes, [[H6614]] sackcloth; [[H4228]] instead of [[H8478]] beauty, [[H3308]] branding. [[H3587]] 
25 Your men [[H4962]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and your warriors [[H1369]] in battle. [[H4421]] 
26 And the gates [of Zion] [[H6607]] will lament [[H578]] and mourn; [[H56]] destitute, [[H5352]] she will sit [[H3427]] on the ground. [[H776]]
