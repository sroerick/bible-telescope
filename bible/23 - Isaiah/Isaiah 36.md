# Isaiah 36
[[Isaiah 35|←]] • [[Isaiah 37|→]]
1 In the fourteenth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Hezekiah, [[H2396]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] attacked [[H5927]] and captured [[H8610]] all [[H3605]] the fortified [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
2 And the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] sent [[H7971]] [the] Rab-shakeh, [[H7262]] with a great [[H3515]] army, [[H2426]] from Lachish [[H3923]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] at Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And he stopped [[H5975]] by the aqueduct [[H8585]] of the upper [[H5945]] pool, [[H1295]] on the road [[H4546]] to the Launderer’s [[H3526]] Field. [[H7704]] 
3 Then Eliakim [[H471]] son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah [[H2518]] the palace [[H1004]] administrator, [[H5921]] Shebna [[H7644]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Joah [[H3098]] son [[H1121]] of Asaph [[H623]] the recorder, [[H2142]] went out [[H3318]] to him. [[H413]] 
4 The Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Tell [[H559]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] that this is what [[H3541]] the great [[H1419]] king, [[H4428]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] says: [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] is the basis [[H982]] [of] this [[H2088]] confidence [[H986]] of yours? [[H834]] 
5 You claim [[H559]] [to have] a strategy [[H6098]] and strength [[H1369]] for war, [[H4421]] but [[H389]] [these are] empty [[H1697]] words. [[H8193]] On [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] are you now [[H6258]] relying, [[H982]] that [[H3588]] you have rebelled [[H4775]] against me?  
6 Look now, [[H2009]] you are trusting [[H982]] in [[H5921]] Egypt, [[H4714]] that [[H2088]] splintered [[H7533]] reed [[H7070]] of a staff [[H4938]] that [[H834]] will pierce [[H5344]] the hand [[H3709]] of anyone [[H376]] who leans [[H5564]] on it. [[H5921]] Such is [[H3651]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to all [[H3605]] who trust [[H982]] in him. [[H5921]] 
7 But if [[H3588]] you say [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “We trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the LORD [[H3069]] our God,” [[H430]] is He [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] the One [[H834]] whose high places [[H1116]] and altars [[H4196]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] has removed, [[H5493]] saying [[H559]] to Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] “You must worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] altar”? [[H4196]] 
8 Now therefore, [[H6258]] make a bargain [[H6148]] with [[H854]] my master, [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] I will give [[H5414]] you  two thousand [[H505]] horses— [[H5483]] if [[H518]] you can [[H3201]] put [[H5414]] riders [[H7392]] on them! [[H5921]] 
9 For how [[H349]] can you repel [[H7725]] a single [[H259]] officer [[H6346]] among the weakest [[H6996]] of my master’s [[H113]] servants [[H5650]] when you depend [[H982]] on [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4714]] for chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen? [[H6571]] 
10 So now, [[H6258]] was it apart from [[H1107]] the LORD [[H3068]] that I have come up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to destroy it? [[H7843]] The LORD Himself [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘Go up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] and destroy it.’” [[H7843]] 
11 Then Eliakim, [[H471]] Shebna, [[H7644]] and Joah [[H3098]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Rab-shakeh, [[H7262]] “Please [[H4994]] speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] your servants [[H5650]] in Aramaic, [[H762]] since [[H3588]] we [[H587]] understand it. [[H8085]] Do not [[H408]] speak [[H1696]] to us [[H413]] in Hebrew [[H3066]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the people [[H5971]] on [[H5921]] the wall. [[H2346]] 
12 But the Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] replied, [[H559]] “Has my master [[H113]] sent [[H7971]] me to speak [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] only to [[H413]] you and [[H413]] your master, [[H113]] and not [[H3808]] to [[H5921]] the men [[H376]] sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] who are destined with you [[H5973]] to eat [[H398]] their own dung [[H2716]] and drink [[H8354]] their own urine? [[H7890]] 
13 Then the Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] stood [[H5975]] and called out [[H7121]] loudly [[H6963]] in Hebrew: [[H3066]] “Hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the great [[H1419]] king, [[H4428]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria! [[H804]] 
14 This is what [[H3541]] the king [[H4428]] says: [[H559]] Do not [[H408]] let Hezekiah [[H2396]] deceive you, [[H5377]] for [[H3588]] he cannot [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] you. [[H853]] 
15 Do not [[H408]] let Hezekiah [[H2396]] persuade you to trust [[H982]] in the LORD [[H3068]] when he says, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] will surely deliver [[H5337]] us; [[H5337]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will not [[H3808]] be given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria.’ [[H804]] 
16 Do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] for [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] says: [[H559]] Make [[H6213]] peace [[H1293]] with me [[H854]] and come out [[H3318]] to me. [[H413]] Then every one of you [[H376]] will eat [[H398]] from his own vine [[H1612]] and [[H376]] his own fig tree, [[H8384]] and drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] from his own cistern, [[H953]] 
17 until [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] and take you away [[H3947]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] like your own— [[H776]] a land [[H776]] of grain [[H1715]] and new wine, [[H8492]] a land [[H776]] of bread [[H3899]] and vineyards. [[H3754]] 
18 Do not let [[H6435]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] mislead [[H5496]] you when he says, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] will deliver us.’ [[H5337]] Has the god [[H430]] of any [[H376]] nation [[H1471]] ever delivered [[H5337]] his land [[H776]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria? [[H804]] 
19 Where [[H346]] are the gods [[H430]] of Hamath [[H2574]] and Arpad? [[H774]] Where [[H346]] are the gods [[H430]] of Sepharvaim? [[H5617]] Have they delivered [[H5337]] Samaria [[H8111]] from my hand? [[H3027]] 
20 Who [[H4310]] among all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of these [[H428]] lands [[H776]] has delivered [[H5337]] his land [[H776]] from my hand? [[H3027]] How then [[H3588]] can the LORD [[H3068]] deliver [[H5337]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] from my hand?” [[H3027]] 
21 But [the people] remained silent [[H2790]] and did not [[H3808]] answer a word, [[H6030]] for [[H3588]] [Hezekiah] [[H4428]] had commanded, [[H4687]] “Do not [[H3808]] answer him.” [[H6030]] 
22 Then Hilkiah’s [[H2518]] son [[H1121]] Eliakim [[H471]] the palace [[H1004]] administrator, [[H5921]] Shebna [[H7644]] the court secretary, [[H5608]] and Asaph’s [[H623]] son [[H1121]] Joah [[H3098]] the court historian, [[H2142]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] with their clothes [[H899]] torn, [[H7167]] and they relayed [[H5046]] to him  the words [[H1697]] of  [the] Rab-shakeh. [[H7262]]
