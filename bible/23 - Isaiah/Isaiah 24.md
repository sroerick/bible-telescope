# Isaiah 24
[[Isaiah 23|←]] • [[Isaiah 25|→]]
1 Behold, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] lays waste [[H1238]] to the earth [[H776]] and leaves it in ruins. [[H1110]] He will twist [[H5753]] its surface [[H6440]] and scatter [[H6327]] its inhabitants— [[H3427]] 
2 people [[H5971]] and priest alike, [[H3548]] servant [[H5650]] and master, [[H113]] maid [[H8198]] and mistress, [[H1404]] buyer [[H7069]] and seller, [[H4376]] lender [[H3867]] and borrower, [[H3867]] creditor [[H5378]] and debtor.  
3 The earth [[H776]] will be utterly [[H1238]] laid waste [[H1238]] and thoroughly [[H962]] plundered, [[H962]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] word. [[H1697]] 
4 The earth [[H776]] mourns [[H56]] and withers; [[H5034]] the world [[H8398]] languishes [[H535]] and fades; [[H5034]] the exalted [[H4791]] of the earth [[H776]] waste away. [[H535]] 
5 The earth [[H776]] is defiled [[H2610]] by [[H8478]] its people; [[H3427]] they have transgressed [[H5674]] the laws; [[H8451]] they have overstepped [[H2498]] the decrees [[H2706]] and broken [[H6565]] the everlasting [[H5769]] covenant. [[H1285]] 
6 Therefore [[H5921]] a curse [[H423]] has consumed [[H398]] the earth, [[H776]] and its inhabitants [[H3427]] must bear the guilt; [[H816]] the earth’s [[H776]] dwellers [[H3427]] have been burned, [[H2787]] and only a few [[H582]] survive. [[H7604]] 
7 The new wine [[H8492]] dries up; [[H56]] the vine [[H1612]] withers. [[H535]] All [[H3605]] the merrymakers [[H8056]] now groan. [[H584]] 
8 The joyful [[H4885]] tambourines [[H8596]] have ceased; [[H7673]] the noise [[H7588]] of revelers [[H5947]] has stopped; [[H2308]] the joyful [[H4885]] harp [[H3658]] is silent. [[H7673]] 
9 They no [[H3808]] longer sing [[H7892]] and drink [[H8354]] wine; [[H3196]] strong drink [[H7941]] is bitter [[H4843]] to those who consume it. [[H8354]] 
10 The city [[H7151]] of chaos [[H8414]] is shattered; [[H7665]] every [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] is closed [[H5462]] to entry. [[H935]] 
11 In the streets [[H2351]] they cry out [[H6682]] for [[H5921]] wine. [[H3196]] All [[H3605]] joy [[H8057]] turns to gloom; [[H6150]] rejoicing [[H4885]] is exiled [[H1540]] from the land. [[H776]] 
12 The city [[H5892]] is left [[H7604]] in ruins; [[H8047]] its gate [[H8179]] is reduced [[H3807]] to rubble. [[H7591]] 
13 So [[H3588]] will it be [[H1961]] on [[H7130]] the earth [[H776]] [and] among [[H8432]] the nations: [[H5971]] like a harvested [[H5363]] olive tree, [[H2132]] like a gleaning [[H5955]] after [[H518]] a grape harvest. [[H1210]] 
14 They [[H1992]] raise [[H5375]] their voices, [[H6963]] they shout for joy; [[H7442]] from the west [[H3220]] they proclaim [[H6670]] the majesty [[H1347]] of the LORD. [[H3069]] 
15 Therefore [[H5921]] glorify [[H3513]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the east. [[H217]] Extol the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] in the islands [[H339]] of the sea. [[H3220]] 
16 From the ends [[H3671]] of the earth [[H776]] we hear [[H8085]] singing: [[H2158]] “Glory [[H6643]] to the Righteous One.” [[H6662]] But I said, [[H559]] “I am wasting away! [[H7334]] I am wasting away! [[H7334]] Woe is me.” [[H188]] The treacherous [[H898]] betray; [[H898]] the treacherous [[H898]] deal in [[H899]] treachery. [[H898]] 
17 Terror [[H6343]] and pit [[H6354]] and snare [[H6341]] await you, [[H5921]] O dwellers [[H3427]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
18 Whoever flees [[H5127]] the sound [[H6963]] of terror [[H6343]] will fall [[H5307]] into [[H413]] a pit, [[H6354]] and whoever escapes [[H5927]] from [[H8432]] the pit [[H6354]] will be caught [[H3920]] in a trap. [[H6341]] For [[H3588]] the windows [[H699]] of heaven [[H4791]] are open, [[H6605]] and the foundations [[H4146]] of the earth [[H776]] are shaken. [[H7493]] 
19 The earth [[H776]] is utterly [[H7489]] broken apart, [[H7489]] the earth [[H776]] is split open, [[H6565]] the earth [[H776]] is shaken [[H4131]] violently. [[H4131]] 
20 The earth [[H776]] staggers [[H5128]] like a drunkard [[H7910]] and sways [[H5110]] like a shack. [[H4412]] Earth’s rebellion [[H6588]] weighs it down, [[H3513]] and it falls, [[H5307]] never [[H3808]] to rise [[H6965]] again. [[H3254]] 
21 In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] will punish [[H6485]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H4791]] above [[H4791]] and the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H127]] below. [[H5921]] 
22 They will be gathered [[H622]] together [[H626]] like prisoners [[H616]] in [[H5921]] a pit. [[H953]] They will be confined [[H5462]] to [[H5921]] a dungeon [[H4525]] and punished [[H6485]] after [[H7230]] many days. [[H3117]] 
23 The moon [[H3842]] will be confounded [[H2659]] and the sun [[H2535]] ashamed; [[H954]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will reign [[H4427]] on Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and in the presence of [[H5048]] His elders, [[H2205]] He will display His glory.
