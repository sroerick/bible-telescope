# Isaiah 41
[[Isaiah 40|←]] • [[Isaiah 42|→]]
1 “Be silent [[H2790]] before Me, [[H413]] O islands, [[H339]] and let the peoples [[H3816]] renew [[H2498]] their strength. [[H3581]] Let them come forward [[H5066]] and [[H227]] testify; [[H1696]] let us together [[H3162]] draw near [[H7126]] for judgment. [[H4941]] 
2 Who [[H4310]] has aroused [[H5782]] the one from the east [[H4217]] [and] called him [[H7121]] to his feet [[H7272]] in righteousness? [[H6664]] He hands nations [[H1471]] over [[H5414]] to him [[H6440]] [and] subdues [[H7287]] kings [before him]. [[H4428]] He turns [[H5414]] them to dust [[H6083]] with his sword, [[H2719]] to windblown [[H5086]] chaff [[H7179]] with his bow. [[H7198]] 
3 He pursues them, [[H7291]] going on [[H5674]] safely, [[H7965]] hardly [[H3808]] touching [[H935]] the path [[H734]] with his feet. [[H7272]] 
4 Who [[H4310]] has performed this [[H6466]] and carried it out, [[H6213]] calling forth [[H7121]] the generations [[H1755]] from the beginning? [[H7218]] I, [[H589]] the LORD— [[H3068]] the first [[H7223]] and [[H853]] the last— [[H314]] I [[H589]] am He.” [[H1931]] 
5 The islands [[H339]] see [[H7200]] and fear, [[H3372]] the ends [[H7098]] of the earth [[H776]] tremble. [[H2729]] They approach [[H7126]] and come forward. [[H857]] 
6 Each one [[H376]] helps [[H5826]] the other, [[H7453]] and says [[H559]] to his brother, [[H251]] “Be strong!” [[H2388]] 
7 The craftsman [[H2796]] encourages [[H2388]] the goldsmith, [[H6884]] [and] he who wields [[H2505]] the hammer [[H6360]] [cheers] him who strikes [[H1986]] the anvil, [[H6471]] saying [[H559]] of the soldering, [[H1694]] “It [[H1931]] is good.” [[H2896]] He nails it down [[H2388]] so it will not [[H3808]] be toppled. [[H4131]] 
8 But you, [[H859]] O Israel, [[H3478]] My servant, [[H5650]] Jacob, [[H3290]] whom [[H834]] I have chosen, [[H977]] descendant [[H2233]] of Abraham [[H85]] My friend— [[H157]] 
9 I brought [[H2388]] you from [[H834]] the ends [[H7098]] of the earth [[H776]] and called you [[H7121]] from its farthest corners. [[H678]] I said, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] are My servant.” [[H5650]] I have chosen [[H977]] and not [[H3808]] rejected you. [[H3988]] 
10 Do not [[H408]] fear, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am with you; [[H5973]] do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H8159]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am your God. [[H430]] I will strengthen you; [[H553]] I will surely help you; [[H5826]] I will uphold you [[H8551]] with My right hand [[H3225]] of righteousness. [[H6664]] 
11 Behold, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] who rage against you [[H2734]] will be ashamed [[H954]] and disgraced; [[H3637]] those who contend [[H376]] with you [[H7379]] will be [[H1961]] reduced to nothing [[H369]] and will perish. [[H6]] 
12 You will seek [[H1245]] [them] [[H376]] but will not [[H3808]] find them. [[H4672]] Those who wage war [[H4421]] against you [[H376]] will come [[H1961]] to nothing. [[H369]] 
13 For [[H3588]] I am [[H589]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God, [[H430]] who takes hold [[H2388]] of your right hand [[H3225]] and says to you: [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] fear, [[H3372]] I [[H589]] will help [[H5826]] you.”  
14 Do not [[H408]] fear, [[H3372]] O worm [[H8438]] Jacob, [[H3290]] O few men [[H4962]] of Israel. [[H3478]] I [[H589]] will help you, [[H5826]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Your Redeemer [[H1350]] is the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel. [[H3478]] 
15 Behold, [[H2009]] I will make you [[H7760]] into a threshing sledge, [[H4173]] new [[H2319]] [and] sharp, [[H2742]] with [[H1167]] many teeth. [[H6374]] You will thresh [[H1758]] the mountains [[H2022]] and crush them, [[H1854]] and reduce [[H7760]] the hills [[H1389]] to chaff. [[H4671]] 
16 You will winnow them, [[H2219]] and a wind [[H7307]] will carry them away; [[H5375]] a gale [[H5591]] will scatter [[H6327]] them. [[H853]] But you [[H859]] will rejoice [[H1523]] in the LORD; [[H3068]] you will glory [[H1984]] in the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel. [[H3478]] 
17 The poor [[H6041]] and needy [[H34]] seek [[H1245]] water, [[H4325]] but there is none; [[H369]] their tongues [[H3956]] are parched [[H5405]] with thirst. [[H6772]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] will answer them; [[H6030]] I, the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] will not [[H3808]] forsake them. [[H5800]] 
18 I will open [[H6605]] rivers [[H5104]] on [[H5921]] the barren heights, [[H8205]] and fountains [[H4599]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the valleys. [[H1237]] I will turn [[H7760]] the desert [[H4057]] into a pool [[H98]] of water, [[H4325]] and the dry [[H6723]] land [[H776]] into flowing springs. [[H4161]] 
19 I will plant [[H5414]] cedars [[H730]] in the desert, [[H4057]] acacias, [[H7848]] myrtles, [[H1918]] and olive [[H8081]] trees. [[H6086]] I will set [[H7760]] evergreens [[H1265]] in the desert, [[H6160]] elms [[H8410]] and cypress trees [[H8391]] together, [[H3162]] 
20 so that [[H4616]] all [[H3162]] may see [[H7200]] and know, [[H3045]] may consider [[H7760]] and understand, [[H7919]] that [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has done [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel [[H3478]] has created it. [[H1254]] 
21 “Present [[H7126]] your case,” [[H7379]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Submit [[H5066]] your arguments,” [[H6110]] says [[H559]] the King [[H4428]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] 
22 “Let them come [[H5066]] and tell [[H5046]] us  what [[H834]] will happen. [[H7136]] Tell [[H5046]] the former things, [[H7223]] so that we may reflect on [[H7760]] them [[H3820]] and know [[H3045]] the outcome. [[H319]] Or [[H176]] announce to us [[H8085]] what is coming. [[H935]] 
23 Tell us [[H5046]] the things [[H857]] that are to come, [[H268]] so that we may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are gods. [[H430]] Yes, [[H637]] do something good [[H3190]] or evil, [[H7489]] that we may look on together in dismay. [[H8159]] 
24 Behold, [[H2005]] you [[H859]] are nothing [[H369]] and your work [[H6467]] is of no value. [[H659]] Anyone who chooses [[H977]] you is detestable. [[H8441]] 
25 “I have raised up [[H5782]] [one] from the north, [[H6828]] and he has come— [[H857]] one from the east [[H4217]] who calls on [[H7121]] My name. [[H8034]] He will march over [[H935]] rulers [[H5461]] as if [[H3644]] they were mortar, [[H2563]] like [[H3644]] a potter [[H3335]] who treads [[H7429]] the clay. [[H2916]] 
26 Who [[H4310]] has declared [this] [[H5046]] from the beginning, [[H7218]] so that we may know, [[H3045]] and from times past, [[H6440]] so that we may say: [[H559]] ‘He was right’? [[H6662]] No [[H369]] one announced it, [[H5046]] no one [[H369]] foretold it, [[H8085]] no [[H369]] one heard [[H8085]] your words. [[H561]] 
27 I was the first to tell [[H7223]] Zion: [[H6726]] ‘Look, [[H2009]] here they are!’ [[H2005]] And I gave [[H5414]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] a herald of good news. [[H1319]] 
28 When I look, [[H7200]] there is no [[H369]] one; [[H376]] there is no [[H369]] counselor [[H3289]] among them; [[H428]] when I ask them, [[H7592]] they have nothing to say. [[H7725]] 
29 See, [[H2005]] [they are] all [[H3605]] a delusion; [[H205]] their works [[H4639]] amount to nothing; [[H657]] their images [[H5262]] are as empty [[H8414]] as the wind. [[H7307]]
