# Isaiah 49
[[Isaiah 48|←]] • [[Isaiah 50|→]]
1 Listen [[H8085]] to me, [[H413]] O islands, [[H339]] and pay attention, [[H7181]] O distant [[H7350]] peoples: [[H3816]] The LORD [[H3068]] called me [[H7121]] from the womb; [[H990]] from the body [[H4578]] of my mother [[H517]] He named me. [[H2142]] 
2 He made [[H7760]] my mouth [[H6310]] like a sharp [[H2299]] sword; [[H2719]] He hid me [[H2244]] in the shadow [[H6738]] of His hand. [[H3027]] He made me [[H7760]] like a polished [[H1305]] arrow; [[H2671]] He hid [[H5641]] me in His quiver. [[H827]] 
3 He said [[H559]] to me,  “You [[H859]] are My servant, [[H5650]] Israel, [[H3478]] in whom [[H834]] I will display My glory.” [[H6286]] 
4 But I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] “I have labored [[H3021]] in vain, [[H7385]] I have spent [[H3615]] my strength [[H3581]] in futility [[H8414]] and vanity; [[H1892]] yet [[H403]] my vindication [[H4941]] is with [[H854]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and my reward [[H6468]] is with [[H854]] my God.” [[H430]] 
5 And now [[H6258]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3069]] who formed me [[H3335]] from the womb [[H990]] to be His Servant, [[H5650]] to bring Jacob [[H3290]] back [[H7725]] to Him, [[H413]] that Israel [[H3478]] might be gathered to Him— [[H622]] for I am honored [[H3513]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] and my God [[H430]] is [[H1961]] my strength— [[H5797]] 
6 He says, [[H559]] “It is not enough [[H7043]] for you to be [[H1961]] My Servant, [[H5650]] to raise up [[H6965]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and to restore [[H7725]] the protected [[H5336]] ones of Israel. [[H3478]] I will also make [[H5414]] you a light [[H216]] for the nations, [[H1471]] that you may bring [[H1961]] My salvation [[H3444]] to [[H5704]] the ends [[H7097]] of the earth.” [[H776]] 
7 Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the Redeemer [[H1350]] [and] Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to him who [[H5315]] was despised [[H960]] [and] abhorred [[H8581]] by the nation, [[H1471]] to the servant [[H5650]] of rulers: [[H4910]] “Kings [[H4428]] will see you [[H7200]] and rise, [[H6965]] and princes [[H8269]] will bow down, [[H7812]] because of [[H4616]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] is faithful, [[H539]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel, [[H3478]] who has chosen you. [[H977]] 
8 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “In the time [[H6256]] of favor [[H7522]] I will answer you, [[H6030]] and in the day [[H3117]] of salvation [[H3444]] I will help you; [[H5826]] I will keep you [[H5341]] and appoint you [[H5414]] to be a covenant [[H1285]] for the people, [[H5971]] to restore [[H6965]] the land, [[H776]] to apportion [[H5157]] its desolate [[H8074]] inheritances, [[H5159]] 
9 to say [[H559]] to the prisoners, [[H631]] ‘Come out,’ [[H3318]] and to those [[H834]] in darkness, [[H2822]] ‘Show yourselves.’ [[H1540]] They will feed [[H7462]] along [[H5921]] the pathways, [[H1870]] and find pasture [[H4830]] on every [[H3605]] barren hill. [[H8205]] 
10 They will not [[H3808]] hunger [[H7456]] or thirst, [[H6770]] nor will [[H3808]] the scorching heat [[H8273]] or sun [[H8121]] strike them. [[H5221]] For [[H3588]] He who has compassion on them [[H7355]] will guide them [[H5090]] and lead them [[H5095]] beside [[H5921]] springs [[H4002]] of water. [[H4325]] 
11 I will turn [[H7760]] all [[H3605]] My mountains [[H2022]] into roads, [[H1870]] and My highways [[H4546]] will be raised up. [[H7311]] 
12 Behold, [[H2009]] they [[H428]] will come [[H935]] from far away, [[H7350]] from the north [[H6828]] and from the west, [[H3220]] and from [[H428]] the land [[H776]] of Aswan.” [[H5515]] 
13 Shout for joy, [[H7442]] O heavens; [[H8064]] rejoice, [[H1523]] O earth; [[H776]] break [[H6476]] into joyful song, [[H7440]] O mountains! [[H2022]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has comforted [[H5162]] His people, [[H5971]] and He will have compassion [[H7355]] on His afflicted ones. [[H6041]] 
14 But Zion [[H6726]] said, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has forsaken me; [[H5800]] the Lord [[H136]] has forgotten me!” [[H7911]] 
15 “Can a woman [[H802]] forget [[H7911]] her nursing child, [[H5764]] or lack compassion [[H7355]] for the son [[H1121]] of her womb? [[H990]] Though [[H1571]] she [[H428]] may forget, [[H7911]] I will [[H595]] not [[H3808]] forget you! [[H7911]] 
16 Behold, [[H2005]] I have inscribed you [[H2710]] on [[H5921]] the palms of My hands; [[H3709]] your walls [[H2346]] are ever [[H8548]] before Me. [[H5048]] 
17 Your builders [[H1121]] hasten back; [[H4116]] those who laid you waste [[H2040]] will depart. [[H3318]] 
18 Lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] and look [[H7200]] around. [[H5439]] They all [[H3605]] gather together; [[H6908]] they come [[H935]] to you.  As surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] you will wear [[H3847]] them all [[H3605]] as jewelry [[H5716]] and put them on [[H7194]] like a bride. [[H3618]] 
19 For [[H3588]] your ruined [[H2723]] and desolate places [[H8074]] and your ravaged land [[H776]] will now [[H6258]] indeed [[H3588]] be too small [[H3334]] for your people, [[H3427]] and those who devoured you [[H1104]] will be far away. [[H7368]] 
20 Yet [[H5750]] the children [[H1121]] of your bereavement [[H7923]] will say [[H559]] in your hearing, [[H241]] ‘This place [[H4725]] is too small for us; [[H6862]] make room [[H5066]] for us to live here.’ [[H3427]] 
21 Then you will say [[H559]] in your heart, [[H3824]] ‘Who [[H4310]] has begotten [[H3205]] these for me? [[H428]] I [[H589]] was bereaved [[H7921]] and barren; [[H1565]] I was exiled [[H1473]] and rejected. [[H5493]] So who [[H4310]] has reared them? [[H1431]] Look, [[H2005]] I [[H589]] was left [[H7604]] all alone, [[H905]] so [[H428]] where [[H375]] did they come from?’” [[H1992]] 
22 This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I will lift up [[H5375]] My hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] the nations, [[H1471]] and raise [[H7311]] My banner [[H5251]] to [[H413]] the peoples. [[H5971]] They will bring [[H935]] your sons [[H1121]] in their arms [[H2684]] and carry [[H5375]] your daughters [[H1323]] on [[H5921]] their shoulders. [[H3802]] 
23 Kings [[H4428]] will be [[H1961]] your foster fathers, [[H539]] and their queens [[H8282]] your nursing mothers. [[H3243]] They will bow to you [[H7812]] facedown [[H639]] and lick [[H3897]] the dust [[H6083]] at your feet. [[H7272]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD; [[H3068]] those who [[H834]] hope in Me [[H6960]] will never [[H3808]] be put to shame.” [[H954]] 
24 Can the plunder [[H4455]] be snatched [[H3947]] from the mighty, [[H1368]] or [[H518]] the captives [[H7628]] of a tyrant [[H6662]] be delivered? [[H4422]] 
25 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Even [[H1571]] the captives [[H7628]] of the mighty [[H1368]] will be taken away, [[H3947]] and the plunder [[H4455]] of a tyrant [[H6184]] will be retrieved; [[H4422]] I [[H595]] will contend [[H7378]] with [[H854]] those who contend with you, [[H3401]] and I [[H595]] will save [[H3467]] your children. [[H1121]] 
26 I will make your oppressors [[H3238]] eat [[H398]] their own flesh, [[H1320]] and they will be drunk [[H7937]] on their own blood, [[H1818]] as with sweet wine. [[H6071]] Then all [[H3605]] mankind [[H1320]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] am your Savior [[H3467]] and your Redeemer, [[H1350]] the Mighty [[H46]] One of Jacob.” [[H3290]]
