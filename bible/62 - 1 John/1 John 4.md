1 Beloved, [[G27]] do not believe [[G4100]] every [[G3956]] spirit, [[G4151]] but [[G235]] test [[G1381]] the [[G3588]] spirits [[G4151]] [to see] whether [[G1487]] they are [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]] For [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] false prophets [[G5578]] have gone out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] 
2 By [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] you will know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of God: [[G2316]] Every [[G3956]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G3739]] confesses [that] [[G3670]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] has come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [the] flesh [[G4561]] is [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] 
3 and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G3739]] does not confess [[G3670]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] from [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]] This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [spirit] [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] antichrist, [[G500]] which [[G3739]] you have heard [[G191]] is coming, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] is [[G1510]] already [[G2235]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] at this time. [[G3568]] 
4 You, [[G4771]] little children, [[G5040]] are [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] have overcome [[G3528]] them, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] greater [[G3173]] is [[G1510]] He who [is] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] than [[G2228]] he who [is] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] 
5 They [[G846]] are [[G1510]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] That is why [[G1223]] they speak [[G2980]] from the [[G3588]] world’s [[G2889]] perspective, [[G1537]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] listens to [[G191]] them. [[G846]] 
6 We [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]] Whoever [[G3588]] knows [[G1097]] God [[G2316]] listens to [[G191]] us; [[G1473]] whoever [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] from [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] does not listen to [[G191]] us. [[G1473]] That is how [[G1537]] we know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of truth [[G225]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of deception. [[G4106]] 
7 Beloved, [[G27]] let us love [[G25]] one another, [[G240]] because [[G3754]] love [[G26]] comes [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]] Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] loves [[G25]] has been born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] knows [[G1097]] God. [[G2316]] 
8 Whoever [[G3588]] does not love [[G25]] does not know [[G1097]] God, [[G2316]] because [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] love. [[G26]] 
9 This is how [[G1722]] God’s [[G2316]] love [[G26]] was revealed [[G5319]] among [[G1722]] us: [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] sent [[G649]] His [[G846]] one and only [[G3439]] Son [[G5207]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] so that [[G2443]] we might live [[G2198]] through [[G1223]] Him. [[G846]] 
10 [And] love [[G26]] consists [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] this: [[G3778]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] we [[G1473]] loved [[G25]] God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] that [[G3754]] He [[G846]] loved [[G25]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] His [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] [as an] atoning sacrifice [[G2434]] for [[G4012]] our [[G1473]] sins. [[G266]] 
11 Beloved, [[G27]] if [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] so [[G3779]] loved [[G25]] us, [[G1473]] we [[G1473]] also [[G2532]] ought [[G3784]] to love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]] 
12 No one [[G3762]] has ever seen [[G2300]] God; [[G2316]] [but] if [[G1437]] we love [[G25]] one another, [[G240]] God [[G2316]] remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] love [[G26]] is [[G1510]] perfected [[G5048]] in [[G1722]] us. [[G1473]] 
13 By [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He [[G846]] in [[G1722]] us: [[G1473]] He has given [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] of [[G1537]] His [[G846]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
14 And [[G2532]] we [[G1473]] have seen [[G2300]] and [[G2532]] testify [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has sent [[G649]] [His] [[G3588]] Son [to be] [[G5207]] [the] Savior [[G4990]] of the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] 
15 If [[G1437]] anyone [[G3739]] confesses [[G3670]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] abides [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] in [[G1722]] God. [[G2316]] 
16 And [[G2532]] we [[G1473]] have come to know [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] believe [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] that [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has [[G2192]] for [[G1722]] us. [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] love; [[G26]] whoever [[G3588]] abides [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] love [[G26]] abides [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]] 
17 In [[G1722]] this [way], [[G3778]] love [[G26]] has been perfected [[G5048]] among [[G3326]] us, [[G1473]] so that [[G2443]] we may have [[G2192]] confidence [[G3954]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of judgment; [[G2920]] for [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] world [[G2889]] we [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] just like [[G2531]] Him. [[G1565]] 
18 There is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] fear [[G5401]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] but [[G235]] perfect [[G5046]] love [[G26]] drives [[G906]] out [[G1854]] fear, [[G5401]] because [[G3754]] fear [[G5401]] involves [[G2192]] punishment. [[G2851]] The [one who] [[G3588]] fears [[G5399]] has not been perfected [[G5048]] in [[G1722]] love. [[G26]] 
19 We [[G1473]] love [[G25]] because [[G3754]] He [[G846]] first [[G4413]] loved [[G25]] us. [[G1473]] 
20 If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] says, [[G2036]] “I love [[G25]] God,” [[G2316]] [but] [[G2532]] hates [[G3404]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] he is [[G1510]] a liar. [[G5583]] For [[G1063]] anyone who [[G3588]] does not love [[G25]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] whom [[G3739]] he has seen, [[G3708]] cannot [[G1410]] love [[G25]] God, [[G2316]] whom [[G3739]] he has not seen. [[G3708]] 
21 And [[G2532]] we have [[G2192]] this [[G3778]] commandment [[G1785]] from [[G575]] Him: [[G846]] Whoever [[G3588]] loves [[G25]] God [[G2316]] must love [[G25]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] as well. [[G2532]]
