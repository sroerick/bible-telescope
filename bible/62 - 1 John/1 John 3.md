1 Behold [[G3708]] what manner of [[G4217]] love [[G26]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has given [[G1325]] to us, [[G1473]] that [[G2443]] we should be called [[G2564]] children [[G5043]] of God. [[G2316]] And [that is what] [[G2532]] we are! [[G1510]] The reason [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] does not know [[G1097]] us [[G1473]] [is] that [[G3754]] it did not know [[G1097]] Him. [[G846]] 
2 Beloved, [[G27]] we are [[G1510]] now [[G3568]] children [[G5043]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] we will be [[G1510]] {has} not yet [[G3768]] been revealed. [[G5319]] We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] when [[G1437]] [Christ] appears, [[G5319]] we will be [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] Him, [[G846]] for [[G3754]] we will see [[G3708]] Him [[G846]] as [[G2531]] He is. [[G1510]] 
3 And [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] this [[G3778]] hope [[G1680]] in [[G1909]] Him [[G846]] purifies [[G48]] himself, [[G1438]] just as [[G2531]] He [[G1565]] is [[G1510]] pure. [[G53]] 
4 Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] practices [[G4160]] sin [[G266]] practices [[G4160]] lawlessness [[G458]] as well. [[G2532]] Indeed, [[G2532]] sin [[G266]] is [[G1510]] lawlessness. [[G458]] 
5 [But] [[G2532]] you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [Christ] [[G1565]] appeared [[G5319]] to [[G2443]] take away [[G142]] sins, [[G266]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] sin. [[G266]] 
6 No one [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] keeps on sinning. [[G264]] No one [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] continues to sin [[G264]] has seen [[G3708]] Him [[G846]] [or] [[G3761]] known [[G1097]] Him. [[G846]] 
7 Little children, [[G5040]] {let} no one [[G3367]] deceive [[G4105]] you: [[G4771]] The [one who] [[G3588]] practices [[G4160]] righteousness [[G1343]] is [[G1510]] righteous, [[G1342]] just as [[G2531]] [Christ] [[G1565]] is [[G1510]] righteous. [[G1342]] 
8 The [one who] [[G3588]] practices [[G4160]] sin [[G266]] is [[G1510]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] has been sinning [[G264]] from [[G575]] [the] very start. [[G746]] This is why [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] was revealed, [[G5319]] to [[G2443]] destroy [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of the [[G3588]] devil. [[G1228]] 
9 Anyone [[G3956]] born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] refuses to practice [[G4160]] sin, [[G266]] because [[G3754]] [God’s] [[G846]] seed [[G4690]] abides [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him; [[G846]] he cannot [[G1410]] go on sinning, [[G264]] because [[G3754]] he has been born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]] 
10 By [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of God [[G2316]] are [[G1510]] distinguished [[G5318]] [from] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of the [[G3588]] devil: [[G1228]] Anyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] does not practice [[G4160]] righteousness [[G1343]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] [nor is] [[G2532]] anyone who [[G3588]] does not love [[G25]] his [[G846]] brother. [[G80]] 
11 This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] message [[G31]] you have heard [[G191]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning: [[G746]] We should love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]] 
12 [Do] not [be] [[G3756]] like [[G2531]] Cain, [[G2535]] [who] belonged to [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] evil [one] [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] murdered [[G4969]] his [[G846]] brother. [[G80]] And [[G2532]] why [[G5484]] did he slay [[G4969]] him? [[G846]] Because [[G3754]] his [[G846]] [own] [[G3588]] deeds [[G2041]] were [[G1510]] evil, [[G4190]] while [[G1161]] those [[G3588]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] [were] righteous. [[G1342]] 
13 [So] [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] be surprised, [[G2296]] brothers, [[G80]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] hates [[G3404]] you. [[G4771]] 
14 We [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we have passed [[G3327]] from [[G1537]] death [[G2288]] to [[G1519]] life, [[G2222]] because [[G3754]] we love [[G25]] [our] [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]] The [one who] [[G3588]] does not love [[G25]] remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] death. [[G2288]] 
15 Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] hates [[G3404]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] is [[G1510]] a murderer, [[G443]] and [[G2532]] you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] {does} not [[G3756]] reside [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] a [[G3956]] murderer. [[G443]] 
16 By [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] we know [[G1097]] what [[G3588]] love [is]: [[G26]] [Jesus] [[G1565]] laid down [[G5087]] His [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] us, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] we [[G1473]] ought [[G3784]] to lay down [[G5087]] [our] [[G3588]] lives [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] [our] [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]] 
17 If [[G302]] anyone [[G3739]] with [[G2192]] earthly [[G2889]] possessions [[G979]] sees [[G2334]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] [in] [[G2192]] need, [[G5532]] [but] [[G2532]] withholds [[G2808]] his [[G846]] compassion [[G4698]] from [[G575]] him, [[G846]] how [[G4459]] {can} the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of God [[G2316]] abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him? [[G846]] 
18 Little children, [[G5040]] let us love [[G25]] not [[G3361]] in word [[G3056]] [and] [[G3366]] speech, [[G1100]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] action [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] truth. [[G225]] 
19 And [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] we will know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we belong to [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] and [[G2532]] will assure [[G3982]] our [[G1473]] hearts [[G2588]] in His presence: [[G1715]] 
20 If [[G1437]] our [[G1473]] hearts [[G2588]] condemn [us], [[G2607]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] greater than [[G3173]] our [[G1473]] hearts, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] He knows [[G1097]] all things. [[G3956]] 
21 Beloved, [[G27]] if [[G1437]] our [[G1473]] hearts [[G2588]] do not condemn [us], [[G2607]] we have [[G2192]] confidence [[G3954]] before [[G4314]] God, [[G2316]] 
22 and [[G2532]] we will receive [[G2983]] from [[G575]] Him [[G846]] whatever [[G3739]] we ask, [[G154]] because [[G3754]] we keep [[G5083]] His [[G846]] commandments [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] what [[G3588]] is pleasing [[G701]] in His sight. [[G1799]] 
23 And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] His [[G846]] commandment: [[G1785]] that [[G2443]] we should believe [[G4100]] in the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of His [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] we should love [[G25]] one another [[G240]] just as [[G2531]] He commanded [[G1785]] us. [[G1473]] 
24 Whoever [[G3588]] keeps [[G5083]] His [[G846]] commandments [[G1785]] remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] [God], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [God] [[G846]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] He remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] us: [[G1473]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] He has given [[G1325]] us. [[G1473]]
