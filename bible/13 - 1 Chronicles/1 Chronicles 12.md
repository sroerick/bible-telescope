1 Now these [were] the [men] [[H428]] who came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] at Ziklag, [[H6860]] while [[H5750]] he was still banished [[H6113]] from the presence [[H6440]] of Saul [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] of Kish. [[H7027]] They [[H1992]] were among the warriors [[H1368]] who helped [[H5826]] him in battle; [[H4421]] 
2 they were archers [[H5401]] using both the right [[H3231]] and left [[H8041]] [to sling] stones [[H68]] and [to shoot] arrows; [[H2671]] [they were] Saul's [[H7586]] kinsmen [[H251]] from Benjamin: [[H1144]] 
3 Ahiezer [[H295]] their chief, [[H7218]] and Joash, [[H3101]] sons [[H1121]] of Shemaah [[H8094]] the Gibeathite; [[H1395]] Jeziel [[H3149]] and Pelet [[H6404]] the sons [[H1121]] of Azmaveth; [[H5820]] Beracah, [[H1294]] Jehu [[H3058]] the Anathothite, [[H6069]] 
4 Ishmaiah [[H3460]] the Gibeonite, [[H1393]] a mighty man [[H1368]] among the Thirty [[H7970]] and leader over [[H5921]] the Thirty; [[H7970]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] Jahaziel, [[H3166]] Johanan, [[H3076]] Jozabad [[H3107]] the Gederathite, [[H1452]] 
5 Eluzai, [[H498]] Jerimoth, [[H3406]] Bealiah, [[H1183]] Shemariah, [[H8114]] Shephatiah [[H8203]] the Haruphite; [[H2741]] 
6 Elkanah, [[H511]] Isshiah, [[H3449]] Azarel, [[H5832]] Joezer [[H3134]] and Jashobeam [[H3434]] the Korahites; [[H7145]] 
7 and Joelah [[H3132]] and Zebadiah [[H2069]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jeroham [[H3395]] from  Gedor. [[H1446]] 
8 Some  Gadites [[H1425]] defected [[H914]] to David [[H1732]] at his stronghold [[H4679]] in the desert. [[H4057]] They were mighty warriors, [[H1368]] trained for battle, [[H4421]] experts [[H6186]] with shield [[H6793]] and spear, [[H7420]] whose faces [were like] [[H6440]] the faces [[H6440]] of lions [[H743]] and who were as swift [[H4116]] as gazelles [[H6643]] on  the mountains: [[H2022]] 
9 Ezer [[H5829]] the chief, [[H7218]] Obadiah [[H5662]] the second [in command], [[H8145]] Eliab [[H446]] the third, [[H7992]] 
10 Mishmannah [[H4925]] the fourth, [[H7243]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the fifth, [[H2549]] 
11 Attai [[H6262]] the sixth, [[H8345]] Eliel [[H447]] the seventh, [[H7637]] 
12 Johanan [[H3076]] the eighth, [[H8066]] Elzabad [[H443]] the ninth, [[H8671]] 
13 Jeremiah [[H3414]] the tenth, [[H6224]] and Machbanai [[H4344]] the eleventh. [[H6249]] 
14 These [[H428]] Gadites [[H1121]] were army [[H6635]] commanders, [[H7218]] the least [of whom] [[H6996]] was a match for a hundred, [[H3967]] and the greatest [[H1419]] for a thousand. [[H505]] 
15 These [[H428]] are [[H1992]] the ones who [[H834]] crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] in the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] when it had overflowed [[H4390]] all [[H3605]] its banks, [[H1415]] and they put to flight [[H1272]] all [those] [[H3605]] in the valleys, [[H6010]] to the east [[H4217]] and to the west. [[H4628]] 
16 Other Benjamites [[H1121]] and some men from Judah [[H3063]] also came [[H935]] to David [[H1732]] in his stronghold. [[H4679]] 
17 And David [[H1732]] went out [[H3318]] to meet them, [[H6440]] saying, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you have come [[H935]] to me  in peace, [[H7965]] to help me, [[H5826]] my  heart [[H3824]] will be  united [[H3162]] with you;  but if [[H518]] you have come to betray [[H7411]] me to my enemies [[H6862]] when my hands [[H3709]] are free [[H3808]] of violence, [[H2555]] may the God [[H430]] of our fathers [[H1]] see [[H7200]] and judge you. [[H3198]] 
18 Then the Spirit [[H7307]] came upon [[H3847]] Amasai, [[H6022]] the chief [[H7218]] of the Thirty, and he said: [[H7970]] “We are yours,  O David! [[H1732]] We are with you,  O son [[H1121]] of Jesse! [[H3448]] Peace, [[H7965]] peace to you, [[H7965]] and peace [[H7965]] to your helpers, [[H5826]] for [[H3588]] your God [[H430]] will help you.” [[H5826]] So David [[H1732]] received [[H6901]] them and made [[H5414]] them leaders [[H7218]] of his troops. [[H1416]] 
19 Some [[H4480]] from Manasseh [[H4519]] defected [[H5307]] to [[H5921]] David [[H1732]] when he went [[H935]] with  the Philistines [[H6430]] to fight [[H4421]] against Saul. [[H7586]] (They did not [[H5826]] help the Philistines  because  the Philistine [[H6430]] rulers [[H5633]] consulted [[H6098]] and sent David away, [[H7971]] saying, [[H559]] “It will cost us our heads [[H7218]] if he defects [[H5307]] to  his master [[H113]] Saul.) [[H7586]] 
20 When David went [[H1980]] to  Ziklag, [[H6860]] these men of Manasseh [[H4519]] defected [[H5307]] to him:  Adnah, [[H5734]] Jozabad, [[H3107]] Jediael, [[H3043]] Michael, [[H4317]] Jozabad, [[H3107]] Elihu, [[H453]] and Zillethai, [[H6769]] chiefs [[H7218]] of thousands [[H505]] in Manasseh. [[H4519]] 
21 They  helped [[H5826]] David [[H1732]] against [[H5921]] the raiders, [[H1416]] for  they were [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] mighty warriors [[H1368]] and commanders [[H8269]] in the army. [[H6635]] 
22 For  at [that] time,  men came [[H935]] to  David [[H1732]] day [[H3117]] after day [[H3117]] to help him, [[H5826]] until [[H5704]] he had a great [[H1419]] army, [[H4264]] like the army [[H4264]] of God. [[H430]] 
23 Now these [are] [[H428]] the numbers [[H4557]] of men [[H7218]] armed [[H2502]] for battle [[H6635]] who came [[H935]] to  David [[H1732]] at Hebron [[H2275]] to turn Saul’s [[H7586]] kingdom [[H4438]] over [[H5437]] to him,  in accordance with the word of [[H6310]] the LORD: [[H3068]] 
24 From the Judahites: [[H1121]] 6,800 [[H8337]] armed [[H2502]] troops [[H6635]] bearing [[H5375]] shields [[H6793]] and spears. [[H7420]] 
25 From  the Simeonites: [[H1121]] 7,100 [[H7651]] mighty warriors, [[H1368]] ready for war. [[H6635]] 
26 From  the Levites: [[H1121]] 4,600, [[H702]] 
27 including Jehoiada, [[H3077]] leader [[H5057]] of the house of Aaron, [[H175]] with  3,700 [[H7969]] men, [[H3967]] 
28 and Zadok, [[H6659]] a valiant [[H2428]] young [[H5288]] warrior, [[H1368]] with 22 [[H6242]] commanders [[H8269]] from his own family. [[H1]] 
29 From the Benjamites, [[H1121]] the kinsmen [[H251]] of Saul: [[H7586]] 3,000, [[H7969]] most of whom [[H4768]] had remained [[H8104]] loyal to [[H4931]] the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] up to [[H5704]] that time. [[H2008]] 
30 From the Ephraimites: [[H1121]] 20,800 [[H6242]] mighty warriors, [[H1368]] famous [[H8034]] among their own clans. [[H1]] 
31 From the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh: [[H4519]] 18,000 [[H8083]] designated [[H5344]] by name [[H8034]] to come [[H935]] and make David [[H1732]] king. [[H4427]] 
32 From the Issacharites, [[H1121]] who understood [[H3045]] the times [[H6256]] and knew [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] Israel [[H3478]] should do: [[H6213]] 200 [[H3967]] chiefs [[H7218]] with all [[H3605]] their kinsmen [[H251]] at  their command. [[H6310]] 
33 From Zebulun: [[H2074]] 50,000 [[H2572]] fit for service, [[H3318]] trained [[H6186]] for battle [[H4421]] with all kinds [[H3605]] of weapons [[H3627]] of war, [[H4421]] who with one purpose [[H3820]] were devoted to David. [[H5737]] 
34 From Naphtali: [[H5321]] 1,000 [[H505]] commanders, [[H8269]] accompanied  by 37,000 [[H7970]] men with shield [[H6793]] and spear. [[H2595]] 
35 From the Danites: [[H1839]] 28,600 [[H6242]] prepared [[H6186]] for battle. [[H4421]] 
36 From Asher: [[H836]] 40,000 [[H705]] fit for service, [[H3318]] prepared [[H6186]] for battle. [[H4421]] 
37 And from east [[H5676]] of the Jordan, [[H3383]] from  the Reubenites, [[H7206]] Gadites, [[H1425]] and [[H2677]] the half-tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh [there]: [[H4519]] 120,000 [[H3967]] with every [kind] [[H3605]] of weapon [[H3627]] of war. [[H4421]] 
38 All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] arrayed [[H6186]] for battle, [[H4634]] came [[H935]] to Hebron [[H2275]] fully [[H8003]] determined [[H3824]] to make David [[H1732]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] And [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] the rest [[H7611]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] [were] of one [[H259]] mind [[H3820]] to make David [[H1732]] king. [[H4427]] 
39 They spent [[H1961]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] there [[H8033]] eating [[H398]] and drinking [[H8354]] with [[H5973]] David, [[H1732]] for their relatives [[H251]] had provided for them. [[H3559]] 
40 And their neighbors [[H1571]] from as far away as [[H5704]] Issachar, [[H3485]] Zebulun, [[H2074]] and Naphtali [[H5321]] came bringing [[H935]] food [[H3899]] on donkeys, [[H2543]] camels, [[H1581]] mules, [[H6505]] and oxen— [[H1241]] abundant supplies [[H7230]] of flour, [[H7058]] fig cakes [[H1690]] and [[H1690]] raisin cakes, [[H6778]] wine [[H3196]] and oil, [[H8081]] oxen [[H1241]] and sheep. [[H6629]] Indeed, [[H3588]] there was joy [[H8057]] in Israel. [[H3478]]
