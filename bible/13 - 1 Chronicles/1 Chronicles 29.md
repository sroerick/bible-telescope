[[1 Chronicles 28|←]] • [[2 Chronicles 1|→]]
1 Then King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to the whole [[H3605]] assembly, [[H6951]] “My son [[H1121]] Solomon, [[H8010]] whom  alone [[H259]] God [[H430]] has chosen, [[H977]] is young [[H5288]] and inexperienced. [[H7390]] The task [[H4399]] is great [[H1419]] because [[H3588]] this palace [[H1002]] will not [[H3808]] be for man, [[H120]] but [[H3588]] for the LORD [[H3068]] God. [[H430]] 
2 Now with all [[H3605]] my ability [[H3581]] I have made provision [[H3559]] for the house [[H1004]] of my God— [[H430]] gold [[H2091]] for the gold articles, [[H2091]] silver [[H3701]] for the silver, [[H3701]] bronze [[H5178]] for the bronze, [[H5178]] iron [[H1270]] for the iron, [[H1270]] and wood [[H6086]] for the wood, [[H6086]] as well as onyx [[H68]] for the settings, [[H4394]] turquoise, [[H68]] stones of various colors, [[H7553]] all kinds [[H3605]] of precious [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] and slabs [[H68]] of marble— [[H7893]] all in abundance. [[H7230]] 
3 Moreover, [[H5750]] because of my delight [[H7521]] in the house [[H1004]] of my God, [[H430]] I now give [[H5414]] for [it] [[H1004]] my personal treasures [[H5459]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] over and above [[H4605]] all [[H3605]] that I have provided [[H3559]] for this holy [[H6944]] temple: [[H1004]] 
4 three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of gold [[H2091]] (the gold [[H2091]] of Ophir) [[H211]] and seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of refined [[H2212]] silver, [[H3701]] to overlay [[H2902]] the walls [[H7023]] of the buildings, [[H1004]] 
5 for the gold work [[H2091]] and the silver work, [[H3701]] and for all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] to be done by [[H3027]] the craftsmen. [[H2796]] Now who [[H4310]] will volunteer [[H5068]] to consecrate [[H4390]] himself [[H3027]] to the LORD [[H3068]] today?” [[H3117]] 
6 Then the leaders [[H8269]] of the households, [[H1]] the officers [[H8269]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and of hundreds, [[H3967]] and the officials [[H8269]] in charge of the king’s [[H4428]] work [[H4399]] gave willingly. [[H5068]] 
7 Toward the service [[H5656]] of God’s [[H430]] house [[H1004]] they gave [[H5414]] 5,000 {} [[H2568]] talents [[H3603]] and 10,000 [[H7239]] darics [[H150]] of gold, [[H2091]] 10,000 {} [[H6235]] talents [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] 18,000 {} [[H7239]] talents [[H3603]] of bronze, [[H5178]] and 100,000 [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of iron. [[H1270]] 
8 Whoever had [[H4672]] precious stones [[H68]] gave [[H5414]] them to the treasury [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] under [[H5921]] the care [[H3027]] of Jehiel [[H3171]] the Gershonite. [[H1649]] 
9 Then the people [[H5971]] rejoiced [[H8055]] at [[H5921]] the willing response of their leaders, [[H5068]] for [[H3588]] they had given [[H5068]] to the LORD [[H3068]] freely and wholeheartedly. [[H8003]] And King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] also [[H1571]] rejoiced [[H8055]] greatly. [[H1419]] 
10 Then David [[H1732]] blessed [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the assembly [[H6951]] [and] [[H1732]] said: [[H559]] “May You [[H859]] be blessed, [[H1288]] O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of our father [[H1]] Israel, [[H3478]] from everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting. [[H5769]] 
11 Yours,  O LORD, [[H3069]] is the greatness [[H1420]] and the power [[H1369]] and the glory [[H8597]] and the splendor [[H1935]] and the majesty, [[H5331]] for [[H3588]] everything [[H3605]] in heaven [[H8064]] and on earth belongs to You. [[H776]] Yours,  O LORD, [[H3069]] is the kingdom, [[H4467]] and You are exalted [[H5375]] as head [[H7218]] over all. [[H3605]] 
12 Both riches [[H6239]] and honor [[H3519]] come from You, [[H6440]] and You [[H859]] are the ruler [[H4910]] over all. [[H3605]] Power [[H3581]] and might [[H1369]] are in Your hand, [[H3027]] and it is in Your hand [[H3027]] to exalt [[H1431]] and to give strength [[H2388]] to all. [[H3605]] 
13 Now therefore, [[H6258]] our God, [[H430]] we [[H587]] give You thanks, [[H3034]] and we praise [[H1984]] Your glorious [[H8597]] name. [[H8034]] 
14 But who [[H4310]] am I, [[H589]] and who [[H4310]] are my people, [[H5971]] that [[H3588]] we should be able [[H6113]] to give as generously [[H5068]] as this? [[H2063]] For [[H3588]] everything [[H3605]] comes from You, [[H4480]] and from Your own hand [[H3027]] we have given [[H5414]] to You.  
15 For [[H3588]] we [[H587]] [are] foreigners [[H1616]] and sojourners [[H8453]] in Your presence, [[H6440]] as were all [[H3605]] our forefathers. [[H1]] Our days [[H3117]] on [[H5921]] earth [[H776]] are like a shadow, [[H6738]] without [[H369]] hope. [[H4723]] 
16 O LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] from Your hand [[H3027]] comes [[H1931]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] abundance [[H1995]] that [[H834]] we have provided [[H3559]] for building [[H1129]] You  a house [[H1004]] for Your holy [[H6944]] Name, [[H8034]] and all of it [[H3605]] belongs to You.  
17 I know, [[H3045]] my God, [[H430]] that [[H3588]] You [[H859]] test [[H974]] the heart [[H3824]] and delight [[H7521]] in uprightness. [[H4339]] All [[H3605]] these things [[H428]] I [[H589]] have given willingly [[H5068]] and with an upright [[H3476]] heart, [[H3824]] and now [[H6258]] I have seen [[H7200]] Your people [[H5971]] who are present [[H4672]] here [[H6311]] giving joyfully [[H8057]] and willingly [[H5068]] to You.  
18 O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of our fathers [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Israel, [[H3478]] keep [[H8104]] this [[H2063]] desire [[H3336]] forever [[H5769]] in the intentions [[H4284]] of the hearts [[H3824]] of Your people, [[H5971]] and direct [[H3559]] their hearts [[H3824]] toward You. [[H413]] 
19 And give [[H5414]] my son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] a whole [[H8003]] heart [[H3824]] to keep [[H8104]] and carry out [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] Your commandments, [[H4687]] decrees, [[H5715]] and statutes, [[H2708]] and to build [[H1129]] [Your] palace [[H1002]] for which [[H834]] I have made provision.” [[H3559]] 
20 Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to the whole [[H3605]] assembly, [[H6951]] “Praise [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]] So the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] praised [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]] They bowed down [[H6915]] and paid homage [[H7812]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and to the king. [[H4428]] 
21 The next day [[H4283]] they offered [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and presented burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] a thousand [[H505]] bulls, [[H6499]] a thousand [[H505]] rams, [[H352]] and a thousand [[H505]] lambs, [[H3532]] along with their drink offerings, [[H5262]] and other sacrifices [[H2077]] in abundance [[H7230]] for all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
22 That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they ate [[H398]] and drank [[H8354]] with great [[H1419]] joy [[H8057]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Then, for a second [[H8145]] time, they designated David’s [[H1732]] son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] as king, [[H4427]] anointing him [[H4886]] before the LORD [[H3068]] as ruler, [[H5057]] and Zadok [[H6659]] as the priest. [[H3548]] 
23 So Solomon [[H8010]] sat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of the LORD [[H3068]] as king [[H4428]] in place of [[H8478]] his father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] He prospered, [[H6743]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] obeyed him. [[H8085]] 
24 All [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] and mighty men, [[H1368]] as well as [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] of King [[H4428]] David’s [[H1732]] sons, [[H1121]] pledged [[H5414]] their allegiance [[H3027]] to [[H8478]] King [[H4428]] Solomon. [[H8010]] 
25 The LORD [[H3068]] highly [[H4605]] exalted [[H1431]] Solomon [[H8010]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and bestowed [[H5414]] on him [[H5921]] royal [[H4438]] majesty [[H1935]] such as [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] been [[H1961]] bestowed on [[H5921]] any [[H3605]] king [[H4428]] in [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] before him. [[H6440]] 
26 David [[H1732]] son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] was king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
27 The length [[H3117]] of David's [[H834]] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] [was] forty [[H705]] years— [[H8141]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] in Hebron [[H2275]] and thirty-three years [[H7970]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
28 He died [[H4191]] at a ripe [[H2896]] old age, [[H7872]] full [[H7649]] of days, [[H3117]] riches, [[H6239]] and honor, [[H3519]] and his son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
29 Now the acts [[H1697]] of King [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] from first [[H7223]] to last, [[H314]] they are indeed [[H2009]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Chronicles [[H1697]] of Samuel [[H8050]] the Seer, [[H7200]] the Chronicles [[H1697]] of Nathan [[H5416]] the Prophet, [[H5030]] and [[H5921]] the Chronicles [[H1697]] of Gad [[H1410]] the Seer, [[H2374]] 
30 together with [[H5973]] all the details [[H3605]] of his reign, [[H4438]] his might, [[H1369]] and the circumstances [[H6256]] that [[H834]] came [[H5674]] upon him [[H5921]] [and] [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] [and] [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the lands. [[H776]]
