1 So all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] was recorded in the genealogies [[H3187]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] But Judah [[H3063]] was exiled [[H1540]] to Babylon [[H894]] because of their unfaithfulness. [[H4604]] 
2 Now the first [[H7223]] to resettle [[H3427]] their own property [[H272]] in their cities [[H5892]] were Israelites, [[H3478]] priests, [[H3548]] Levites, [[H3881]] and temple servants. [[H5411]] 
3 These were some [[H4480]] of the descendants [[H1121]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] who lived [[H3427]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] 
4 Uthai [[H5793]] son [[H1121]] of Ammihud, [[H5989]] the son [[H1121]] of Omri, [[H6018]] the son [[H1121]] of Imri, [[H566]] the son [[H1121]] of Bani, [[H1137]] a descendant [[H1121]] of Perez [[H6557]] son of Judah. [[H3063]] 
5 From [[H4480]] the Shilonites: [[H7888]] Asaiah [[H6222]] the firstborn [[H1060]] and his sons. [[H1121]] 
6 From [[H4480]] the Zerahites: [[H2226]] Jeuel [[H3262]] and 690 [[H8337]] relatives. [[H251]]

8 Ibneiah [[H2997]] son [[H1121]] of Jeroham; [[H3395]] Elah [[H425]] son [[H1121]] of Uzzi, [[H5813]] the son [[H1121]] of Michri; [[H4381]] Meshullam [[H4918]] son [[H1121]] of Shephatiah, [[H8203]] the son [[H1121]] of Reuel, [[H7467]] the son [[H1121]] of Ibnijah; [[H2998]] 
9 and 956 [[H8672]] of their relatives [[H251]] according to their genealogy. [[H8435]] All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] were heads [[H7218]] of their families. [[H1]] 
10 From [[H4480]] the priests: [[H3548]] Jedaiah; [[H3048]] Jehoiarib; [[H3080]] Jachin; [[H3199]] 
11 Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] the son [[H1121]] of Meshullam, [[H4918]] the son [[H1121]] of Zadok, [[H6659]] the son [[H1121]] of Meraioth, [[H4812]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahitub, [[H285]] the chief official [[H5057]] of God’s [[H430]] temple; [[H1004]] 
12 Adaiah [[H5718]] son [[H1121]] of Jeroham, [[H3395]] the son [[H1121]] of Pashhur, [[H6583]] the son [[H1121]] of Malchijah; [[H4441]] Maasai [[H4640]] son [[H1121]] of Adiel, [[H5717]] the son [[H1121]] of Jahzerah, [[H3170]] the son [[H1121]] of Meshullam, [[H4918]] the son [[H1121]] of Meshillemith, [[H4921]] the son [[H1121]] of Immer; [[H564]] 
13 and 1,760 [[H505]] of their relatives, [[H251]] the heads [[H7218]] of their families, [[H1004]] able [[H2428]] men [[H1368]] for the work [[H4399]] of the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]] 
14 From the Levites: [[H3881]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] son [[H1121]] of Hasshub, [[H2815]] the son [[H1121]] of Azrikam, [[H5840]] the son [[H1121]] of Hashabiah, [[H2811]] a descendant [[H1121]] of Merari; [[H4847]] 
15 Bakbakkar, [[H1230]] Heresh, [[H2792]] Galal, [[H1559]] and Mattaniah [[H4983]] son [[H1121]] of Mica, [[H4316]] the son [[H1121]] of Zichri, [[H2147]] the son [[H1121]] of Asaph; [[H623]] 
16 Obadiah [[H5662]] son [[H1121]] of Shemaiah, [[H8098]] the son [[H1121]] of Galal, [[H1559]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeduthun; [[H3038]] and Berechiah [[H1296]] son [[H1121]] of Asa, [[H609]] the son [[H1121]] of Elkanah [[H511]] who lived [[H3427]] in the villages [[H2691]] of the Netophathites. [[H5200]] 
17 [These were] the gatekeepers: [[H7778]] Shallum, [[H7967]] Akkub, [[H6126]] Talmon, [[H2929]] Ahiman, [[H289]] and their relatives. [[H251]] Shallum [[H7967]] was their chief; [[H7218]] 
18 he was previously stationed at the King’s [[H4428]] Gate [[H8179]] on the east side. [[H4217]] These [[H1992]] were the gatekeepers [[H7778]] from the camp [[H4264]] of the Levites. [[H1121]] 
19 Shallum [[H7967]] son [[H1121]] of Kore, [[H6981]] the son [[H1121]] of Ebiasaph, [[H43]] the son [[H1121]] of Korah, [[H7141]] and his relatives [[H251]] from the Korahites [[H7145]] were assigned to guard [[H8104]] the thresholds [[H5592]] of the Tent, [[H168]] just as their fathers [[H1]] had been assigned to [[H5921]] guard [[H8104]] the entrance [[H3996]] to the dwelling [[H4264]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
20 In earlier times [[H6440]] Phinehas [[H6372]] son [[H1121]] of Eleazar [[H499]] had been [[H1961]] in charge [[H5057]] of [the gatekeepers], [[H5921]] and the LORD [[H3068]] was with him. [[H5973]] 
21 Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1121]] of Meshelemiah [[H4920]] was the gatekeeper [[H7778]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
22 The number [[H3605]] of those chosen [[H1305]] to be gatekeepers [[H7778]] at the thresholds [[H5592]] was 212. [[H3967]] They [[H1992]] were registered by genealogy [[H3187]] in their villages. [[H2691]] David [[H1732]] and Samuel [[H8050]] the seer [[H7200]] had appointed [[H3245]] them [[H1992]] to their positions of trust. [[H530]] 
23 So they [[H1992]] and their descendants [[H1121]] were assigned to [[H5921]] guard [[H4931]] the gates [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] the house [[H1004]] called the Tent. [[H168]] 
24 The gatekeepers [[H7778]] were stationed [[H1961]] on the four [[H702]] sides: [[H7307]] east, [[H4217]] west, [[H3220]] north, [[H6828]] and south. [[H5045]] 
25 Their relatives [[H251]] came [[H935]] from their villages [[H2691]] at fixed times [[H6256]] to serve with [[H5973]] them [[H428]] for seven-day periods. [[H7651]] 
26 But [[H3588]] the four [[H702]] chief [[H1368]] gatekeepers, [[H7778]] who [[H1992]] were Levites, [[H3881]] were [[H1961]] entrusted with [[H5921]] the rooms [[H3957]] and the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]] 
27 They would spend the night [[H3885]] stationed around [[H5439]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] because [[H3588]] they had [[H5921]] responsibility for guarding it [[H4931]] and opening it [[H4669]] every morning. [[H1242]] 
28 Some of [[H1992]] them were in charge of [[H5921]] the articles [[H3627]] used in worship, [[H5656]] to [[H3588]] count them [[H4557]] whenever they were brought in [[H935]] [or] taken out. [[H3318]] 
29 Others were put [[H4487]] in charge of [[H5921]] the furnishings [[H3627]] and other [[H3605]] articles [[H3627]] of the sanctuary, [[H6944]] as well as the fine flour, [[H5560]] wine, [[H3196]] oil, [[H8081]] incense, [[H3828]] and spices. [[H1314]] 
30 And [some] [[H4480]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the priests [[H3548]] mixed [[H7543]] the spices. [[H1314]] 
31 A Levite [[H3881]] named Mattithiah, [[H4993]] the firstborn son [[H1060]] of Shallum [[H7967]] the Korahite, [[H7145]] was entrusted [[H530]] with [[H5921]] baking [[H4639]] the bread. [[H2281]] 
32 Some of [[H4480]] their Kohathite [[H1121]] brothers [[H251]] were responsible for [[H5921]] preparing [[H3559]] the rows [[H4635]] of the showbread [[H3899]] every Sabbath. [[H7676]] 
33 Those who were [[H428]] musicians, [[H7891]] the heads [[H7218]] of Levite [[H3881]] families, [[H1]] stayed in the temple chambers [[H3957]] and were exempt [[H6358]] [from other duties] [[H3588]] because they were [[H5921]] on duty [[H4399]] day [[H3119]] and night. [[H3915]] 
34 All these [[H428]] were heads [[H7218]] of Levite [[H3881]] families, [[H1]] chiefs [[H7218]] according to their genealogies, [[H8435]] and lived [[H3427]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
35 Jeiel [[H3273]] was the father [[H1]] of Gibeon, [[H1391]] and he lived [[H3427]] in Gibeon. [[H1391]] His wife’s [[H802]] name [[H8034]] was Maacah. [[H4601]] 
36 Abdon [[H5658]] was his firstborn [[H1060]] son, [[H1121]] then Zur, [[H6698]] Kish, [[H7027]] Baal, [[H1168]] Ner, [[H5369]] Nadab, [[H5070]] 
37 Gedor, [[H1446]] Ahio, [[H283]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] and Mikloth. [[H4732]] 
38 Mikloth [[H4732]] was the father of [[H3205]] Shimeam. [[H8043]] These [[H1992]] also [[H637]] lived [[H3427]] alongside [[H5048]] their relatives [[H251]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
39 Ner [[H5369]] was the father of [[H3205]] Kish, [[H7027]] Kish [[H7027]] was the father of [[H3205]] Saul, [[H7586]] and Saul [[H7586]] was the father of [[H3205]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] Malchishua, [[H4444]] Abinadab, [[H41]] and Esh-baal. [[H792]] 
40 The son [[H1121]] of Jonathan: [[H3083]] Merib-baal, [[H4807]] [who] [[H4810]] was the father of [[H3205]] Micah. [[H4318]] 
41 The sons [[H1121]] of Micah: [[H4318]] Pithon, [[H6377]] Melech, [[H4429]] Tahrea, [and Ahaz]. [[H8475]] 
42 Ahaz [[H271]] was the father of [[H3205]] Jarah; [[H3294]] Jarah [[H3294]] was the father of [[H3205]] Alemeth, [[H5964]] Azmaveth, [[H5820]] and Zimri; [[H2174]] and Zimri [[H2174]] was the father of [[H3205]] Moza. [[H4162]] 
43 Moza [[H4162]] was the father of [[H3205]] Binea. [[H1150]] Rephaiah [[H7509]] [was] his son, [[H1121]] Elasah [[H501]] his son, [[H1121]] and Azel [[H682]] his son. [[H1121]] 
44 And Azel [[H682]] had six [[H8337]] sons, [[H1121]] and these [[H428]] were their names: [[H8034]] Azrikam, [[H5840]] Bocheru, [[H1074]] Ishmael, [[H3458]] Sheariah, [[H8187]] Obadiah, [[H5662]] and Hanan. [[H2605]] These [were] [[H428]] the sons [[H1121]] of Azel. [[H682]]
