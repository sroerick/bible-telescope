1 Some time later, [[H310]] Nahash [[H5176]] king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] died [[H4191]] and was succeeded by [[H4427]] his son. [[H1121]] 
2 And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “I will show [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] Hanun [[H2586]] son [[H1121]] of Nahash, [[H5176]] because [[H3588]] his father [[H1]] showed [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to me.” [[H5973]] So David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to console [Hanun] [[H5162]] concerning [[H5921]] his father. [[H1]] But when David’s [[H1732]] servants [[H5650]] arrived [[H935]] in [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] to console him, [[H5162]] 
3 the princes [[H8269]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] said [[H559]] to Hanun, [[H2586]] “Just because [[H3588]] David has sent [[H7971]] you  comforters, [[H5162]] do you really believe [[H5869]] he is [[H1732]] showing respect [[H3513]] for your father? [[H1]] Have not [[H3808]] his servants [[H5650]] come [[H935]] to you [[H413]] to explore [[H2713]] the land, [[H776]] spy it out, [[H7270]] and overthrow it? [[H2015]] 
4 So Hanun [[H2586]] took [[H3947]] David’s [[H1732]] servants, [[H5650]] shaved [their beards], [[H1548]] cut [[H3772]] their garments [[H4063]] in half [[H2677]] at [[H5704]] the hips, [[H4667]] and sent them away. [[H7971]] 
5 When [someone] came [[H1980]] and told [[H5046]] David [[H1732]] about [[H5921]] his men, [[H582]] he sent [[H7971]] messengers to meet them, [[H7125]] since [[H3588]] the men [[H582]] were [[H1961]] deeply [[H3966]] humiliated. [[H3637]] The king [[H4428]] told them, [[H559]] “Stay [[H3427]] in Jericho [[H3405]] until [[H5704]] your beards [[H2206]] have grown back, [[H6779]] and [then] return. [[H7725]] 
6 When the Ammonites [[H1121]] realized that [[H7200]] they had become a stench [[H887]] to [[H5973]] David, [[H1732]] Hanun [[H2586]] and the Ammonites [[H1121]] sent [[H7971]] a thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] to hire [[H7936]] for themselves  chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H6571]] from [[H4480]] Aram-naharaim, [[H763]] Aram-maacah, [[H4601]] and Zobah. [[H6678]] 
7 So they hired [[H7936]] for themselves  thirty-two [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] chariots, [[H7393]] as well as [[H853]] the king [[H4428]] of Maacah [[H4601]] with his troops, [[H5971]] who came [[H935]] and camped [[H2583]] near [[H6440]] Medeba [[H4311]] while the Ammonites [[H1121]] came from their cities [[H5892]] and marched out [[H622]] for battle. [[H4421]] 
8 On hearing this, [[H8085]] David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] Joab [[H3097]] and [[H853]] the entire [[H3605]] army [[H6635]] of mighty men. [[H1368]] 
9 The Ammonites [[H1121]] marched out [[H3318]] and arrayed themselves [[H6186]] for battle [[H4421]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the city, [[H5892]] while the kings [[H4428]] who [[H834]] had come [[H935]] stayed by themselves [[H905]] in the open country. [[H7704]] 
10 When Joab [[H3097]] saw [[H7200]] the battle lines [[H4421]] before him [[H6440]] and behind him, [[H268]] he selected [[H977]] some of [[H3605]] the best [[H970]] men of Israel [[H3478]] and arrayed them [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the Arameans. [[H758]] 
11 And [[H853]] he placed [[H5414]] the rest [[H3499]] of the forces [[H5971]] under the command [[H3027]] of his brother [[H251]] Abishai, [[H52]] who arrayed them [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the Ammonites. [[H1121]] 
12 “If [[H518]] the Arameans [[H758]] are too strong [[H2388]] for me,” [[H4480]] said Joab, [[H559]] “then you will come [[H1961]] to my rescue. [[H8668]] And if [[H518]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] are too strong [[H2388]] for you, [[H4480]] then I will come to your rescue. [[H3467]] 
13 Be strong [[H2388]] and let us fight bravely [[H2388]] for [[H1157]] our people [[H5971]] and for [[H1157]] the cities [[H5892]] of our God. [[H430]] May the LORD [[H3068]] do [[H2896]] what is good [[H6213]] in His sight.” [[H5869]] 
14 So Joab [[H3097]] and his troops [[H5971]] advanced [[H5066]] to fight [[H4421]] the Arameans, [[H758]] who fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]] 
15 When the Ammonites [[H1121]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the Arameans [[H758]] had fled, [[H5127]] they [[H1992]] too [[H1571]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] Joab’s brother [[H251]] Abishai, [[H52]] and they entered [[H935]] the city. [[H5892]] So Joab [[H3097]] went back [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
16 When the Arameans [[H758]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they had been defeated [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] they sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to bring [[H3318]] [more] Arameans [[H758]] from beyond [[H5676]] the Euphrates, [[H5104]] with Shophach [[H7780]] the commander [[H8269]] of Hadadezer’s [[H1909]] army [[H6635]] leading them. [[H6440]] 
17 When this was reported [[H5046]] to David, [[H1732]] he gathered [[H622]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] and went [[H935]] against [[H413]] the Arameans, [[H758]] arrayed for battle [[H6186]] against them. [[H413]] When David [[H1732]] lined up [[H6186]] to engage [them] [[H7125]] in battle, [[H4421]] they fought [[H3898]] against him. [[H5973]] 
18 But the Arameans [[H758]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] and David [[H1732]] killed [[H2026]] seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] of their charioteers [[H7393]] and forty [[H705]] thousand [[H505]] foot soldiers. [[H376]] He also killed [[H4191]] Shophach [[H7780]] the commander [[H8269]] of their army. [[H6635]] 
19 When Hadadezer’s [[H1909]] subjects [[H5650]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they had been defeated [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] they made peace [[H7999]] with [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] and became subject to him. [[H5647]] So the Arameans [[H758]] were unwilling [[H3808]] to help [[H3467]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] anymore. [[H5750]]
