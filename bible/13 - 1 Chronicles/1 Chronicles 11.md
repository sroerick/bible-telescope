1 Then all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] came together [[H6908]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] at Hebron [[H2275]] and said, [[H559]] “Here [[H2009]] we [are], [[H587]] your own flesh [[H1320]] and blood. [[H6106]] 
2 Even [[H1571]] in times past, [[H8032]] while Saul [[H7586]] was [[H1961]] king, [[H4428]] you [were] [[H859]] the one who led [[H3318]] Israel out [[H3478]] and brought them back. [[H935]] And to you  the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] ‘You [[H859]] will shepherd [[H7462]] My people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and you [[H859]] will be [[H1961]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] [them]. [[H5971]] 
3 So all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] at Hebron, [[H2275]] [where] [[H2275]] David [[H1732]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with them  before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] And they anointed [[H4886]] [him] [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] through [[H3027]] Samuel. [[H8050]] 
4 Then David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] marched [[H1980]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] (that is, [[H1931]] Jebus), [[H2982]] where [[H8033]] the Jebusites [[H2983]] inhabited [[H3427]] the land. [[H776]] 
5 The people [[H3427]] of Jebus [[H2982]] said [[H559]] to David, [[H1732]] “You will never [[H3808]] get in [[H935]] here.” [[H2008]] Nevertheless, David [[H1732]] captured [[H3920]] the fortress [[H4686]] of Zion [[H6726]] (that is, [[H1931]] the City [[H5892]] of David). [[H1732]] 
6 Now David [[H1732]] had said, [[H559]] “Whoever [[H3605]] is the first [[H7223]] to strike down [[H5221]] a Jebusite [[H2983]] will become [[H1961]] chief [[H8269]] commander.” [[H7218]] And Joab [[H3097]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] went up [[H5927]] first, [[H7223]] and he became [[H1961]] the chief. [[H7218]] 
7 So David [[H1732]] took up residence [[H3427]] in the fortress; [[H4679]] that is why [[H5921]] it was called [[H7121]] the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] 
8 He built up [[H1129]] the city [[H5892]] around it, [[H5439]] from [[H4480]] the supporting terraces [[H4407]] to [[H5704]] the surrounding wall, [[H5439]] while Joab [[H3097]] restored [[H2421]] the rest [[H7605]] of the city. [[H5892]] 
9 And David [[H1732]] became [[H1980]] greater [[H1980]] and greater, [[H1419]] for the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] was with him. [[H5973]] 
10 Now these [were] [[H428]] the chiefs [[H7218]] of David’s [[H1732]] mighty men, [[H1368]] who, [[H834]] together with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] gave [[H4427]] strong support [[H2388]] to his kingdom, [[H4438]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] concerning [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
11 This [[H428]] is the list [[H4557]] of David’s [[H1732]] mighty men: [[H1368]] Jashobeam [[H3434]] son [[H1121]] of Hachmoni [[H2453]] was chief [[H7218]] of the officers; [[H7970]] he [[H1931]] wielded [[H5782]] his spear [[H2595]] against [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] hundred men, [[H3967]] whom he killed [[H2491]] at one [[H259]] time. [[H6471]] 
12 Next in command was [[H310]] Eleazar [[H499]] son [[H1121]] of Dodo [[H1734]] the Ahohite, [[H266]] one of the three [[H7969]] mighty men. [[H1368]] 
13 He [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] at Pas-dammim [[H6450]] when the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered [[H622]] there [[H8033]] for battle. [[H4421]] At [[H1961]] the place [[H2513]] with a field [[H7704]] full of [[H4392]] barley, [[H8184]] the troops [[H5971]] fled [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] the Philistines. [[H6430]] 
14 But Eleazar and David stationed themselves [[H3320]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the field [[H2513]] and defended it. [[H5337]] They struck down [[H5221]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and the LORD [[H3068]] brought about [[H3467]] a great [[H1419]] victory. [[H8668]] 
15 Three [[H7969]] of [[H4480]] the thirty [[H7970]] chief men [[H7218]] went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] to [[H5921]] the rock [[H6697]] at [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] of Adullam, [[H5725]] while a company [[H4264]] of Philistines [[H6430]] was encamped [[H2583]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]] 
16 At that time [[H227]] David [[H1732]] was in the stronghold, [[H4686]] and the garrison [[H5333]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] was at Bethlehem. [[H1035]] 
17 David [[H1732]] longed for water [[H183]] and said, [[H559]] “Oh, that someone [[H4310]] would get me a drink [[H8248]] of water [[H4325]] from the well [[H953]] near the gate [[H8179]] of Bethlehem!” [[H1035]] 
18 So the Three [[H7969]] broke [[H1234]] through the Philistine [[H6430]] camp, [[H4264]] drew [[H7579]] water [[H4325]] from the well [[H953]] at the gate [[H8179]] of Bethlehem, [[H1035]] and brought it [[H935]] back to [[H413]] David. [[H1732]] But he [[H1732]] refused [[H3808]] to drink it; [[H8354]] instead, he poured it out [[H5258]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] 
19 saying, [[H559]] “Far be it [[H2486]] from me,  my God, [[H430]] to do [[H6213]] this! [[H2063]] How can I drink [[H8354]] the blood [[H1818]] of these [[H428]] men [[H582]] who risked their lives?” [[H5315]] Because [[H3588]] they had brought it [[H935]] at the risk of their lives, [[H5315]] [David] refused [[H14]] to drink it. [[H8354]] Such [[H428]] were the exploits [[H6213]] of the three [[H7969]] mighty men. [[H1368]] 
20 Now Abishai, [[H52]] the brother [[H251]] of Joab, [[H3097]] was [[H1961]] chief [[H7218]] of the Three, [[H7969]] and he [[H1931]] lifted [[H5782]] his spear [[H2595]] against [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] hundred [men], [[H3967]] killed [them], [[H2490]] and won [[H3808]] a name [[H8034]] along with [the] Three. [[H7969]] 
21 Among [[H4480]] the thirty [[H7969]] he was most [[H8147]] honored, [[H3513]] and he became [[H1961]] their commander, [[H8269]] even though he was not [[H3808]] included [[H935]] among the Three. [[H7969]] 
22 And Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] was a valiant warrior [[H376]] from [[H4480]] Kabzeel, [[H6909]] a man of many [[H7227]] exploits. [[H6467]] [He] [[H1931]] struck down [[H5221]] two [[H8147]] champions [[H739]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and on a snowy [[H7950]] day [[H3117]] he [[H1931]] went down [[H3381]] into [[H8432]] a pit [[H953]] and killed [[H5221]] a lion. [[H738]] 
23 He [[H1931]] also killed [[H5221]] an Egyptian, [[H4713]] a huge [[H376]] man [[H4060]] five [[H2568]] cubits [tall]. [[H520]] Although the Egyptian [[H4713]] had a spear [[H2595]] like a weaver’s [[H707]] beam [[H4500]] in his hand, [[H3027]] Benaiah went against [[H3381]] him [[H413]] with a club, [[H7626]] snatched [[H1497]] the spear [[H2595]] from [his] [[H4713]] hand, [[H3027]] and killed [the Egyptian] [[H2026]] with his own spear. [[H2595]] 
24 These [[H428]] were the exploits [[H6213]] of Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] who won  a name [[H8034]] alongside the three [[H7969]] mighty men. [[H1368]] 
25 He was the most honored [[H3513]] of [[H4480]] the Thirty, [[H7970]] but he [[H1931]] did not [[H3808]] become [[H935]] one of [[H413]] the Three. [[H7969]] And David [[H1732]] appointed [[H7760]] him over [[H5921]] his guard. [[H4928]] 
26 Now [these were] the mighty men: [[H1368]] Asahel [[H6214]] the brother [[H251]] of Joab, [[H3097]] Elhanan [[H445]] son [[H1121]] of Dodo [[H1734]] of  Bethlehem, [[H1035]]
