[[1 Chronicles 14|←]] • [[1 Chronicles 16|→]]
1 David constructed [[H6213]] buildings [[H1004]] for himself  in the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] and he prepared [[H3559]] a place [[H4725]] for the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] and pitched [[H5186]] a tent [[H168]] for it.  
2 Then [[H227]] David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “No [[H3808]] one but [[H3588]] the Levites [[H3881]] may carry [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has chosen [[H977]] them to carry [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and to minister [[H8334]] before Him [[H5704]] forever.” [[H5769]] 
3 And David [[H1732]] assembled [[H6950]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] in [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] to bring up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] he had prepared [[H3559]] for it.  
4 Then he [[H1732]] gathered together [[H622]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] and the Levites: [[H3881]] 
5 From the Kohathites, [[H1121]] Uriel [[H222]] the chief [[H8269]] and 120 [[H3967]] of his relatives; [[H251]] 
6 from the Merarites, [[H1121]] Asaiah [[H6222]] the chief [[H8269]] and 220 [[H3967]] of his relatives; [[H251]] 
7 from the Gershomites, [[H1121]] Joel [[H3100]] the chief [[H8269]] and 130 [[H3967]] of his relatives; [[H251]] 
8 from the Elizaphanites, [[H1121]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the chief [[H8269]] and 200 [[H3967]] of his relatives; [[H251]] 
9 from the Hebronites, [[H1121]] Eliel [[H447]] the chief [[H8269]] and 80 [[H8084]] of his relatives; [[H251]] 
10 [and] from the Uzzielites, [[H1121]] Amminadab [[H5992]] the chief [[H8269]] and 112 [[H3967]] of his relatives. [[H251]] 
11 David [[H1732]] summoned [[H7121]] the priests [[H3548]] Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar [[H54]] and the Levites [[H3881]] Uriel, [[H222]] Asaiah, [[H6222]] Joel, [[H3100]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] Eliel, [[H447]] and Amminadab. [[H5992]] 
12 And he said to them, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] are the heads [[H7218]] of the Levitical [[H3881]] families. [[H1]] You [[H859]] and your relatives [[H251]] must consecrate yourselves [[H6942]] so that you may bring [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to [the place] [[H413]] I have prepared [[H3559]] for it.  
13 It was because [[H3588]] you Levites [[H859]] were not with us [[H3808]] the first time [[H7223]] that the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] burst forth in anger [[H6555]] against us.  For [[H3588]] we did not [[H3808]] consult Him [[H1875]] about the proper order.” [[H4941]] 
14 So the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] consecrated themselves [[H6942]] to bring up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
15 And the Levites [[H1121]] carried [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] on their shoulders [[H3802]] with the poles, [[H4133]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had commanded [[H6680]] in accordance with the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
16 David also [[H1732]] told [[H559]] the leaders [[H8269]] of the Levites [[H3881]] to appoint [[H5975]] their relatives [[H251]] as singers [[H7891]] to raise [[H7311]] their voices [[H6963]] with joy, [[H8057]] accompanied by musical [[H7892]] instruments— [[H3627]] harps, [[H5035]] lyres, [[H3658]] and cymbals. [[H4700]] 
17 So the Levites [[H3881]] appointed [[H5975]] Heman [[H1968]] son [[H1121]] of Joel; [[H3100]] from [[H4480]] his brothers, [[H251]] Asaph [[H623]] son [[H1121]] of Berechiah; [[H1296]] and from [[H4480]] their brothers [[H251]] the Merarites, [[H1121]] Ethan [[H387]] son [[H1121]] of Kushaiah; [[H6984]] 
18 and with them [[H5973]] their brothers [[H251]] next in rank: [[H4932]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] Jaaziel, [[H3268]] Shemiramoth, [[H8070]] Jehiel, [[H3171]] Unni, [[H6042]] Eliab, [[H446]] Benaiah, [[H1141]] Maaseiah, [[H4641]] Mattithiah, [[H4993]] Eliphelehu, [[H466]] Mikneiah, [[H4737]] and the gatekeepers [[H7778]] Obed-edom [[H5654]] and Jeiel. [[H3273]] 
19 The musicians [[H7891]] Heman, [[H1968]] Asaph, [[H623]] and Ethan [[H387]] were to sound [[H8085]] the bronze [[H5178]] cymbals; [[H4700]] 
20 Zechariah, [[H2148]] Aziel, [[H5815]] Shemiramoth, [[H8070]] Jehiel, [[H3171]] Unni, [[H6042]] Eliab, [[H446]] Maaseiah, [[H4641]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] were to play the harps [[H5035]] according to [[H5921]] Alamoth; [[H5961]] 
21 and Mattithiah, [[H4993]] Eliphelehu, [[H466]] Mikneiah, [[H4737]] Obed-edom, [[H5654]] Jeiel, [[H3273]] and Azaziah [[H5812]] were to lead the music [[H5329]] with lyres [[H3658]] according to [[H5921]] Sheminith. [[H8067]] 
22 Chenaniah [[H3663]] the head [[H8269]] Levite [[H3881]] was the director [[H3256]] of the music [[H4853]] because [[H3588]] he [was] [[H1931]] highly skilled. [[H995]] 
23 Berechiah [[H1296]] and Elkanah [[H511]] were to be guardians [[H7778]] of the ark. [[H727]] 
24 Shebaniah, [[H7645]] Joshaphat, [[H3146]] Nethanel, [[H5417]] Amasai, [[H6022]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] Benaiah, [[H1141]] and Eliezer [[H461]] the priests [[H3548]] were to blow [[H2690]] the trumpets [[H2689]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of God. [[H430]] Obed-edom [[H5654]] and Jehiah [[H3174]] were also to be guardians [[H7778]] of the ark. [[H727]] 
25 So [[H1961]] David, [[H1732]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] went [[H1980]] with rejoicing [[H8057]] to bring [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] from [[H4480]] the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom. [[H5654]] 
26 And because God [[H430]] had helped [[H5826]] the Levites [[H3881]] who were carrying [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] they sacrificed [[H2076]] seven [[H7651]] bulls [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams. [[H352]] 
27 Now David [[H1732]] was dressed [[H3736]] in a robe [[H4598]] of fine linen, [[H948]] as were all [[H3605]] the Levites [[H3881]] who were carrying [[H5375]] the ark, [[H727]] as well as the singers [[H7891]] and Chenaniah, [[H3663]] the director [[H8269]] of music [[H4853]] for the singers. [[H7891]] David [[H1732]] also wore a linen [[H906]] ephod. [[H646]] 
28 So all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] brought up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] with shouting, [[H8643]] with the sounding [[H6963]] of ram’s horns [[H7782]] and trumpets, [[H2689]] and with cymbals [[H4700]] and the music [[H8085]] of harps [[H5035]] and lyres. [[H3658]] 
29 As the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] entering [[H935]] the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] Saul’s [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] Michal [[H4324]] looked down [[H8259]] from [[H1157]] a window [[H2474]] and saw [[H7200]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] dancing [[H7540]] and celebrating, [[H7832]] and she despised [[H959]] him  in her heart.
