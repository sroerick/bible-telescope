1 These were the sons [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Though he [[H1931]] was the firstborn, [[H1060]] his birthright [[H1062]] was given [[H5414]] to the sons [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] son [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] because Reuben defiled [[H2490]] his father’s [[H1]] bed. [[H3326]] So he is not [[H3808]] reckoned [[H3187]] according to birthright. [[H1062]] 
2 And though [[H3588]] Judah [[H3063]] prevailed [[H1396]] over his brothers [[H251]] and a ruler [[H5057]] came from him, [[H4480]] the birthright [[H1062]] belonged to Joseph. [[H3130]] 
3 The sons [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Israel: [[H3478]] Hanoch, [[H2585]] Pallu, [[H6396]] Hezron, [[H2696]] and Carmi. [[H3756]] 
4 The descendants [[H1121]] of Joel: [[H3100]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] his son, [[H1121]] Gog [[H1463]] his son, [[H1121]] Shimei [[H8096]] his son, [[H1121]] 
5 Micah [[H4318]] his son, [[H1121]] Reaiah [[H7211]] his son, [[H1121]] Baal [[H1168]] his son, [[H1121]] 
6 and Beerah [[H880]] his son, [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] Tiglath-pileser [[H8407]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] carried into exile. [[H1540]] Beerah [[H1931]] was a leader [[H5387]] of the Reubenites. [[H7206]] 
7 His relatives [[H251]] by their clans [[H4940]] are recorded [[H3187]] in their genealogy: [[H8435]] Jeiel [[H3273]] the chief, [[H7218]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] 
8 and Bela [[H1106]] son [[H1121]] of Azaz, [[H5811]] the son [[H1121]] of Shema, [[H8087]] the son [[H1121]] of Joel. [[H3100]] They [[H1931]] settled [[H3427]] in Aroer [[H6177]] and as far as [[H5704]] Nebo [[H5015]] and  Baal-meon. [[H1186]] 
9 They also settled [[H3427]] in the east [[H4217]] as far as [[H5704]] the edge of the desert [[H4057]] that extends [[H4480]] to the Euphrates [[H6578]] River, [[H5104]] because [[H3588]] their herds [[H4735]] had increased [[H7235]] in the land [[H776]] of Gilead. [[H1568]] 
10 During the days [[H3117]] of Saul [[H7586]] they waged [[H6213]] war [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] the Hagrites, [[H1905]] who were defeated [[H5307]] at their hands, [[H3027]] and they occupied [[H3427]] the homes [of the Hagrites] [[H168]] throughout [[H5921]] the region [[H6440]] east [[H4217]] of Gilead. [[H1568]] 
11 The descendants [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] lived [[H3427]] next to [the Reubenites] [[H5048]] in the land [[H776]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] as [[H5704]] far as Salecah: [[H5548]] 
12 Joel [was] [[H3100]] the chief, [[H7218]] Shapham [[H8223]] the second, [[H4932]] then Jaanai [[H3285]] and Shaphat, [[H8202]] [who lived] in Bashan. [[H1316]] 
13 Their kinsmen [[H251]] by families were [[H1]] Michael, [[H4317]] Meshullam, [[H4918]] Sheba, [[H7652]] Jorai, [[H3140]] Jacan, [[H3275]] Zia, [[H2127]] and Eber— [[H5677]] seven [in all]. [[H7651]] 
14 These [[H428]] were the sons [[H1121]] of Abihail [[H32]] son [[H1121]] of Huri, [[H2359]] the son [[H1121]] of Jaroah, [[H3386]] the son [[H1121]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] the son [[H1121]] of Michael, [[H4317]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeshishai, [[H3454]] the son [[H1121]] of Jahdo, [[H3163]] the son [[H1121]] of Buz. [[H938]] 
15 Ahi [[H277]] son [[H1121]] of Abdiel, [[H5661]] the son [[H1121]] of Guni, [[H1476]] was head [[H7218]] of their family. [[H1]] 
16 They lived [[H3427]] in Gilead, [[H1568]] in Bashan [[H1316]] and its towns, [[H1323]] and throughout [[H3605]] the pasturelands [[H4054]] of Sharon. [[H8289]] 
17 All of them [[H3605]] were reckoned in the genealogies [[H3187]] during the reigns [[H3117]] of Jotham [[H3147]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] [and] [[H3117]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
18 The Reubenites, [[H1121]] the Gadites, [[H1425]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] had 44,760 [[H705]] warriors— [[H3318]] valiant warriors [[H1121]] who carried [[H5375]] shield [[H4043]] and sword, [[H2719]] drew [[H1869]] the bow, [[H7198]] and were trained [[H3925]] for battle. [[H4421]] 
19 They waged [[H6213]] war [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] the Hagrites, [[H1905]] Jetur, [[H3195]] Naphish, [[H5305]] and Nodab. [[H5114]] 
20 And because [[H3588]] they cried out [[H2199]] to God [[H430]] in battle, [[H4421]] they were helped [[H5826]] against [their enemies], [[H5921]] and the Hagrites [[H1905]] and all [[H3605]] their allies [[H5973]] were delivered [[H5414]] into their hands. [[H3027]] Because [[H3588]] they put their trust [[H982]] in [God],  He answered their prayers. [[H6279]] 
21 They seized [[H7617]] the livestock [of the Hagrites]— [[H4735]] 50,000 [[H2572]] camels, [[H1581]] 250,000 {} [[H3967]] sheep, [[H6629]] and 2,000 [[H505]] donkeys. [[H2543]] [They also took] 100,000 [[H3967]] captives, [[H120]] 
22 and [[H3588]] many others [[H7227]] fell [[H5307]] slain, [[H2491]] because [[H3588]] the battle [[H4421]] belonged to God. [[H430]] And they occupied [[H3427]] the land [[H8478]] until [[H5704]] the exile. [[H1473]] 
23 Now the people [[H1121]] of the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] were numerous. [[H7235]] They settled [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] from Bashan [[H1316]] to [[H5704]] Baal-hermon (that is, [[H1179]] Senir [[H8149]] or Mount [[H2022]] Hermon). [[H2768]] 
24 These [[H428]] were the heads [[H7218]] of their families: [[H1]] Epher, [[H6081]] Ishi, [[H3469]] Eliel, [[H447]] Azriel, [[H5837]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] Hodaviah, [[H1938]] and Jahdiel. [[H3164]] [They were] mighty warriors, [[H1368]] famous [[H8034]] men, [[H376]] and heads [[H7218]] of their families. [[H1]] 
25 But they were unfaithful [[H4603]] to the God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] and they prostituted [[H2181]] themselves with [[H310]] the gods [[H430]] of the peoples [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] whom [[H834]] God [[H430]] had destroyed [[H8045]] before them. [[H6440]] 
26 So the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] stirred up [[H5782]] the spirit [[H7307]] of Pul [[H6322]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] (that is, [[H853]] Tiglath-pileser [[H8407]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria) [[H804]] to take the Reubenites, [[H7206]] Gadites, [[H1425]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] into exile. [[H1540]] And he brought [[H935]] them to Halah, [[H2477]] Habor, [[H2249]] Hara, [[H2024]] and the river [[H5104]] of Gozan, [[H1470]] where they remain to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]
