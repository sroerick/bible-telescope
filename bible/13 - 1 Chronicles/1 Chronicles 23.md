[[1 Chronicles 22|←]] • [[1 Chronicles 24|→]]
1 When David [[H1732]] was old [[H2204]] and full of [[H7646]] years, [[H3117]] he installed his son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] as king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
2 Then he gathered [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H8269]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as well as the priests [[H3548]] and Levites. [[H3881]] 
3 The Levites [[H3881]] thirty [[H7970]] years of age [[H1121]] and older [[H4605]] were counted, [[H5608]] and the total number [[H4557]] of men [[H1397]] was [[H1961]] 38,000 [[H7970]] 
4 “Of these,” [[H428]] said David, “24,000 [[H6242]] are to oversee [[H5329]] the work [[H4399]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] 6,000 [[H8337]] are to be officers [[H7860]] and judges, [[H8199]] 
5 4,000 [[H702]] are to be gatekeepers, [[H7778]] and 4,000 [[H702]] are to praise [[H1984]] the LORD [[H3068]] with the instruments [[H3627]] I have made [[H6213]] for giving praise.” [[H1984]] 
6 Then David [[H1732]] divided [the Levites] [[H2505]] into divisions [[H4256]] according to the sons [[H1121]] of Levi: [[H3878]] Gershom, [[H1647]] Kohath, [[H6955]] and Merari. [[H4847]] 
7 The Gershonites: [[H1649]] Ladan [[H3936]] and Shimei. [[H8096]] 
8 The sons [[H1121]] of Ladan: [[H3936]] Jehiel [[H3171]] was the first, [[H7218]] then Zetham, [[H2241]] and Joel— [[H3100]] three [in all]. [[H7969]] 
9 The sons [[H1121]] of Shimei: [[H8096]] Shelomoth, [[H8013]] Haziel, [[H2381]] and Haran— [[H2039]] three [in all]. [[H7969]] These [were] [[H428]] the heads [[H7218]] of the families [[H1]] of Ladan. [[H3936]] 
10 And the sons [[H1121]] of Shimei: [[H8096]] Jahath, [[H3189]] Zina, [[H2126]] Jeush, [[H3266]] and Beriah. [[H1283]] These [[H428]] [were] the sons [[H1121]] of Shimei— [[H8096]] four [in all]. [[H702]] 
11 Jahath [[H3189]] was [[H1961]] the first [[H7218]] and Zizah [[H2125]] was the second; [[H8145]] but Jeush [[H3266]] and Beriah [[H1283]] did not [[H3808]] have many [[H7235]] sons, [[H1121]] so they were counted as [[H1961]] one family [[H1]] and received a single [[H259]] assignment. [[H6486]] 
12 The sons [[H1121]] of Kohath: [[H6955]] Amram, [[H6019]] Izhar, [[H3324]] Hebron, [[H2275]] and Uzziel— [[H5816]] four [in all]. [[H702]] 
13 The sons [[H1121]] of Amram: [[H6019]] Aaron [[H175]] and Moses. [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] along with his descendants, [[H1121]] was set apart [[H914]] forever [[H5704]] to consecrate [[H6942]] the most holy things, [[H6944]] to burn incense [[H6999]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] to minister before Him, [[H8334]] and to pronounce blessings [[H1288]] in His name [[H8034]] forever. [[H5704]] 
14 As for Moses [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] his sons [[H1121]] were named [[H7121]] among [[H5921]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Levi. [[H3878]] 
15 The sons [[H1121]] of Moses: [[H4872]] Gershom [[H1647]] and Eliezer. [[H461]] 
16 The descendants [[H1121]] of Gershom: [[H1647]] Shebuel [[H7619]] was the first. [[H7218]] 
17 The descendants [[H1121]] of Eliezer: [[H461]] Rehabiah [[H7345]] was [[H1961]] the first. [[H7218]] Eliezer [[H461]] did not [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] any other [[H312]] sons, [[H1121]] but the sons [[H1121]] of Rehabiah [[H7345]] were very [[H4605]] numerous. [[H7235]] 
18 The sons [[H1121]] of Izhar: [[H3324]] Shelomith [[H8019]] was first. [[H7218]] 
19 The sons [[H1121]] of Hebron: [[H2275]] Jeriah [[H3404]] was first, [[H7218]] Amariah [[H568]] the second, [[H8145]] Jahaziel [[H3166]] the third, [[H7992]] and Jekameam [[H3360]] the fourth. [[H7243]] 
20 The sons [[H1121]] of Uzziel: [[H5816]] Micah [[H4318]] was first [[H7218]] and Isshiah [[H3449]] second. [[H8145]] 
21 The sons [[H1121]] of Merari: [[H4847]] Mahli [[H4249]] and Mushi. [[H4187]] The sons [[H1121]] of Mahli: [[H4249]] Eleazar [[H499]] and Kish. [[H7027]] 
22 Eleazar [[H499]] died [[H4191]] without [[H3808]] having [any] [[H1961]] sons; [[H1121]] he had only [[H3588]] daughters. [[H1323]] Their cousins, [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of Kish, [[H7027]] married them. [[H5375]] 
23 The sons [[H1121]] of Mushi: [[H4187]] Mahli, [[H4249]] Eder, [[H5740]] and Jeremoth— [[H3406]] three [in all]. [[H7969]] 
24 These [[H428]] were the descendants [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3878]] by their families— [[H1]] the heads [[H7218]] of families, [[H1]] registered [[H6485]] individually [[H1538]] by name— [[H8034]] those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who worked [[H6213]] in the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
25 For [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] had said, [[H559]] “The LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] has given rest [[H5117]] to His people [[H5971]] and has come to dwell [[H7931]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] forever. [[H5704]] 
26 So now [[H1571]] the Levites [[H3881]] no [[H369]] longer need to carry [[H5375]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] or any [[H3605]] of the articles [[H3627]] for its service.” [[H5656]] 
27 For [[H3588]] according to the final [[H314]] instructions [[H1697]] of David, [[H1732]] the Levites [[H1121]] twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] were counted, [[H4557]] 
28 but [[H3588]] their duty [[H4612]] was to assist [[H3027]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] with the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] being responsible for [[H5921]] the courts [[H2691]] and chambers, [[H3957]] the purification [[H2893]] of all [[H3605]] the holy things, [[H6944]] and the work [[H4639]] of the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] 
29 as well as for the rows [[H4635]] of the showbread, [[H3899]] the fine flour [[H5560]] for the grain offering, [[H4503]] the wafers [[H7550]] of unleavened bread, [[H4682]] the baking, [[H4227]] the mixing, [[H7246]] and all [[H3605]] measurements of volume [[H4884]] and size. [[H4060]] 
30 They were also to stand [[H5975]] every morning [[H1242]] to give thanks [[H3034]] and praise [[H1984]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and likewise [[H3651]] in the evening. [[H6153]] 
31 Whenever [[H3605]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] were presented [[H5927]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on the Sabbaths, [[H7676]] New Moons, [[H2320]] and appointed feasts, [[H4150]] they were to serve regularly [[H8548]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the numbers [[H4557]] prescribed [[H4941]] for them. [[H5921]] 
32 So [the Levites] were to carry out [[H8104]] the responsibilities [[H4931]] for the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and [[H853]] the Holy Place, [[H6944]] and, under [[H4931]] their brothers [[H251]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD.
