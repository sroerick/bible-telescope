1 These were the divisions [[H4256]] of the gatekeepers: [[H7778]] From the Korahites: [[H7145]] Meshelemiah [[H4920]] son [[H1121]] of Kore, [[H6981]] one of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of Asaph. [[H623]] 
2 Meshelemiah [[H4920]] had sons: [[H1121]] Zechariah [[H2148]] the firstborn, [[H1060]] Jediael [[H3043]] the second, [[H8145]] Zebadiah [[H2069]] the third, [[H7992]] Jathniel [[H3496]] the fourth, [[H7243]]

4 And  Obed-edom [[H5654]] also had sons: [[H1121]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the firstborn, [[H1060]] Jehozabad [[H3075]] the second, [[H8145]] Joah [[H3098]] the third, [[H7992]] Sachar [[H7940]] the fourth, [[H7243]] Nethanel [[H5417]] the fifth, [[H2549]] 
5 Ammiel [[H5988]] the sixth, [[H8345]] Issachar [[H3485]] the seventh, [[H7637]] and Peullethai [[H6469]] the eighth. [[H8066]] For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] had blessed [Obed-edom]. [[H1288]] 
6 Also to his son [[H1121]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] were born [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] who ruled [[H4474]] over their families [[H1]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] were strong, [[H1368]] capable men. [[H2428]] 
7 Shemaiah’s [[H8098]] sons [were] [[H1121]] Othni, [[H6273]] Rephael, [[H7501]] Obed, [[H5744]] and Elzabad; [[H443]] his brothers [were] [[H251]] Elihu [[H453]] and Semachiah, [[H5565]] also capable [[H2428]] men. [[H1121]] 
8 All [[H3605]] these [were] [[H428]] descendants [[H1121]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] with their sons [[H1121]] and brothers; [[H251]] they [[H1992]] were capable [[H2428]] men [[H376]] with strength [[H3581]] to do the work— [[H5656]] 62 [[H8346]] [in all]  from Obed-edom. [[H5654]] 
9 Meshelemiah [[H4920]] also had sons [[H1121]] and brothers [[H251]] who were capable [[H2428]] men— [[H1121]] 18 [in all]. [[H8083]] 
10 Hosah [[H2621]] the Merarite [[H1121]] also had sons: [[H1121]] Shimri [[H8113]] the first [[H7218]] (although [[H3588]] he was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] the firstborn, [[H1060]] his father [[H1]] had appointed [[H7760]] him as the first), [[H7218]] 
11 Hilkiah [[H2518]] the second, [[H8145]] Tebaliah [[H2882]] the third, [[H7992]] and Zechariah [[H2148]] the fourth. [[H7243]] The sons [[H1121]] and brothers [[H251]] of Hosah [[H2621]] [numbered] 13 [[H7969]] in all. [[H3605]] 
12 These [[H428]] divisions [[H4256]] of the gatekeepers, [[H7778]] through their chief [[H7218]] men, [[H1397]] had duties [[H4931]] for ministering [[H8334]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H5980]] their brothers did. [[H251]] 
13 They cast [[H5307]] lots [[H1486]] for each gate, [[H8179]] according to their families, [[H1]] young [[H6996]] and old alike. [[H1419]] 
14 The lot [[H1486]] for the East [Gate] [[H4217]] fell [[H5307]] to Shelemiah. [[H8018]] Then lots [[H1486]] were cast [[H5307]] for his son [[H1121]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] a wise [[H7922]] counselor, [[H3289]] and the lot [[H1486]] for the north gate [[H6828]] fell to him. [[H3318]] 
15 [The lot for] the South [Gate] [[H5045]] [fell] to  Obed-edom, [[H5654]] and the lot for the storehouses [[H1004]] to his sons. [[H1121]] 
16 [The lots] for the West Gate [[H4628]] and [[H5973]] the Shallecheth [[H7996]] Gate [[H8179]] on the ascending [[H5927]] highway [[H4546]] [fell to] Shuppim [[H8206]] and Hosah. [[H2621]] There were guards [[H4929]] stationed [[H5980]] at every watch. [[H4929]] 
17 Each day [[H3117]] there were six [[H8337]] Levites [[H3881]] on the east, [[H4217]] four [[H702]] on the north, [[H6828]] four [[H702]] on the south, [[H5045]] and two pairs [[H8147]] at the storehouse. [[H624]] 
18 As for the court [[H6503]] on the west, [[H4628]] there were four [[H702]] at the highway [[H4546]] and two [[H8147]] at the court. [[H6503]] 
19 These [were] [[H428]] the divisions [[H4256]] of the gatekeepers [[H7778]] who were descendants [[H1121]] of Korah [[H7145]] [and] [[H1121]] Merari. [[H4847]] 
20 Now their fellow Levites [[H3881]] were in charge of [[H5921]] the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] and the treasuries [[H214]] of the dedicated things. [[H6944]] 
21 From the descendants [[H1121]] of Ladan, [[H3936]] who were [[H1121]] Gershonites [[H1649]] through Ladan [[H3936]] and heads [[H7218]] of the families [[H1]] of Laadan [[H3936]] the Gershonite, [[H1649]] [were] Jehieli, [[H3172]] 
22 the sons [[H1121]] of Jehieli, [[H3172]] Zetham, [[H2241]] and his brother [[H251]] Joel. [[H3100]] They were in charge of [[H5921]] the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
23 From the Amramites, [[H6020]] the Izharites, [[H3325]] the Hebronites, [[H2276]] and the Uzzielites: [[H5817]] 
24 Shebuel, [[H7619]] a descendant [[H1121]] of Gershom [[H1647]] son of [[H1121]] Moses, [[H4872]] was the officer [[H5057]] in charge of [[H5921]] the treasuries. [[H214]] 
25 His relatives [[H251]] through Eliezer [included] [[H461]] Rehabiah [[H7345]] his son, [[H1121]] Jeshaiah [[H3470]] his son, [[H1121]] Joram [[H3141]] his son, [[H1121]] Zichri [[H2147]] his son, [[H1121]] and Shelomith [[H8013]] his son. [[H1121]] 
26 This [[H1931]] Shelomith [[H8013]] and his brothers [[H251]] were in charge of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the treasuries [[H214]] for the things [[H834]] dedicated [[H6942]] by King [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] by the heads [[H7218]] of families [[H1]] who were the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and of hundreds, [[H3967]] and by the army [[H6635]] commanders. [[H8269]] 
27 They dedicated [[H6942]] some of [[H4480]] the plunder [[H7998]] from [[H4480]] their battles [[H4421]] for the repair [[H2388]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] temple. [[H1004]] 
28 Everything [[H3605]] dedicated [[H6942]] by Samuel [[H8050]] the seer, [[H7200]] Saul [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] of Kish, [[H7027]] Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] and Joab [[H3097]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] along with everything else [[H3605]] that was dedicated, [[H6942]] was under [[H5921]] the care [[H3027]] of Shelomith [[H8019]] and his brothers. [[H251]] 
29 From the Izrahites: [[H3325]] Chenaniah [[H3663]] and his sons [[H1121]] had the outside [[H2435]] duties [[H4399]] as officers [[H7860]] and judges [[H8199]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
30 From the Hebronites: [[H2276]] Hashabiah [[H2811]] and his relatives, [[H251]] 1,700 [[H505]] capable [[H2428]] men, [[H1121]] had charge of the affairs [[H6486]] of Israel [[H3478]] west [[H4628]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] for all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and for the service [[H5656]] of the king. [[H4428]] 
31 As for the Hebronites, [[H2276]] Jerijah [[H3404]] was the chief [[H7218]] of the Hebronites, [[H2276]] according to the genealogies [[H8435]] of his ancestors. [[H1]] In the fortieth [[H705]] year [[H8141]] of David’s [[H1732]] reign [[H4438]] [the records] were searched, [[H1875]] and strong, [[H1368]] capable men [[H2428]] were found [[H4672]] among [the Hebronites]  at Jazer [[H3270]] in Gilead. [[H1568]] 
32 Among Jerijah’s relatives [[H251]] [there were] 2,700 [[H505]] capable [[H2428]] men [[H1121]] who were heads [[H7218]] of families. [[H1]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] appointed [[H6485]] them over [[H5921]] the Reubenites, [[H7206]] the Gadites, [[H1425]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4520]] for every [[H3605]] matter [pertaining to] [[H1697]] God [[H430]] and the affairs [[H1697]] of the king.
