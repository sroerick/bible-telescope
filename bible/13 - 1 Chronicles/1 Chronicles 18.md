1 Some time later, [[H1961]] David [[H1732]] defeated [[H5221]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] subdued them, [[H3665]] and took [[H3947]] Gath [[H1661]] and its villages [[H1323]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] 
2 [David] also defeated [[H5221]] the Moabites, [[H4124]] and they [[H4124]] became [[H1961]] subject [[H5650]] to David [[H1732]] and brought him [[H5375]] tribute. [[H4503]] 
3 [As far as] Hamath, [[H2574]] David [[H1732]] also defeated [[H5221]] King [[H4428]] Hadadezer [[H1909]] of Zobah, [[H6678]] who had marched out [[H1980]] to establish [[H5324]] his dominion [[H3027]] along the Euphrates [[H6578]] River. [[H5104]] 
4 David [[H1732]] captured [[H3920]] from him [[H4480]] a thousand [[H505]] chariots, [[H7393]] seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] charioteers, [[H6571]] and twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] foot soldiers, [[H7273]] and he hamstrung [[H6131]] all [[H3605]] the horses [[H7393]] except a hundred [[H3967]] he kept [[H3498]] for the chariots. [[H7393]] 
5 When the Arameans [[H758]] of Damascus [[H1834]] came [[H935]] to help [[H5826]] King [[H4428]] Hadadezer [[H1909]] of Zobah, [[H6678]] David [[H1732]] struck down [[H5221]] twenty-two [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]] 
6 Then he [[H1732]] placed [garrisons] [[H7760]] in Aram [[H758]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] and the Arameans [[H758]] became [[H1961]] subject [[H5650]] to David [[H1732]] and brought him [[H5375]] tribute. [[H4503]] So the LORD [[H3068]] made David [[H1732]] victorious [[H3467]] wherever [[H3605]] he went. [[H1980]] 
7 And David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] the gold [[H2091]] shields [[H7982]] that [[H834]] belonged [[H1961]] to [[H5921]] the officers [[H5650]] of Hadadezer [[H1909]] and brought them [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
8 And from Tibhath [[H2880]] and Cun, [[H3560]] cities [[H5892]] of Hadadezer, [[H1909]] David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] a large [[H3966]] amount [[H7227]] of bronze, [[H5178]] with which  Solomon [[H8010]] made [[H6213]] the bronze [[H5178]] Sea, [[H3220]] the pillars, [[H5982]] and [various] [[H853]] bronze [[H5178]] articles. [[H3627]] 
9 When King [[H4428]] Tou [[H8583]] of Hamath [[H2574]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] had defeated [[H5221]] the entire [[H3605]] army [[H2426]] of Hadadezer [[H1909]] king [[H4428]] of Zobah, [[H6678]] 
10 he sent [[H7971]] his son [[H1121]] Hadoram [[H1913]] to greet [[H7592]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] and bless him [[H1288]] for [[H5921]] fighting [[H3898]] against Hadadezer [[H1909]] and defeating him. [[H5221]] For [[H3588]] Tou [[H8583]] and Hadadezer [[H1909]] had been [[H1961]] at war. [[H4421]] Hadoram brought all kinds [[H3605]] of articles [[H3627]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] and bronze, [[H5178]] 
11 and [[H1571]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] dedicated [[H6942]] these [[H853]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] along with [[H5973]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] he had carried off [[H5375]] from all [[H3605]] [these] nations— [[H1471]] from Edom [[H123]] and Moab, [[H4124]] and from the Ammonites, [[H1121]] Philistines, [[H6430]] and Amalekites. [[H6002]] 
12 Moreover, Abishai [[H52]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] struck down [[H5221]] eighteen [[H8083]] thousand [[H505]] Edomites [[H123]] in the Valley [[H1516]] of Salt. [[H4417]] 
13 He placed [[H7760]] garrisons [[H5333]] in Edom, [[H123]] and all [[H3605]] the Edomites [[H123]] were [[H1961]] subject [[H5650]] to David. [[H1732]] So the LORD [[H3068]] made David [[H1732]] victorious [[H3467]] wherever [[H3605]] he went. [[H1980]] 
14 Thus David [[H1732]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] administering [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6666]] for all [[H3605]] his people: [[H5971]] 
15 Joab [[H3097]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] was over [[H5921]] the army; [[H6635]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] son [[H1121]] of Ahilud [[H286]] [was] the historian; [[H2142]] 
16 Zadok [[H6659]] son [[H1121]] of Ahitub [[H285]] and Ahimelech [[H40]] son [[H1121]] of Abiathar [[H54]] were priests; [[H3548]] Shavsha [[H7798]] [was] the scribe; [[H5608]] 
17 Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] was over [[H5921]] the Kerethites [[H3774]] and Pelethites; [[H6432]] and David’s [[H1732]] sons [[H1121]] were chief officials [[H7223]] at the king’s [[H4428]] side. [[H3027]]
