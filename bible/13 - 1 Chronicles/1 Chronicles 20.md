1 In the spring, [[H6256]] at the time when [[H6256]] kings [[H4428]] march out to war, [[H3318]] Joab [[H3097]] led out [[H5090]] the army [[H2426]] and laid waste [[H7843]] to the land [[H776]] of the Ammonites. [[H1121]] He came [[H935]] to Rabbah [[H7237]] and besieged it, [[H6696]] but David [[H1732]] remained [[H3427]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Joab [[H3097]] attacked [[H5221]] Rabbah [[H7237]] and demolished it. [[H2040]] 
2 Then David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] the crown [[H5850]] from [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of their king. [[H4428]] It was found [[H4672]] to weigh [[H4948]] a talent [[H3603]] of gold [[H2091]] and was set with precious  stones, [[H68]] and it was [[H1961]] placed on [[H5921]] David’s [[H1732]] head. [[H7218]] And David took [[H3318]] a great amount [[H7235]] of plunder [[H7998]] from the city. [[H5892]] 
3 [David] brought out [[H3318]] the people [[H5971]] who [were] [[H834]] there  and put [them to work] [[H7787]] with saws, [[H4050]] iron [[H1270]] picks, [[H2757]] and axes. [[H4050]] And [he] [[H1732]] did [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] to all [[H3605]] the Ammonite [[H1121]] cities. [[H5892]] Then [David] [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] his troops [[H5971]] returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
4 Some time later, [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] broke out [[H5975]] with [[H5973]] the Philistines [[H6430]] at Gezer. [[H1507]] At that time [[H227]] Sibbecai [[H5444]] the Hushathite [[H2843]] killed [[H5221]] Sippai, [[H5598]] a descendant [[H3211]] of the Rephaim, [[H7497]] and the Philistines were subdued. [[H3665]] 
5 Once again [[H5750]] there was [[H1961]] a battle [[H4421]] with [[H854]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and Elhanan [[H445]] son [[H1121]] of Jair [[H3265]] killed [[H5221]] Lahmi [[H3902]] the brother [[H251]] of Goliath [[H1555]] the Gittite, [[H1663]] the shaft [[H6086]] of whose spear [[H2595]] was like a weaver’s [[H707]] beam. [[H4500]] 
6 And there was [[H1961]] still another [[H5750]] battle [[H4421]] at Gath, [[H1661]] where there was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] of [great] stature [[H4060]] with six [[H8337]] fingers on each hand [[H676]] and six [toes on each foot]— [[H8337]] twenty-four in all. [[H6242]] He [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] was descended [[H3205]] from Rapha, [[H7497]] 
7 and when he taunted [[H2778]] Israel, [[H3478]] Jonathan [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of David’s [[H1732]] brother [[H251]] Shimei [[H8092]] killed him. [[H5221]] 
8 So these [[H411]] descendants [[H3205]] of Rapha [[H7497]] in Gath [[H1661]] fell [[H5307]] at the hands [[H3027]] of David [[H1732]] and his servants. [[H5650]]
