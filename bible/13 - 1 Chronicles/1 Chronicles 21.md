1 Then Satan [[H7854]] rose up [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] and incited [[H5496]] David [[H1732]] to take a census [[H4487]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
2 So David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joab [[H3097]] and the commanders [[H8269]] of the troops, [[H5971]] “Go, [[H1980]] count [[H5608]] the Israelites [[H3478]] from  Beersheba [[H884]] to [[H5704]] Dan [[H1835]] and bring [[H935]] me [[H413]] a report, [[H413]] so that I may know [[H3045]] their number.” [[H4557]] 
3 But Joab [[H3097]] replied, [[H559]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] multiply [[H3254]] His troops [[H5971]] a hundred [[H3967]] times [[H6471]] over. [[H1992]] My lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] are they not [[H3808]] all [[H3605]] servants [[H5650]] of my lord? [[H113]] Why [[H4100]] does my lord [[H113]] want [[H1245]] to do this? [[H2063]] Why [[H4100]] should he bring [[H1961]] guilt [[H819]] on Israel? [[H3478]] 
4 Nevertheless, the king's [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] prevailed [[H2388]] against [[H5921]] Joab. [[H3097]] So Joab [[H3097]] left [[H3318]] and traveled [[H1980]] throughout [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and then he returned [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
5 And Joab [[H3097]] reported [[H5414]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] the total [[H4557]] number [[H4662]] of the troops. [[H5971]] In all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] there were [[H1961]] 1,100,000 [[H505]] men [[H376]] who drew [[H8025]] the sword, [[H2719]] including 470,000 [[H702]] in Judah. [[H3063]] 
6 But [Joab] did not [[H3808]] include [[H6485]] Levi [[H3878]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] in the count, [[H8432]] because [[H3588]] the king’s [[H4428]] command [[H1697]] was detestable [[H8581]] to [[H854]] him. [[H3097]] 
7 This [[H2088]] command [[H1697]] was also evil [[H7489]] in the sight [[H5869]] of God; [[H430]] so He struck [[H5221]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
8 Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] “I have sinned [[H2398]] greatly [[H3966]] because [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]] Now [[H6258]] I beg You [[H4994]] to take away [[H5674]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of Your servant, [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I have acted very [[H3966]] foolishly.” [[H5528]] 
9 And the LORD [[H3068]] instructed [[H1696]] Gad, [[H1410]] David’s [[H1732]] seer, [[H2374]] 
10 “Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H1696]] David [[H1732]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I [[H589]] am offering [[H5186]] you three [options]. [[H7969]] Choose [[H977]] one [[H259]] of them, [[H2007]] and I will carry it out [[H6213]] against you.’”  
11 So Gad [[H1410]] went [[H935]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Take your choice [[H6901]] 
12 of either [[H518]] three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] of famine, [[H7458]] three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] of being swept away [[H5595]] before [[H6440]] your enemies [[H6862]] and overtaken [[H5381]] by their swords, [[H2719]] or [[H518]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] of the sword [[H2719]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] days of plague [[H1698]] upon the land, [[H776]] with the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] ravaging [[H7843]] every [[H3605]] part [[H1366]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Now then, [[H6258]] decide [[H7200]] how [[H4100]] I should reply [[H1697]] to Him who sent me. [[H7971]] 
13 David [[H1732]] answered [[H559]] Gad, [[H1410]] “I am deeply distressed. [[H6862]] Please, [[H4994]] let me fall [[H5307]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] His mercies [are] [[H7356]] very [[H3966]] great; [[H7227]] but do not [[H408]] let me fall [[H5307]] into the hands [[H3027]] of men.” [[H120]] 
14 So the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H5414]] a plague [[H1698]] on Israel, [[H3478]] and seventy [[H7657]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] fell dead. [[H5307]] 
15 Then God [[H430]] sent [[H7971]] an angel [[H4397]] to destroy [[H7843]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] but as the angel was doing so [[H7843]] the LORD [[H3068]] saw it [[H7200]] and relented [[H5162]] from [[H5921]] the calamity, [[H7451]] and He said [[H559]] to the angel [[H4397]] who was destroying the people, [[H7843]] “Enough, [[H7227]] withdraw [[H7503]] your hand [[H3027]] now!” [[H6258]] At that time the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was standing [[H5975]] by [[H5973]] the threshing floor [[H1637]] of Ornan [[H771]] the Jebusite. [[H2983]] 
16 When David [[H1732]] lifted [[H5375]] up his eyes [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] standing [[H5975]] between [[H996]] heaven [[H8064]] and [[H996]] earth, [[H776]] with his drawn [[H8025]] sword [[H2719]] in his hand [[H3027]] stretched out [[H5186]] over [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] David [[H1732]] and the elders, [[H2205]] clothed [[H3680]] in sackcloth, [[H8242]] fell [[H5307]] facedown, [[H6440]] 
17 and David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] “Was it not [[H3808]] I [[H589]] who gave the order [[H559]] to count [[H4487]] the people? [[H5971]] I, [the shepherd], [[H589]] am the one [[H1931]] who [[H834]] has sinned [[H2398]] and [[H7489]] acted wickedly. [[H7489]] But these [[H428]] sheep, [[H6629]] what [[H4100]] have they done? [[H6213]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] please [[H4994]] let Your hand [[H3027]] fall upon [[H1961]] me  and my fathers [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] but do not [[H3808]] let this plague [[H4046]] remain upon Your people. [[H5971]] 
18 Then the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] ordered [[H559]] Gad [[H1410]] to tell [[H559]] David [[H1732]] to go up [[H5927]] and build [[H6965]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on the threshing floor [[H1637]] of Ornan [[H771]] the Jebusite. [[H2983]] 
19 So David [[H1732]] went up [[H5927]] at the word [[H1697]] that Gad [[H1410]] had spoken [[H1696]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
20 Now Ornan [[H771]] was threshing [[H1758]] wheat [[H2406]] when he [[H771]] turned [[H7725]] and saw [[H7200]] the angel; [[H4397]] and his four [[H702]] sons [[H1121]] who were with him [[H5973]] hid themselves. [[H2244]] 
21 David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Ornan, [[H771]] and when Ornan [[H771]] looked out [[H5027]] and saw [[H7200]] David, [[H1732]] he left [[H3318]] the threshing floor [[H1637]] and bowed [[H7812]] facedown [[H639]] before David. [[H1732]] 
22 Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ornan, [[H771]] “Grant [[H5414]] me  the site [[H4725]] of this threshing floor, [[H1637]] that I may build [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Sell it [[H5414]] to me  for the full [[H4392]] price, [[H3701]] so that the plague [[H4046]] on [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] may be halted.” [[H6113]] 
23 Ornan [[H771]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “My lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] may take [[H3947]] whatever [seems] good. [[H6213]] Look, [[H7200]] I will give [[H5414]] the oxen [[H1241]] for the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] the threshing sledges [[H4173]] for the wood, [[H6086]] and the wheat [[H2406]] for the grain offering— [[H4503]] I will give [[H5414]] it all.” [[H3605]] 
24 “No,” [[H3808]] replied [[H559]] King [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] “I insist on paying [[H7069]] the full [[H4392]] price, [[H3701]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] take [[H5375]] for the LORD [[H3068]] what [[H834]] belongs to you  or offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] that cost me nothing.” [[H2600]] 
25 So David [[H1732]] paid [[H5414]] Ornan [[H771]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] shekels [[H8255]] of gold [[H2091]] for the site. [[H4725]] 
26 And [[H1732]] there [[H8033]] he built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings. [[H8002]] He called [[H7121]] upon [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who answered him [[H6030]] with fire [[H784]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering. [[H5930]] 
27 Then the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H559]] to the angel, [[H4397]] who put his sword [[H2719]] back [[H7725]] into [[H413]] its sheath. [[H5084]] 
28 At that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] when David [[H1732]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had answered him [[H6030]] at the threshing floor [[H1637]] of Ornan [[H771]] the Jebusite, [[H2983]] he offered sacrifices [[H2076]] there. [[H8033]] 
29 For the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had made [[H6213]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] and the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] were presently [[H6256]] at the high place [[H1116]] in Gibeon, [[H1391]] 
30 but David [[H1732]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] before it [[H6440]] to inquire [[H1875]] of God, [[H430]] because [[H3588]] he was afraid [[H1204]] of [[H6440]] the sword [[H2719]] of the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
