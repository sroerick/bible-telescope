6 Naarah [[H5292]] bore [[H3205]] to him  Ahuzzam, [[H275]] Hepher, [[H2660]] Temeni, [[H8488]] and Haahashtari. [[H326]] These [[H428]] were the descendants [[H1121]] of Naarah. [[H5292]]

9 Now Jabez [[H3258]] was [[H1961]] more honorable [[H3513]] than his brothers. [[H251]] His mother [[H517]] had named [[H7121]] him Jabez, [[H3258]] saying, [[H559]] “Because [[H3588]] I bore [him] [[H3205]] in pain.” [[H6090]] 
10 And Jabez [[H3258]] called out [[H7121]] to the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “If only [[H518]] You would bless me [[H1288]] and enlarge [[H7235]] my territory! [[H1366]] May Your hand [[H3027]] be [[H1961]] with me [[H5973]] and keep me [[H6213]] from harm, [[H7451]] so that I will be free [[H1115]] from pain.” [[H6087]] And God [[H430]] granted [[H935]] the request [[H7592]] of [Jabez]. [[H853]]

15 The sons [[H1121]] of Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh: [[H3312]] Iru, [[H5900]] Elah, [[H425]] and Naam. [[H5277]] The son [[H1121]] of Elah: [[H425]] Kenaz. [[H7073]]

18 These [[H428]] were the sons [[H1121]] of Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] daughter [[H1323]] Bithiah. [[H1332]] Mered also [[H4778]] took [[H3947]] a Judean [[H3057]] wife, [[H802]] who gave birth to [[H3205]] Jered [[H3382]] the father [[H1]] of Gedor, [[H1446]] Heber [[H2268]] the father [[H1]] of Soco, [[H7755]] and Jekuthiel [[H3354]] the father [[H1]] of Zanoah. [[H2182]]

23 These [were] [[H1992]] the potters [[H3335]] who lived [[H3427]] at Netaim [[H5196]] and Gederah. [[H1449]] They lived [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] in the service [[H4399]] of the king. [[H4428]] 
24 The descendants [[H1121]] of Simeon: [[H8095]] Nemuel, [[H5241]] Jamin, [[H3226]] Jarib, [[H3402]] Zerah, [[H2226]] and Shaul. [[H7586]]

26 The sons [[H1121]] of Mishma: [[H4927]] Hammuel, [[H2536]] Zaccur, [[H2139]] and Shimei. [[H8096]] 
27 Shimei [[H8096]] had sixteen [[H8337]] sons [[H1121]] and six [[H8337]] daughters, [[H1323]] but his brothers [[H251]] did not [[H369]] have many [[H7227]] children, [[H1121]] so their whole [[H3605]] clan [[H4940]] did not [[H3808]] become as numerous [[H7235]] as [[H5704]] the sons [[H1121]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
28 They lived [[H3427]] in Beersheba, [[H884]] Moladah, [[H4137]] Hazar-shual, [[H2705]] 
29 Bilhah, [[H1090]] Ezem, [[H6107]] Tolad, [[H8434]] 
30 Bethuel, [[H1328]] Hormah, [[H2767]] Ziklag, [[H6860]] 
31 Beth-marcaboth, [[H1024]] Hazar-susim, [[H2702]] Beth-biri, [[H1011]] and Shaaraim. [[H8189]] These [[H428]] were their cities [[H5892]] until [[H5704]] the reign [[H4427]] of David. [[H1732]] 
32 And their villages [[H2691]] were Etam, [[H5862]] Ain, [[H5871]] Rimmon, [[H7417]] Tochen, [[H8507]] and Ashan— [[H6228]] five [[H2568]] [towns]— [[H5892]] 
33 and all [[H3605]] their surrounding [[H5439]] villages [[H2691]] as [[H5704]] far as Baal. [[H1168]] These [[H2063]] were their settlements, [[H4186]] and they kept a genealogical record: [[H3187]] 
34 Meshobab, [[H4877]] Jamlech, [[H3230]] Joshah [[H3144]] son [[H1121]] of Amaziah, [[H558]] 
35 Joel, [[H3100]] Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Joshibiah, [[H3143]] the son [[H1121]] of Seraiah, [[H8304]] the son [[H1121]] of Asiel, [[H6221]] 
36 Elioenai, [[H454]] Jaakobah, [[H3291]] Jeshohaiah, [[H3439]] Asaiah, [[H6222]] Adiel, [[H5717]] Jesimiel, [[H3450]] Benaiah, [[H1141]] 
37 and Ziza [[H2124]] son [[H1121]] of Shiphi, [[H8230]] the son [[H1121]] of Allon, [[H438]] the son [[H1121]] of Jedaiah, [[H3042]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimri, [[H8113]] the son [[H1121]] of Shemaiah. [[H8098]] 
38 These men [[H428]] noted [[H935]] by name [[H8034]] [were] the leaders [[H5387]] of their clans. [[H4940]] Their families [[H1]] increased [[H6555]] greatly, [[H7230]] 
39 and they journeyed [[H1980]] to the entrance [[H3996]] of Gedor, [[H1446]] to the east side [[H4217]] of the valley, [[H1516]] in search of [[H1245]] pasture [[H4829]] for their flocks. [[H6629]] 
40 There they found [[H4672]] rich, [[H8082]] good [[H2896]] pasture, [[H4829]] and the land [[H776]] was spacious, [[H7342]] peaceful, [[H8252]] and quiet, [[H7961]] for [[H3588]] some [[H4480]] Hamites [[H2526]] had lived [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] formerly. [[H6440]] 
41 These [[H428]] who were noted [[H3789]] by name [[H8034]] came [[H935]] in the days [[H3117]] of Hezekiah [[H2396]] king of [[H4428]] Judah. [[H3063]] They attacked [the Hamites] [[H5221]] and Meunites [[H4586]] there [[H8033]] in their dwellings, [[H168]] and they utterly destroyed them [[H2763]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] Then they settled [[H3427]] in their place, [[H8478]] because [[H3588]] there was pasture [[H4829]] for their flocks. [[H6629]] 
42 And [[H1992]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] of these Simeonites [[H8095]] led by [[H7218]] Pelatiah, [[H6410]] Neariah, [[H5294]] Rephaiah, [[H7509]] and Uzziel, [[H5816]] the sons [[H1121]] of Ishi, [[H3469]] went [[H1980]] to the hill country [[H2022]] of Seir [[H8165]] 
43 and struck down [[H5221]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the Amalekites [[H6002]] who had escaped. [[H6413]] And they have lived [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]
