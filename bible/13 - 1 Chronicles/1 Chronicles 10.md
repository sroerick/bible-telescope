1 Now the Philistines [[H6430]] fought [[H3898]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and the Israelites [[H3478]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] them, [[H6430]] and [many] fell [[H5307]] slain [[H2491]] on Mount [[H2022]] Gilboa. [[H1533]] 
2 The Philistines [[H6430]] followed hard after [[H1692]] Saul [[H7586]] and his sons, [[H1121]] and they killed [[H5221]] Saul’s [[H7586]] sons [[H1121]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] Abinadab, [[H41]] and Malchishua. [[H4444]] 
3 When the battle [[H4421]] intensified [[H3513]] against [[H5921]] Saul, [[H7586]] the archers [[H3384]] overtook him [[H4672]] and wounded him [[H2342]] critically. [[H3384]] 
4 Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his armor-bearer, [[H5375]] “Draw [[H8025]] your sword [[H2719]] and run it through me, [[H1856]] or [[H6435]] these [[H428]] uncircumcised men [[H6189]] will come [[H935]] and torture me!” [[H5953]] But his armor-bearer [[H5375]] refused, [[H3808]] because [[H3588]] he was terrified. [[H3372]] So Saul [[H7586]] took [[H3947]] his own sword [[H2719]] and fell [[H5307]] on it. [[H5921]] 
5 When his armor-bearer [[H5375]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] was dead, [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] his own sword [[H2719]] and died. [[H4191]] 
6 So Saul [[H7586]] died [[H4191]] together [[H3162]] with his three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] his house. [[H1004]] 
7 When all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H376]] in the valley [[H6010]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the army had fled [[H5127]] and that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] and his sons [[H1121]] had died, [[H4191]] they abandoned [[H5800]] their cities [[H5892]] and ran away. [[H5127]] So the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H935]] and occupied [[H3427]] them.  
8 The next day, [[H4283]] when the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H935]] to strip [[H6584]] the dead, [[H2491]] they found [[H4672]] Saul [[H7586]] and his sons [[H1121]] fallen [[H5307]] on Mount [[H2022]] Gilboa. [[H1533]] 
9 They stripped Saul, [[H6584]] cut off his head, [[H7218]] took [[H5375]] his armor, [[H3627]] and sent [[H7971]] messengers throughout the land [[H776]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] to proclaim the news [[H1319]] [in the temple] of their idols [[H6091]] and among their people. [[H5971]] 
10 They put [[H7760]] his armor [[H3627]] in the temple [[H1004]] of their gods [[H430]] and hung [[H8628]] his head [[H1538]] in the temple [[H1004]] of Dagon. [[H1712]] 
11 When the people of [[H3605]] Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] heard [[H8085]] about everything [[H3605]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had done [[H6213]] to Saul, [[H7586]] 
12 all [[H3605]] their valiant warriors [[H376]] set out [[H6965]] and retrieved [[H5375]] the bodies [[H1480]] of Saul [[H7586]] and [[H853]] his sons [[H1121]] and brought [[H935]] them to Jabesh. [[H3003]] And they buried [[H6912]] their bones [[H6106]] under [[H8478]] the oak [[H424]] in Jabesh [[H3003]] and fasted [[H6684]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
13 So Saul [[H7586]] died [[H4191]] for his unfaithfulness [[H4603]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] because [[H834]] he did not [[H3808]] keep [[H8104]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and even [[H1571]] consulted [[H7592]] a medium [[H178]] for guidance, [[H1875]] 
14 and he failed [[H3808]] to inquire [[H1875]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] So the LORD put him to death [[H4191]] and turned the kingdom [[H4410]] over [[H5437]] to David [[H1732]] son [[H1121]] of Jesse. [[H3448]]
