1 Then David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] is the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] and this [[H2088]] is the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] for Israel.” [[H3478]] 
2 So David [[H1732]] gave orders [[H559]] to gather [[H3664]] the foreigners [[H1616]] in the land [[H776]] of Israel, [[H3478]] from whom he appointed [[H5975]] stonecutters [[H2672]] to prepare [[H2672]] finished [[H1496]] stones [[H68]] for building [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]] 
3 David [[H1732]] provided [[H3559]] a large quantity of [[H7230]] iron [[H1270]] to make the nails [[H4548]] for the doors [[H1817]] of the gateways [[H8179]] and for the fittings, [[H4226]] together with more [[H7230]] bronze [[H5178]] than could be weighed [[H4948]] 
4 and more [[H4557]] cedar [[H730]] logs [[H6086]] than could be counted; [[H369]] for [[H3588]] the Sidonians [[H6722]] and Tyrians [[H6876]] had brought [[H935]] a large quantity of [[H7230]] cedar [[H730]] logs [[H6086]] to David. [[H1732]] 
5 And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “My son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] is young [[H5288]] and inexperienced, [[H7390]] and the house [[H1004]] to be built [[H1129]] for the LORD [[H3068]] must be exceedingly [[H4605]] magnificent— [[H1431]] famous [[H8034]] and glorious [[H8597]] throughout all [[H3605]] the lands. [[H776]] Therefore [[H4994]] I must make provision [[H3559]] for it.”  So David [[H1732]] made lavish [[H7230]] preparations [[H3559]] for it before [[H6440]] his death. [[H4194]] 
6 Then [David] called for [[H7121]] his son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] and instructed [[H6680]] him to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
7 “My son,” [[H1121]] said [[H559]] David [[H1732]] to Solomon, [[H8010]] “it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] my heart [[H3824]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] 
8 but this word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me: [[H5921]] ‘You have shed [[H8210]] much [[H7230]] blood [[H1818]] and waged [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] wars. [[H4421]] You are not [[H3808]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for My Name [[H8034]] because [[H3588]] you have shed [[H8210]] so much [[H7227]] blood [[H1818]] on the ground [[H776]] before Me. [[H6440]] 
9 But [[H2009]] a son [[H1121]] will be born [[H3205]] to you  who [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] of rest. [[H4496]] I will give him rest [[H5117]] from all [[H3605]] his enemies [[H341]] on every side; [[H5439]] for [[H3588]] his name [[H8034]] will be [[H1961]] Solomon, [[H8010]] and I will grant [[H5414]] to [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] peace [[H7965]] and quiet [[H8253]] during his reign. [[H3117]] 
10 He [[H1931]] is the one who will build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for My Name. [[H8034]] He [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] My son, [[H1121]] and I [will be] [[H589]] his  Father. [[H1]] And I will establish [[H3559]] the throne [[H3678]] of his kingdom [[H4438]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] forever.’ [[H5704]] 
11 Now, [[H6258]] my son, [[H1121]] may the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with you, [[H5973]] and may you succeed [[H6743]] in building [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] He said [[H1696]] you would. [[H5921]] 
12 Above all, [[H389]] may the LORD [[H3068]] give [[H5414]] you insight [[H7922]] and understanding [[H998]] when He puts you in command [[H6680]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] so that you may keep [[H8104]] the law [[H8451]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
13 Then [[H227]] you will succeed, [[H6743]] if [[H518]] you carefully [[H8104]] follow [[H6213]] the statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] for [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous. [[H553]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or discouraged. [[H2865]] 
14 Now behold, [[H2009]] I have taken great pains [[H6040]] to provide [[H3559]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] 100,000 {} [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]] 1,000,000 {} [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] and bronze [[H5178]] and iron [[H1270]] too great [[H3588]] to be weighed. [[H4948]] I have also provided [[H3559]] timber [[H6086]] and stone, [[H68]] but you will need to add [[H3254]] to them. [[H5921]] 
15 You also have [[H5973]] many [[H7230]] workers: [[H6213]] stonecutters, [[H2672]] masons, [[H2796]] carpenters, [[H6086]] and men skilled [[H2450]] in every kind [[H3605]] of work— [[H4399]] 
16 in gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] bronze [[H5178]] and iron— [[H1270]] [craftsmen] beyond [[H369]] number. [[H4557]] Now begin [[H6965]] the work, [[H6213]] and may the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with you.” [[H5973]] 
17 Then David [[H1732]] ordered [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H8269]] of Israel [[H3478]] to help [[H5826]] his son [[H1121]] Solomon: [[H8010]] 
18 “[Is] not [[H3808]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] with you, [[H5973]] and has He not granted you rest [[H5117]] on every side? [[H5439]] For [[H3588]] He has given [[H5414]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] into my hand, [[H3027]] and the land [[H776]] has been subdued [[H3533]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] and His people. [[H5971]] 
19 Now [[H6258]] set [[H5414]] your heart [[H3824]] and soul [[H5315]] to seek [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] Get started [[H6965]] building [[H1129]] the sanctuary [[H4720]] of the LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] so that you may bring [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and the holy [[H6944]] articles [[H3627]] of God [[H430]] into the temple [[H1004]] that will be built [[H1129]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
