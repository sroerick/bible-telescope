1 [These were] the divisions [[H4256]] of the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron. [[H175]] The sons [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] were Nadab, [[H5070]] Abihu, [[H30]] Eleazar, [[H499]] and Ithamar. [[H385]] 
2 But Nadab [[H5070]] and Abihu [[H30]] died [[H4191]] before [[H6440]] their father did, [[H1]] and they had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] sons; [[H1121]] so Eleazar [[H499]] and Ithamar [[H385]] served as priests. [[H3547]] 
3 With the help of Eleazar's [[H499]] descendant [[H1121]] Zadok [[H6659]] and Ithamar's [[H385]] descendant [[H1121]] Ahimelech, [[H288]] David [[H1732]] divided them [[H2505]] according to the offices [[H6486]] of their service. [[H5656]] 
4 Since more [[H7227]] leaders [[H7218]] were found [[H4672]] among Eleazar's [[H499]] descendants [[H1121]] than [[H4480]] [those] [[H1121]] of Ithamar, [[H385]] they were divided accordingly. [[H2505]] [There were] sixteen [[H8337]] heads [[H7218]] of families [[H1]] from the descendants [[H1121]] of Eleazar [[H499]] and eight [[H8083]] from the descendants [[H1121]] of Ithamar. [[H385]] 
5 Thus they were divided [[H2505]] by lot, [[H1486]] for [[H3588]] there were [[H1961]] officers [[H8269]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] and officers [[H8269]] of God [[H430]] among both Eleazar’s [[H499]] and Ithamar’s [[H385]] descendants. [[H1121]] 
6 The secretary, [[H5608]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] son [[H1121]] of Nethanel, [[H5417]] a Levite, [[H3881]] recorded [their names] [[H3789]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the king [[H4428]] and the officers [[H8269]] Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] Ahimelech [[H288]] son [[H1121]] of Abiathar, [[H54]] and the heads [[H7218]] of families [[H1]] of the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites— [[H3881]] one [[H259]] family [[H1]] being taken [[H270]] from Eleazar, [[H499]] and then one [[H270]] from Ithamar. [[H385]]
