1 After [[H1961]] David [[H1732]] had settled [[H3427]] into his palace, [[H1004]] he [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] “Here [[H2009]] I am, [[H595]] living [[H3427]] in a house [[H1004]] of cedar, [[H729]] while the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is under [[H8478]] a tent.” [[H3407]] 
2 So Nathan [[H5416]] told [[H559]] David, [[H1732]] “Do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [is] [[H834]] in your heart, [[H3824]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] is with you.” [[H5973]] 
3 But that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] the word [[H1697]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Nathan, [[H5416]] saying, [[H559]] 
4 “Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] You [[H859]] are not [[H3808]] the one to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for Me  to dwell in. [[H3427]] 
5 For [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] dwelt [[H3427]] in a house [[H1004]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] I brought [[H5927]] Israel up [from Egypt] [[H3478]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] but I have moved [[H1961]] from tent [[H168]] to [[H413]] tent [[H168]] and dwelling to dwelling. [[H4908]] 
6 In all [[H3605]] My journeys [[H1980]] with all [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H3478]] have I ever asked [[H1696]] any [[H259]] [of the leaders] [[H8199]] of Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] to shepherd [[H7462]] My people, [[H5971]] ‘Why [[H4100]] have you not [[H3808]] built [[H1129]] Me  a house [[H1004]] of cedar?’ [[H729]] 
7 Now [[H6258]] then, [[H3541]] you are to tell [[H559]] My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] that  this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] I [[H589]] took [[H3947]] you from [[H4480]] the pasture, [[H5116]] from [[H4480]] following [[H310]] the flock, [[H6629]] to be [[H1961]] the ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
8 I have been [[H1961]] with you [[H5973]] wherever [[H834]] you have gone, [[H1980]] and I have cut off [[H3772]] all [[H3605]] your enemies [[H341]] before you. [[H6440]] Now I will make [[H6213]] for you  a name [[H8034]] like [[H8034]] the greatest [[H1419]] in the land. [[H776]] 
9 And I will provide [[H7760]] a place [[H4725]] for My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] and will plant them [[H5193]] so that they may dwell in [[H7931]] a place of their own [[H8478]] and be disturbed [[H7264]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]] No [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] will the sons [[H1121]] of wickedness [[H5766]] oppress them [[H1086]] as they did [[H834]] at the beginning [[H7223]] 
10 and [have done] since the day [[H3117]] I appointed [[H6680]] judges [[H8199]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] And I will subdue [[H3665]] all [[H3605]] your enemies. [[H341]] Moreover, I declare [[H5046]] to you  that the LORD [[H3068]] will build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for you.  
11 And [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] your days [[H3117]] are fulfilled [[H4390]] and you go [to be] [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] your fathers, [[H1]] I will raise up [[H6965]] your offspring [[H2233]] after you, [[H310]] one of your own sons, [[H1121]] and I will establish [[H3559]] his kingdom. [[H4438]] 
12 He [[H1931]] will build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for Me,  and I will establish [[H3559]] his throne [[H3678]] forever. [[H5704]] 
13 I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] his  Father, [[H1]] and he [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] My  son. [[H1121]] And My loving devotion [[H2617]] will never [[H3808]] depart [[H5493]] from him [[H5973]] as [[H834]] I removed [it] [[H5493]] from your predecessor. [[H834]] 
14 But I will set him [[H5975]] over My house [[H1004]] and My kingdom [[H4438]] forever, [[H5704]] and his throne [[H3678]] will be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] forever.” [[H5704]] 
15 According to all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] and this [[H2088]] entire [[H3605]] vision, [[H2377]] so [[H3651]] Nathan [[H5416]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] David. [[H1732]] 
16 Then King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] went in, [[H935]] sat [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] am I, [[H589]] O LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] and what [[H4310]] is my house, [[H1004]] that [[H3588]] You have brought me [[H935]] this far? [[H1988]] 
17 And as if this [[H2063]] was a small thing [[H6994]] in Your eyes, [[H5869]] O God, [[H430]] You have spoken [[H1696]] about [[H5921]] the future [[H7350]] of the house [[H1004]] of Your servant [[H5650]] and have regarded me [[H7200]] as a man [[H120]] of great distinction, [[H4609]] O LORD [[H3068]] God. [[H430]] 
18 What [[H4100]] more [[H3254]] can David [[H1732]] say to You [[H413]] for so honoring [[H3519]] Your servant? [[H5650]] For You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] Your servant. [[H5650]] 
19 O LORD, [[H3068]] for the sake [[H5668]] of Your servant [[H5650]] and according to Your own heart, [[H3820]] You have accomplished [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] great thing [[H1420]] and revealed [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] Your greatness. [[H1420]] 
20 O LORD, [[H3068]] [there is] none [[H369]] like You, [[H3644]] and [there is] no [[H369]] God [[H430]] besides You, [[H2108]] according to everything [[H3605]] we have heard [[H8085]] with our own ears. [[H241]] 
21 And who [[H4310]] is like Your people [[H5971]] Israel— [[H3478]] the one [[H259]] nation [[H1471]] on earth [[H776]] whom [[H834]] God [[H430]] went out [[H1980]] to redeem [[H6299]] as a people [[H5971]] for Himself,  to make [[H7760]] a name [[H8034]] for Yourself  through great [[H1420]] and awesome wonders [[H3372]] by driving out [[H1644]] nations [[H1471]] from before [[H6440]] Your people, [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] You redeemed [[H6299]] from Egypt? [[H4714]] 
22 For You have made [[H5414]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] Your very own  forever, [[H5704]] and You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] have become [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]] 
23 And now, [[H6258]] O LORD, [[H3068]] let the word [[H1697]] You have spoken [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] Your servant [[H5650]] and his house [[H1004]] be established [[H539]] forever. [[H5704]] Do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] You have promised, [[H1696]] 
24 so that Your name [[H8034]] will be established [[H539]] and magnified [[H1431]] forever [[H5704]] when it is said, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] is God [[H430]] over Israel.’ [[H3478]] And may the house [[H1004]] of Your servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] be established [[H3559]] before You. [[H6440]] 
25 For [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] my God, [[H430]] have revealed [[H1540]] to Your servant [[H5650]] that You will build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for him.  Therefore [[H3651]] Your servant [[H5650]] has found the courage [[H4672]] to pray [[H6419]] before You. [[H6440]] 
26 And now, [[H6258]] O LORD, [[H3068]] You [[H859]] are [[H1931]] God! [[H430]] And You have promised [[H1696]] this [[H2063]] goodness [[H2896]] to [[H5921]] Your servant. [[H5650]] 
27 So now [[H6258]] You have been pleased [[H2974]] to bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Your servant, [[H5650]] that it may continue [[H1961]] forever [[H5769]] before You. [[H6440]] For [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] have blessed it, [[H1288]] and [it will be] blessed [[H1288]] forever.” [[H5769]]
