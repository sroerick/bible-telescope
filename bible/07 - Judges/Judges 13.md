# Judges 13
[[Judges 12|←]] • [[Judges 14|→]]
1 Again [[H3254]] the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] so the LORD [[H3068]] delivered them [[H5414]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] for forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]] 
2 Now there was [[H1961]] a [[H259]] man [[H376]] from Zorah [[H6881]] named [[H8034]] Manoah, [[H4495]] from the clan [[H4940]] of the Danites, [[H1839]] whose wife [was] [[H802]] barren [[H6135]] and had no [[H3808]] children. [[H3205]] 
3 The Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] and said [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] “It is true [[H2009]] that you [[H859]] are barren [[H6135]] and have no [[H3808]] children; [[H3205]] but you will conceive [[H2029]] and give birth to [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] 
4 Now [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] be careful [[H8104]] not [[H408]] to drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] or strong drink, [[H7941]] and not [[H408]] to eat [[H398]] anything [[H3605]] unclean. [[H2931]] 
5 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] you will conceive [[H2029]] and give birth to [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] And no [[H3808]] razor [[H4177]] shall come [[H5927]] over [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] because [[H3588]] the boy [[H5288]] will be [[H1961]] a Nazirite, set apart [[H5139]] to God [[H430]] from [[H4480]] the womb, [[H990]] and he [[H1931]] will begin [[H2490]] the deliverance [[H3467]] of Israel [[H3478]] from the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] 
6 Then the woman [[H802]] went [[H935]] and said to [[H559]] her husband, [[H376]] “A Man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to me. [[H413]] His appearance was like [[H4758]] the Angel [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] exceedingly [[H3966]] awesome. [[H3372]] I did not [[H3808]] ask [[H7592]] Him where [[H335]] He came from, [[H2088]] and He did not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] me  His name. [[H8034]] 
7 But He said [[H559]] to me,  ‘Behold, [[H2009]] you will conceive [[H2029]] and give birth to [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] Now, therefore, [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] or strong drink, [[H7941]] and do not [[H408]] eat [[H398]] anything [[H3605]] unclean, [[H2932]] because [[H3588]] the boy [[H5288]] will be [[H1961]] a Nazirite [[H5139]] to God [[H430]] from [[H4480]] the womb [[H990]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of his death. [[H4194]] 
8 Then Manoah [[H4495]] prayed [[H6279]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “Please, [[H994]] O Lord, [[H136]] let the Man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] You sent us [[H7971]] come [[H935]] to us [[H413]] again [[H5750]] to teach us [[H3384]] how [[H4100]] to raise [[H6213]] the boy [[H5288]] who is to be born.” [[H3205]] 
9 And God [[H430]] listened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of Manoah, [[H4495]] and the Angel [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] as she [[H1931]] was sitting [[H3427]] in the field; [[H7704]] but her husband [[H376]] Manoah [[H4495]] was not [[H369]] with her. [[H5973]] 
10 The woman [[H802]] ran [[H7323]] quickly [[H4116]] to tell [[H559]] her husband, [[H376]] “Behold, [[H2009]] the Man [[H376]] who [[H834]] came [[H935]] to me [[H413]] the [other] day [[H3117]] has reappeared!” [[H7200]] 
11 So Manoah [[H4495]] got up [[H6965]] and followed [[H1980]] his wife. [[H802]] When he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the Man, [[H376]] he asked, [[H559]] “Are You [[H859]] the Man [[H376]] who [[H834]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] my wife?” [[H802]] “I [[H589]] am,” He said. [[H559]] 
12 Then Manoah [[H4495]] asked, [[H559]] “When [[H6258]] Your words [[H1697]] come to pass, [[H935]] what [[H4100]] will be [[H1961]] the boy’s [[H5288]] rule of life [[H4941]] and mission?” [[H4639]] 
13 So the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3069]] answered [[H559]] Manoah, [[H4495]] “Your wife [[H802]] needs to do [[H8104]] everything [[H3605]] I told her. [[H559]] 
14 She is not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] anything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] comes [[H3318]] from the vine [[H1612]] or drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] or strong drink. [[H7941]] And she must not [[H408]] eat [[H398]] anything [[H3605]] unclean. [[H2932]] Your wife must do [[H8104]] everything [[H3605]] I have commanded her.” [[H6680]] 
15 “Please [[H4994]] stay here,” [[H6113]] Manoah [[H4495]] said [[H559]] to the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] “and we will prepare [[H6213]] a young goat [[H1423]] for You.” [[H6440]] 
16 And the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] replied, [[H559]] “Even if [[H518]] I stay, [[H6113]] I will not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] your food. [[H3899]] But if [[H518]] you prepare [[H6213]] a burnt offering, [[H5930]] offer [[H5927]] it to the LORD.” [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] Manoah [[H4495]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] He [[H1931]] was the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
17 Then Manoah [[H4495]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Him, [[H4397]] “What [[H4310]] is Your name, [[H8034]] so that we may honor [[H3513]] You when [[H3588]] Your word [[H1697]] comes to pass?” [[H935]] 
18 “Why [[H4100]] do you ask [[H7592]] My name,” [[H8034]] said [[H559]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] “since it [[H1931]] is beyond comprehension?” [[H6383]] 
19 Then Manoah [[H4495]] took [[H3947]] a young goat [[H1423]] and a grain offering [[H4503]] and offered them [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] a rock [[H6697]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and as Manoah [[H4495]] and his wife [[H802]] looked on, [[H7200]] the LORD did [[H6213]] a marvelous thing. [[H6381]] 
20 When the flame [[H3851]] went up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] to the sky, [[H8064]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] ascended [[H5927]] in the [[H4196]] flame. [[H3851]] When Manoah [[H4495]] and his wife [[H802]] saw [this], [[H7200]] they fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H5921]] to the ground. [[H776]] 
21 And when the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] did not [[H3808]] appear [[H7200]] again [[H3254]] to [[H413]] Manoah [[H4495]] and [[H413]] his wife, [[H802]] Manoah [[H4495]] realized [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] was the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
22 “We are going to die,” [[H4191]] he [[H4495]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his wife, [[H802]] “for [[H3588]] we have seen [[H7200]] God!” [[H430]] 
23 But his wife [[H802]] replied, [[H559]] “If [[H3863]] the LORD [[H3068]] had intended [[H2654]] to kill us, [[H4191]] He would not [[H3808]] have accepted [[H3947]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and the grain offering [[H4503]] from our hands, [[H3027]] nor would He [[H3808]] have shown [[H7200]] us all [[H3605]] these things [[H428]] or spoken [[H8085]] to us [[H6256]] this way.” [[H2063]] 
24 So the woman [[H802]] gave birth to [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] and named [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Samson. [[H8123]] The boy [[H5288]] grew, [[H1431]] and the LORD [[H3068]] blessed him. [[H1288]] 
25 And the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] began [[H2490]] to stir him [[H6470]] at Mahaneh [[H4264]] Dan, [[H1835]] between [[H996]] Zorah [[H6881]] and Eshtaol. [[H847]]
