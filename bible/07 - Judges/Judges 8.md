1 Then the men [[H376]] of Ephraim [[H669]] said [[H559]] to [Gideon], [[H413]] “Why [[H4100]] have you done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] to us?  Why did you fail [[H1115]] to call [[H7121]] us  when [[H3588]] you went [[H1980]] to fight [[H3898]] against Midian?” [[H4080]] And they contended [[H7378]] with him violently. [[H854]] 
2 But he said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “What [[H4100]] have I accomplished [[H6213]] now [[H6258]] in comparison with you?  Are not [[H3808]] the gleanings [[H5955]] of Ephraim [[H669]] better [[H2896]] than the grape harvest [[H1210]] of Abiezer? [[H44]] 
3 God [[H430]] has delivered [[H5414]] Oreb [[H6159]] and Zeeb, [[H2062]] the two princes [[H8269]] of Midian, [[H4080]] into your hands. [[H3027]] What [[H4100]] was I able [[H3201]] to do [[H6213]] in comparison with you?”  When he said [[H1696]] this, [[H2088]] their anger [[H7307]] toward him [[H5921]] subsided. [[H7503]] 
4 Then Gideon [[H1439]] and his [[H854]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] came [[H935]] to the Jordan [[H3383]] [and] crossed it, [[H5674]] exhausted [[H5889]] yet still in pursuit. [[H7291]] 
5 So [Gideon] said [[H559]] to the men [[H582]] of Succoth, [[H5523]] “Please [[H4994]] give [[H5414]] my troops [[H5971]] some [[H3603]] bread, [[H3899]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are exhausted, [[H5889]] and I [[H595]] am still pursuing [[H7291]] Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] the kings [[H4428]] of Midian.” [[H4080]] 
6 But the leaders [[H8269]] of Succoth [[H5523]] asked, [[H559]] “[Are] the hands [[H3709]] of Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] already [[H6258]] in your possession, [[H3027]] that [[H3588]] we should give [[H5414]] bread [[H3899]] to your army?” [[H6635]] 
7 “Very well,” [[H3651]] Gideon [[H1439]] replied, [[H559]] “when the LORD [[H3068]] has delivered [[H5414]] Zebah [[H2078]] and [[H853]] Zalmunna [[H6759]] into my hands, [[H3027]] I will tear [[H1758]] your flesh [[H1320]] with [[H854]] the thorns [[H6975]] and briers [[H1303]] of the wilderness!” [[H4057]] 
8 From there [[H8033]] he went up [[H5927]] to Penuel [[H6439]] and asked [[H1696]] the same [[H2063]] from them, [[H413]] but the men [[H376]] of Penuel [[H6439]] gave the same response [[H6030]] as [[H834]] the men [[H376]] of Succoth. [[H5523]] 
9 So [Gideon] [[H1571]] told [[H559]] the men [[H376]] of Penuel, [[H6439]] “When I return [[H7725]] in triumph, [[H7965]] I will tear down [[H5422]] this [[H2088]] tower!” [[H4026]] 
10 Now Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] were in Karkor [[H7174]] with [[H5973]] their army [[H4264]] of about fifteen [[H2568]] thousand [men]— [[H505]] all [[H3605]] that were left [[H3498]] of [[H3605]] the armies [[H4264]] of the people [[H1121]] of the East. [[H6924]] A hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] swordsmen [[H376]] had already fallen. [[H5307]] 
11 And Gideon [[H1439]] went up [[H5927]] by way of the caravan [[H7931]] route [[H1870]] east [[H6924]] of Nobah [[H5025]] and Jogbehah, [[H3011]] and he attacked [[H5221]] their army, [[H4264]] [taking them] [[H4264]] by surprise. [[H983]] 
12 When Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] fled, [[H5127]] [Gideon] pursued [[H7291]] and captured [[H3920]] these two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of Midian, [[H4080]] routing [[H2729]] their entire [[H3605]] army. [[H4264]] 
13 After this, Gideon [[H1439]] son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] returned [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] the battle [[H4421]] along the Ascent of [[H4608]] Heres. [[H2775]] 
14 There he captured [[H3920]] a young man [[H5288]] of Succoth [[H5523]] and interrogated him. [[H7592]] The young man wrote down [[H3789]] for him [[H413]] the names of the seventy-seven [[H7657]] leaders [[H8269]] and elders [[H2205]] of Succoth. [[H5523]] 
15 And [Gideon] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Succoth [[H5523]] and said, [[H559]] “Here [[H2009]] are Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] about whom [[H834]] you taunted [[H2778]] me, [[H853]] saying, [[H559]] ‘[Are] the hands [[H3709]] of Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] already [[H6258]] in your possession, [[H3027]] that [[H3588]] we should give [[H5414]] bread [[H3899]] to your weary [[H3286]] men? [[H376]] 
16 Then he took [[H3947]] the elders [[H2205]] of the city, [[H5892]] and [using] [[H853]] the thorns [[H6975]] and briers [[H1303]] of the wilderness, [[H4057]] he disciplined [[H3045]] the men [[H376]] of Succoth. [[H5523]] 
17 He also pulled down [[H5422]] the tower [[H4026]] of Penuel [[H6439]] and killed [[H2026]] the men [[H376]] of the city. [[H5892]] 
18 Next, [Gideon] asked [[H559]] Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] “What kind [[H375]] of men [[H376]] did you kill [[H2026]] at Tabor?” [[H8396]] “Men like you,” [[H3644]] they answered, [[H559]] “[each] one [[H259]] resembling [[H8389]] the son [[H1121]] of a king.” [[H4428]] 
19 “They [[H1992]] were my brothers,” [[H251]] Gideon replied, [[H559]] “the sons [[H1121]] of my mother! [[H517]] As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] if [[H3863]] you had let them live, [[H2421]] I would not [[H3808]] kill [[H2026]] you.” [[H853]] 
20 So he said [[H559]] to Jether, [[H3500]] his firstborn, [[H1060]] “Get up [[H6965]] and kill them.” [[H2026]] But the young man [[H5288]] did not [[H3808]] draw [[H8025]] his sword; [[H2719]] he was fearful [[H3372]] because [[H3588]] he was still [[H5750]] a youth. [[H5288]] 
21 Then Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] said, [[H559]] “Get up [[H6965]] and kill [[H6293]] us yourself, [[H859]] for [[H3588]] as the man is, [[H376]] so is his strength.” [[H1369]] So Gideon [[H1439]] arose [[H6965]] and killed [[H2026]] Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] and he took [[H3947]] the crescent ornaments [[H7720]] from the necks [[H6677]] of their camels. [[H1581]] 
22 Then the Israelites [[H376]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Gideon, [[H1439]] “Rule over us— [[H4910]] you, [[H859]] and [[H1571]] your son [[H1121]] and [[H1571]] grandson— [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] you have delivered us [[H3467]] from the hand [[H3027]] of Midian.” [[H4080]] 
23 But Gideon [[H1439]] replied, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] will not [[H3808]] rule over you, [[H4910]] nor [[H3808]] will [[H4910]] my son. [[H1121]] The LORD [[H3068]] shall rule [[H4910]] over you.”  
24 Then he [[H1439]] added, [[H559]] “Let me make a request [[H7592]] of you, [[H4480]] that each of you [[H376]] give [[H5414]] me an earring [[H5141]] from his plunder.” [[H7998]] (Now [[H3588]] [the enemy] had gold [[H2091]] earrings [[H5141]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] were Ishmaelites.) [[H3459]] 
25 “We will give [them] [[H5414]] gladly,” [[H5414]] they replied. [[H559]] So they spread out [[H6566]] a garment, [[H8071]] and each man [[H376]] threw [[H7993]] an earring [[H5141]] from his plunder [[H7998]] onto it. [[H8033]] 
26 The weight [[H4948]] of the gold [[H2091]] earrings [[H5141]] he had requested [[H7592]] was [[H1961]] 1,700 [[H505]] [shekels], [[H2091]] in addition to [[H905]] the crescent ornaments, [[H7720]] the pendants, [[H5188]] the purple [[H713]] garments [[H899]] of [[H5921]] the kings [[H4428]] of Midian, [[H4080]] and the chains [[H6060]] from the necks [[H6677]] of their camels. [[H1581]] 
27 [From all this] Gideon [[H1439]] made [[H6213]] an ephod, [[H646]] which he placed [[H3322]] in Ophrah, [[H6084]] his hometown. [[H5892]] But soon all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] prostituted themselves [[H2181]] by worshiping it [[H310]] there, [[H8033]] and it became [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] to Gideon [[H1439]] and his household. [[H1004]] 
28 In this way Midian [[H4080]] was subdued [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and did not [[H3808]] raise [[H5375]] its head [[H7218]] again. [[H3254]] So the land [[H776]] had rest [[H8252]] for forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] in the days [[H3117]] of Gideon, [[H1439]] 
29 and he—Jerubbaal [[H3378]] son [[H1121]] of Joash— [[H3101]] returned [[H1980]] home [[H1004]] and settled down. [[H3427]] 
30 Gideon [[H1439]] had [[H1961]] seventy [[H7657]] sons [[H1121]] of his own, [[H3318]] since [[H3588]] he had [[H1961]] many [[H7227]] wives. [[H802]] 
31 His concubine, [[H6370]] who [dwelt] [[H834]] in Shechem, [[H7927]] also [[H1571]] bore [[H3205]] him a son, [[H1121]] and he named [[H7760]] him Abimelech. [[H40]] 
32 Later, Gideon [[H1439]] son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] died [[H4191]] at a ripe [[H2896]] old age [[H7872]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the tomb [[H6913]] of his father [[H1]] Joash [[H3101]] in Ophrah [[H6084]] of the Abiezrites. [[H33]] 
33 And [[H1961]] as soon as [[H834]] Gideon [[H1439]] was dead, [[H4191]] the Israelites [[H1121]] turned [[H7725]] and prostituted themselves [[H2181]] with [[H310]] the Baals, [[H1168]] and they set up [[H7760]] Baal-berith [[H1170]] as their god. [[H430]] 
34 The Israelites [[H1121]] failed [[H3808]] to remember [[H2142]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] who had delivered [[H5337]] them [[H853]] from the hands [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] their enemies [[H341]] on every side. [[H5439]] 
35 They did not [[H3808]] show [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of Jerubbaal [[H3378]] (that is, Gideon) [[H1439]] for all [[H3605]] the good things [[H2896]] he had done [[H6213]] for [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]
