# Judges 19
[[Judges 18|←]] • [[Judges 20|→]]
1 In those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] when there was no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Israel, [[H3478]] a Levite [[H3881]] who lived [[H1481]] in the remote [[H3411]] hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] took [[H3947]] for himself  a concubine [[H6370]] from  Bethlehem [[H1035]] in Judah. [[H3063]] 
2 But she [[H6370]] was unfaithful [[H2181]] to him [[H5921]] and left [[H1980]] him [[H853]] to return to [[H413]] her father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] in [[H413]] Bethlehem [[H1035]] in Judah. [[H3063]] After she had been [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] four [[H702]] months, [[H2320]] 
3 her husband [[H376]] got up [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] after her [[H310]] to speak [[H1696]] kindly [[H3820]] to her [[H5921]] and bring her back, [[H7725]] taking with him his servant [[H5288]] and a pair [[H6776]] of donkeys. [[H2543]] So [the girl] brought him [[H935]] into her father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] and when [her] [[H5291]] father [[H1]] saw him, [[H7200]] he gladly [[H8055]] welcomed him. [[H7125]] 
4 His father-in-law, [[H2859]] the girl’s [[H5291]] father, [[H1]] persuaded him to stay, [[H2388]] so he remained [[H3427]] with him [[H854]] three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] eating, [[H398]] drinking, [[H8354]] and lodging [[H3885]] there. [[H8033]] 
5 On the fourth [[H7243]] day, [[H3117]] they got up early [[H7925]] in the morning [[H1242]] and prepared [[H6965]] to go, [[H1980]] but the girl’s [[H5291]] father [[H1]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his son-in-law, [[H2860]] “Refresh [[H5582]] your heart [[H3820]] with a morsel [[H6595]] of bread, [[H3899]] and then [[H310]] you can go.” [[H1980]] 
6 So they sat down [[H3427]] and the two [[H8147]] of them ate [[H398]] and drank [[H8354]] together. [[H3162]] Then the girl’s [[H5291]] father [[H1]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the man, [[H376]] “Please [[H4994]] agree [[H2974]] to stay overnight [[H3885]] and let your heart [[H3820]] be merry.” [[H3190]] 
7 The man [[H376]] got up [[H6965]] to go, [[H1980]] but his father-in-law [[H2859]] persuaded him, [[H6484]] so he stayed [[H3885]] there that night. [[H8033]] 
8 On the fifth [[H2549]] day, [[H3117]] he got up early [[H7925]] in the morning [[H1242]] to leave, [[H1980]] but the girl’s [[H5291]] father [[H1]] said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] refresh [[H5582]] your heart.” [[H3824]] So they waited [[H4102]] until [[H5704]] late afternoon [[H5186]] and the two [[H8147]] of them ate. [[H398]] 
9 When the man [[H376]] got up [[H6965]] to depart [[H1980]] with his concubine [[H6370]] and his servant, [[H5288]] his father-in-law, [[H2859]] the girl’s [[H5291]] father, [[H1]] said [[H559]] to him,  “Look, [[H2009]] the day [[H3117]] is drawing [[H7503]] late. [[H6150]] Please [[H4994]] spend the night. [[H3885]] See, [[H2009]] the day [[H3117]] is almost over. [[H2583]] Spend the night [[H3885]] here, [[H6311]] that your heart [[H3824]] may be merry. [[H3190]] Then you can get up early [[H7925]] tomorrow [[H4279]] for your journey [[H1870]] and go [[H1980]] home. [[H168]] 
10 But the man [[H376]] was unwilling [[H3808]] to spend the night. [[H3885]] He got up [[H6965]] and departed, [[H1980]] and arrived [[H935]] opposite [[H5227]] Jebus [[H2982]] (that is, [[H1931]] Jerusalem), [[H3389]] with [[H5973]] his two [[H6776]] saddled [[H2280]] donkeys [[H2543]] and his concubine. [[H6370]] 
11 When they [[H1992]] were near [[H5973]] Jebus [[H2982]] and the day [[H3117]] was almost [[H3966]] gone, [[H7286]] the servant [[H5288]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his master, [[H113]] “Please, [[H4994]] let us stop [[H5493]] at [[H413]] this [[H2063]] Jebusite [[H2983]] city [[H5892]] and spend the night [[H3885]] here.”  
12 But his master [[H113]] replied, [[H559]] “We will not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] to [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of foreigners, [[H5237]] where [[H834]] there are no [[H3808]] Israelites. [[H1121]] We will go on [[H5674]] to [[H5704]] Gibeah.” [[H1390]] 
13 He continued, [[H559]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us try to reach [[H7126]] one [[H259]] of these towns [[H4725]] to spend the night [[H3885]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] or [[H176]] Ramah.” [[H7414]] 
14 So they continued [[H1980]] on their journey, [[H5674]] and the sun [[H8121]] set [[H935]] as they neared [[H681]] Gibeah [[H1390]] in Benjamin. [[H1144]] 
15 They stopped [[H5493]] to go in [[H935]] and lodge [[H3885]] in Gibeah. [[H1390]] The Levite went in [[H935]] and sat down [[H3427]] in the city [[H5892]] square, [[H7339]] but no [[H369]] one [[H376]] would take [[H622]] them [[H853]] into his home [[H1004]] for the night. [[H3885]] 
16 That evening [[H6153]] an old [[H2205]] man [[H376]] from the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] who was residing [[H1481]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] (the men [[H376]] of that place [[H4725]] were Benjamites) [[H1145]] came in [[H935]] from [[H4480]] his work [[H4639]] in [[H4480]] the field. [[H7704]] 
17 When he looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] the traveler [[H732]] in the city [[H5892]] square, [[H7339]] the old [[H2205]] man [[H376]] asked, [[H559]] “Where [[H575]] are you going, [[H1980]] and where [[H370]] have you come from?” [[H935]] 
18 [The Levite] replied, [[H559]] “We are [[H587]] traveling [[H5674]] from Bethlehem [[H1035]] in Judah [[H3063]] to [[H5704]] the remote [[H3411]] hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] where [[H8033]] I am from. [[H595]] I went [[H1980]] to [[H5704]] Bethlehem [[H1035]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and now I am [[H589]] going [[H1980]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] but no [[H369]] one [[H376]] has taken [[H622]] me into his home, [[H1004]] 
19 even though there is [[H3426]] both [[H1571]] straw [[H8401]] and [[H1571]] feed [[H4554]] for our donkeys, [[H2543]] and [[H1571]] bread [[H3899]] and wine [[H3196]] for me  and the maidservant [[H519]] and young man [[H5288]] with me. [[H5973]] There is nothing that [[H369]] we, your servants, [[H5650]] lack.” [[H4270]] 
20 “Peace to you,” [[H7965]] said [[H559]] the old [[H2205]] man. [[H376]] “Let me supply [[H5921]] everything [[H3605]] you need. [[H4270]] Only [[H7535]] do not [[H408]] spend the night [[H3885]] in the square.” [[H7339]] 
21 So he brought [[H935]] him to his house [[H1004]] and fed [[H1101]] his donkeys. [[H2543]] And they washed [[H7364]] their feet [[H7272]] and ate [[H398]] and drank. [[H8354]] 
22 While they [[H1992]] were enjoying [[H3190]] themselves, [[H3820]] suddenly [[H2009]] the wicked [[H1100]] men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] surrounded [[H5437]] the house. [[H1004]] Pounding [[H1849]] on [[H5921]] the door, [[H1817]] they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the old [[H2205]] man [[H376]] who owned [[H1167]] the house, [[H1004]] “Bring out [[H3318]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] your house [[H1004]] so we can have relations with him! [[H3045]] 
23 The owner [[H1167]] of the house [[H1004]] went out [[H3318]] and said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “No, [[H408]] my brothers, [[H251]] do not [[H408]] do this wicked thing! [[H7489]] After all, [[H310]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] is a guest [[H935]] in [[H413]] my house. [[H1004]] Do not [[H408]] commit [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] outrage. [[H5039]] 
24 Look, [[H2009]] let me bring out [[H3318]] my virgin [[H1330]] daughter [[H1323]] and the man’s concubine, [[H6370]] and you can use [[H6031]] them [[H853]] and do [[H6213]] with them  as you wish. [[H2896]] But do not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] such [[H2063]] a vile [[H5039]] thing [[H1697]] to this [[H2088]] man.” [[H376]] 
25 But the men [[H376]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] listen to him. [[H8085]] So [the man]  took [[H2388]] his concubine [[H6370]] and sent her [[H3318]] outside [[H2351]] to them, [[H413]] and they raped [[H3045]] her [[H853]] and abused [[H5953]] her  throughout [[H3605]] the night, [[H3915]] and at dawn [[H5927]] they let her go. [[H7971]] 
26 Early that morning, [[H6437]] the woman [[H802]] went back [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] where [[H834]] her master was staying, [[H113]] collapsed [[H5307]] at the doorway, [[H6607]] and lay there until [[H5704]] it was light. [[H216]] 
27 In the morning, [[H1242]] when her master [[H113]] got up [[H6965]] and opened [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] of the house [[H1004]] to go out [[H3318]] on his journey, [[H1870]] there was [[H2009]] his concubine, [[H6370]] collapsed [[H5307]] in the doorway [[H6607]] of the house, [[H1004]] with her hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the threshold. [[H5592]] 
28 “Get up,” [[H6965]] he told her. [[H559]] “Let us go.” [[H1980]] But there was no [[H369]] response. [[H6030]] So the man [[H376]] put [[H3947]] her on [[H5921]] his donkey [[H2543]] and set out [[H6965]] for home. [[H4725]] 
29 When he reached [[H935]] his house, [[H1004]] he picked up [[H3947]] a knife, [[H3979]] took hold [[H2388]] of his concubine, [[H6370]] cut her [[H5408]] limb by limb [[H6106]] into twelve [[H8147]] pieces, [[H5409]] and sent [[H7971]] her throughout [[H3605]] the territory [[H1366]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
30 And everyone [[H3605]] who saw [[H7200]] it said, [[H559]] “Nothing [[H3808]] like this [[H2063]] has been seen [[H7200]] or done [[H1961]] from the day [[H3117]] the Israelites [[H1121]] came out [[H5927]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] Think it over, [[H7760]] take counsel, [[H5779]] and speak up!” [[H1696]]
