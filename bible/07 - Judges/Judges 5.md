# Judges 5
[[Judges 4|←]] • [[Judges 6|→]]
1 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Deborah [[H1683]] and Barak [[H1301]] son [[H1121]] of Abinoam [[H42]] sang this song: [[H7891]] 
2 “When the princes [[H6546]] lead [[H6544]] in Israel, [[H3478]] when the people [[H5971]] volunteer, [[H5068]] bless [[H1288]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 Listen, [[H8085]] O kings! [[H4428]] Give ear, [[H238]] O princes! [[H7336]] I [[H595]] will sing [[H7891]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] I will sing praise [[H2167]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
4 O LORD, [[H3068]] when You went out [[H3318]] from Seir, [[H8165]] when You marched [[H6805]] from the land [[H7704]] of Edom, [[H123]] the earth [[H776]] trembled, [[H7493]] the heavens [[H8064]] poured [out rain], [[H5197]] and [[H1571]] the clouds [[H5645]] poured down [[H5197]] water. [[H4325]] 
5 The mountains [[H2022]] quaked [[H5140]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the One [[H2088]] of Sinai, [[H5514]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
6 In the days [[H3117]] of Shamgar [[H8044]] son [[H1121]] of Anath, [[H6067]] in the days [[H3117]] of Jael, [[H3278]] the highways [[H734]] were deserted [[H2308]] and the travelers [[H1980]] took [[H1980]] the byways. [[H6128]] 
7 Life in the villages [[H6520]] ceased, [[H2308]] it ended [[H2308]] in Israel, [[H3478]] until [[H5704]] I, Deborah, [[H1683]] arose, [[H6965]] a mother [[H517]] in Israel. [[H3478]] 
8 When they chose [[H977]] new [[H2319]] gods, [[H430]] then [[H227]] war [[H3901]] came to their gates. [[H8179]] Not [[H518]] a shield [[H4043]] or spear [[H7420]] was found [[H7200]] among forty [[H705]] thousand [[H505]] in Israel. [[H3478]] 
9 My heart [[H3820]] is with the princes [[H2710]] of Israel, [[H3478]] with the volunteers [[H5068]] among the people. [[H5971]] Bless [[H1288]] the LORD! [[H3068]] 
10 You who ride [[H7392]] white [[H6715]] donkeys, [[H860]] who sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] saddle blankets, [[H4055]] and you who travel [[H1980]] the road, [[H1870]] ponder [[H7878]] 
11 the voices [[H6963]] of the singers [[H2686]] at [[H996]] the watering places. [[H4857]] There [[H8033]] they shall recount [[H8567]] the righteous acts [[H6666]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the righteous deeds [[H6666]] of His warriors [[H6520]] in Israel. [[H3478]] Then [[H227]] the people [[H5971]] of the LORD [[H3068]] went down [[H3381]] to the gates: [[H8179]] 
12 ‘Awake, [[H5782]] awake, [[H5782]] O Deborah! [[H1683]] Awake, [[H5782]] awake, [[H5782]] sing [[H1696]] a song! [[H7892]] Arise, [[H6965]] O Barak, [[H1301]] and take hold of [[H7617]] your captives, [[H7628]] O son [[H1121]] of Abinoam!’ [[H42]] 
13 Then [[H227]] the survivors [[H8300]] came down [[H7287]] to the nobles; [[H117]] the people [[H5971]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came down [[H7287]] to me  as warriors. [[H1368]] 
14 Some came from [[H4480]] Ephraim, [[H669]] with their roots [[H8328]] in Amalek; [[H6002]] Benjamin [[H1144]] came with your people [[H5971]] after you. [[H310]] The commanders [[H2710]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] Machir, [[H4353]] the bearers [[H4900]] of the marshal’s [[H5608]] staff [[H7626]] from Zebulun. [[H2074]] 
15 The princes [[H8269]] of Issachar [[H3485]] were with [[H5973]] Deborah, [[H1683]] and Issachar [[H3485]] was with Barak, [[H1301]] rushing [[H7971]] into the valley [[H6010]] at his heels. [[H7272]] In the clans [[H6391]] of Reuben [[H7205]] was great [[H1419]] indecision. [[H2711]] 
16 Why [[H4100]] did you sit [[H3427]] among [[H996]] the sheepfolds [[H4942]] to hear [[H8085]] the whistling [[H8292]] for the flocks? [[H5739]] In the clans [[H6391]] of Reuben [[H7205]] was great [[H1419]] indecision. [[H2714]] 
17 Gilead [[H1568]] remained [[H7931]] beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan. [[H3383]] Dan, [[H1835]] why [[H4100]] did you linger [[H1481]] by the ships? [[H591]] Asher [[H836]] stayed [[H3427]] at the coast [[H2348]] and remained [[H7931]] in [[H5921]] his harbors. [[H4664]] 
18 Zebulun [[H2074]] was a people [[H5971]] who risked [[H2778]] their lives; [[H5315]] Naphtali, too, [[H5321]] on [[H5921]] the heights [[H4791]] of the battlefield. [[H7704]] 
19 Kings [[H4428]] came [[H935]] and fought; [[H3898]] then [[H227]] the kings [[H4428]] of Canaan [[H3667]] fought [[H3898]] at Taanach [[H8590]] by [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Megiddo, [[H4023]] but they took [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] plunder [[H1215]] of silver. [[H3701]] 
20 From [[H4480]] the heavens [[H8064]] the stars [[H3556]] fought; [[H3898]] from their courses [[H4546]] they fought [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Sisera. [[H5516]] 
21 The River [[H5158]] Kishon [[H7028]] swept them away, [[H1640]] the ancient [[H6917]] river, [[H5158]] the River [[H5158]] Kishon. [[H7028]] March on, [[H1869]] O my soul, [[H5315]] in strength! [[H5797]] 
22 Then [[H227]] the hooves [[H6119]] of horses [[H5483]] thundered— [[H1986]] the mad galloping [[H1726]] of his stallions. [[H47]] 
23 ‘Curse [[H779]] Meroz,’ [[H4789]] says [[H559]] the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] ‘Bitterly curse [[H779]] her inhabitants; [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] they did not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] to help [[H5833]] the LORD, [[H3068]] to help [[H5833]] the LORD [[H3068]] against the mighty.’ [[H1368]] 
24 Most blessed [[H1288]] among women [[H802]] [is] Jael, [[H3278]] the wife [[H802]] of Heber [[H2268]] the Kenite, [[H7017]] most blessed [[H1288]] of tent-dwelling [[H168]] women. [[H802]] 
25 He asked for [[H7592]] water, [[H4325]] [and] she gave [[H5414]] him milk. [[H2461]] In a magnificent [[H117]] bowl [[H5602]] she brought him [[H7126]] curdled milk. [[H2529]] 
26 She reached [[H7971]] for the tent peg, [[H3489]] her right [[H3225]] hand [[H3027]] for the workman's [[H6001]] hammer. [[H1989]] She struck [[H1986]] Sisera [[H5516]] and crushed [[H4277]] his skull; [[H7218]] she shattered [[H4272]] and pierced [[H2498]] his temple. [[H7541]] 
27 At [[H996]] her feet [[H7272]] he collapsed, [[H3766]] he fell, [[H5307]] there he lay still; [[H7901]] at [[H996]] her feet [[H7272]] he collapsed, [[H3766]] he fell; [[H5307]] where [[H834]] he collapsed, [[H3766]] there [[H8033]] he fell [[H5307]] dead. [[H7703]] 
28 Sisera’s [[H5516]] mother [[H517]] looked [[H8259]] through [[H1157]] the window; [[H2474]] she peered through [[H1157]] the lattice [[H822]] and lamented: [[H2980]] ‘Why [[H4069]] is his chariot [[H7393]] so long [[H954]] in coming? [[H935]] What [[H4069]] has delayed [[H309]] the clatter [[H6471]] of his chariots?’ [[H4818]] 
29 Her wisest [[H2450]] ladies [[H8282]] answer; [[H6030]] indeed [[H637]] she [[H1931]] keeps [[H7725]] telling [[H559]] herself,  
30 ‘Are they not [[H3808]] finding [[H4672]] and dividing [[H2505]] the spoil— [[H7998]] a girl [[H7356]] [or] two [[H7361]] for each [[H7218]] warrior, [[H1397]] a plunder [[H7998]] of dyed garments [[H6648]] for Sisera, [[H5516]] the spoil [[H7998]] of embroidered [[H7553]] garments [[H6648]] for the neck [[H6677]] of the looter?’ [[H7998]] 
31 So [[H3651]] may all [[H3605]] your enemies [[H341]] perish, [[H6]] O LORD, [[H3068]] But may those who love You [[H157]] shine like [[H3318]] the sun [[H8121]] at its brightest. [[H1369]] And the land [[H776]] had rest [[H8252]] for forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]
