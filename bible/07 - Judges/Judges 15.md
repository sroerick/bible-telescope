1 Later on, [[H1961]] at the time [[H3117]] of the wheat [[H2406]] harvest, [[H7105]] Samson [[H8123]] took [[H1423]] a young goat [[H5795]] and went to visit [[H6485]] his wife. [[H802]] “I want to go [[H935]] to [[H413]] my wife [[H802]] in her room,” [[H2315]] he said. [[H559]] But her father [[H1]] would not [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] him enter. [[H935]] 
2 “I was sure [[H559]] you thoroughly hated her,” [[H8130]] said [[H559]] her father, [[H1]] “so I gave [[H5414]] her to one of the men who accompanied you. [[H4828]] Is not [[H3808]] her younger [[H6996]] sister [[H269]] more beautiful [[H2896]] than she? [[H4480]] Please [[H4994]] take [[H1961]] her instead.” [[H8478]] 
3 Samson [[H8123]] said [[H559]] to them,  “This time [[H6471]] I will be blameless [[H5352]] in doing [[H6213]] harm [[H7451]] to the Philistines.” [[H6430]] 
4 Then Samson [[H8123]] went out [[H1980]] and caught [[H3920]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] foxes. [[H7776]] And he took [[H3947]] torches, [[H3940]] turned [[H6437]] the foxes tail-to-tail, [[H2180]] and fastened [[H7760]] a [[H259]] torch [[H3940]] between [[H996]] each pair [[H8147]] of tails. [[H2180]] 
5 Then he lit [[H1197]] the torches [[H3940]] and released [the foxes] [[H7971]] into the standing grain [[H7054]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] burning up [[H1197]] the piles of grain [[H1430]] and the standing grain, [[H7054]] as well as [[H5704]] the vineyards [[H3754]] and olive groves. [[H2132]] 
6 “Who [[H4310]] did [[H6213]] this?” [[H2063]] the Philistines [[H6430]] demanded. [[H559]] “It was Samson, [[H8123]] the son-in-law [[H2860]] of the Timnite,” [[H8554]] they were told. [[H559]] “For [[H3588]] his wife [[H802]] was given [[H5414]] to his companion.” [[H4828]] So the Philistines [[H6430]] went up [[H5927]] and burned [[H8313]] her and her father [[H1]] to death. [[H784]] 
7 And Samson [[H8123]] told them, [[H559]] “Because [[H518]] you have done [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] I will not rest [[H2308]] until [[H3588]] I have taken vengeance [[H5358]] upon you.”  
8 And he struck [[H5221]] them ruthlessly [[H7785]] with a great [[H1419]] slaughter, [[H4347]] and then went down [[H3381]] and stayed [[H3427]] in the cave [[H5585]] at the rock [[H5553]] of Etam. [[H5862]] 
9 Then the Philistines [[H6430]] went up, [[H5927]] camped [[H2583]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and deployed themselves [[H5203]] against Lehi. [[H3896]] 
10 “Why [[H4100]] have you attacked [[H5927]] us?” [[H5921]] said [[H559]] the men [[H376]] of Judah. [[H3063]] The Philistines replied, [[H559]] “We have come [[H5927]] to arrest [[H631]] Samson [[H8123]] and pay him back [[H6213]] for what [[H834]] he has done [[H6213]] to us.”  
11 In response, three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] went [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the cave [[H5585]] at the rock [[H5553]] of Etam, [[H5862]] and they asked [[H559]] Samson, [[H8123]] “Do you not [[H3808]] realize [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Philistines [[H6430]] rule [[H4910]] over us?  What [[H4100]] have you done [[H6213]] to us?”  “I have done [[H6213]] to them what [[H834]] they did to me,” [[H6213]] he replied. [[H559]] 
12 But they said [[H559]] to him,  “We have come down [[H3381]] to arrest you [[H631]] and hand you over to [[H5414]] the Philistines.” [[H6430]] Samson [[H8123]] replied, [[H559]] “Swear [[H7650]] to me  that [[H6435]] you will not kill [[H6293]] me {yourselves}.”  
13 “No,” [[H3808]] they answered, [[H559]] “we will not [[H3808]] kill you, [[H4191]] but [[H3588]] we will tie you up securely [[H631]] and hand you over to [[H5414]] them.” [[H3027]] So they bound him [[H631]] with two [[H8147]] new [[H2319]] ropes [[H5688]] and led him up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the rock. [[H5553]] 
14 When [[H1931]] [Samson] arrived [[H935]] in [[H5704]] Lehi, [[H3896]] the Philistines [[H6430]] came out shouting [[H7321]] against him. [[H7125]] And the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came mightily [[H6743]] upon him. [[H5921]] The ropes [[H5688]] on [[H5921]] his arms [[H2220]] became [[H1961]] like burnt [[H1197]] flax, [[H6593]] and the bonds [[H612]] broke loose [[H4549]] from [[H5921]] his hands. [[H3027]] 
15 He found [[H4672]] the fresh [[H2961]] jawbone [[H3895]] of a donkey, [[H2543]] reached out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] and took it, [[H3947]] and struck down [[H5221]] a thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]] 
16 Then Samson [[H8123]] said: [[H559]] “With the jawbone [[H3895]] of a donkey [[H2543]] I have piled them [[H2563]] into heaps. [[H2563]] With the jawbone [[H3895]] of a donkey [[H2543]] I have slain [[H5221]] a thousand [[H505]] men.” [[H376]] 
17 And [[H1961]] when [Samson] had finished [[H3615]] speaking, [[H1696]] he cast [[H7993]] the jawbone [[H3895]] from his hand; [[H3027]] and he named [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Ramath-lehi. [[H7437]] 
18 And being very [[H3966]] thirsty, [[H6770]] [Samson] cried out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “You [[H859]] have accomplished [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] deliverance [[H8668]] through [[H3027]] Your servant. [[H5650]] Must I now [[H6258]] die [[H4191]] of thirst [[H6772]] and fall [[H5307]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the uncircumcised?” [[H6189]] 
19 So God [[H430]] opened up [[H1234]] the hollow place [[H4388]] in Lehi, [[H3896]] and water [[H4325]] came out [[H3318]] of it. [[H4480]] When Samson drank, [[H8354]] his strength [[H7307]] returned, [[H7725]] and he was revived. [[H2421]] That is why [[H5921]] he named it [[H7121]] En-hakkore, [[H5875]] and it remains [[H834]] in Lehi [[H3895]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
20 And [Samson] judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] for twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] in the days [[H3117]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]
