[[Judges 15|←]] • [[Judges 17|→]]
1 One day Samson [[H8123]] went [[H1980]] to Gaza, [[H5804]] where [[H8033]] he saw [[H7200]] a prostitute [[H2181]] and went in to spend the night [[H935]] with her. [[H413]] 
2 When the Gazites [[H5841]] heard that Samson [[H8123]] was there, [[H2008]] they surrounded [that place] [[H5437]] and lay in wait [[H693]] for him  all [[H3605]] night [[H3915]] at the city [[H5892]] gate. [[H8179]] They were quiet [[H2790]] throughout [[H3605]] the night, [[H3915]] saying, [[H559]] “Let us wait until [[H5704]] dawn; [[H216]] then we will kill him.” [[H2026]] 
3 But Samson [[H8123]] lay there [[H7901]] only until [[H5704]] midnight. [[H2677]] Then he got up [[H6965]] and took hold [[H270]] of the doors [[H1817]] of the city [[H5892]] gate, [[H8179]] along with the two [[H8147]] gateposts, [[H4201]] and pulled them out, [[H5265]] bar [[H1280]] and all. [[H5973]] Then he put [them] [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] his shoulders [[H3802]] and took [[H5927]] them to [[H413]] the top [[H7218]] of the mountain [[H2022]] overlooking [[H5921]] Hebron. [[H2275]] 
4 Some time later, [[H310]] [Samson] fell in love with [[H157]] a woman [[H802]] in the Valley [[H5158]] of Sorek, [[H7796]] whose name [[H8034]] was Delilah. [[H1807]] 
5 The lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] went [[H5927]] to her [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “Entice [[H6601]] him [[H853]] and find out [[H7200]] the source of [[H4100]] his great [[H1419]] strength [[H3581]] and how [[H4100]] we can overpower [[H3201]] him  to tie him up [[H631]] and subdue him. [[H6031]] Then each one [[H376]] of us [[H587]] will give [[H5414]] you  eleven hundred [shekels] [[H505]] of silver. [[H3701]] 
6 So Delilah [[H1807]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samson, [[H8123]] “Please [[H4994]] tell me [[H5046]] the source [[H4100]] of your great [[H1419]] strength [[H3581]] and how [[H4100]] you could be tied up [[H631]] and subdued.” [[H6031]] 
7 Samson [[H8123]] told her, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] they tie me up [[H631]] with seven [[H7651]] fresh [[H3892]] bowstrings [[H3499]] that [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] been dried, [[H2717]] I will become as weak [[H2470]] as any [[H259]] other man.” [[H120]] 
8 So the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] brought [[H5927]] her  seven [[H7651]] fresh [[H3892]] bowstrings [[H3499]] that [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] been dried, [[H2717]] and she bound him [[H631]] with them.  
9 While the men [[H693]] were hidden [[H3427]] in her  room, [[H2315]] she called out, [[H559]] “Samson, [[H8123]] the Philistines [are] [[H6430]] here!” [[H5921]] But he snapped [[H5423]] the bowstrings [[H3499]] like [[H834]] a strand [[H6616]] of yarn [[H5296]] breaks [[H5423]] when it touches [[H7306]] the flame. [[H784]] So the source of his strength [[H3581]] remained unknown. [[H3808]] 
10 Then Delilah [[H1807]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samson, [[H8123]] “You have mocked [[H2048]] me  and lied to me! [[H1696]] Will you now [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] tell [[H5046]] me how [[H4100]] you can be bound?” [[H631]] 
11 He replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] they tie me up [[H631]] with new [[H2319]] ropes [[H5688]] that [[H834]] have never [[H3808]] been used, [[H6213]] I will become as weak [[H2470]] as any [[H259]] other man.” [[H120]] 
12 So Delilah [[H1807]] took [[H3947]] new [[H2319]] ropes, [[H5688]] tied him up, [[H631]] and called out, [[H559]] “Samson, [[H8123]] the Philistines are [[H6430]] here!” [[H5921]] But while the men [[H693]] were hidden [[H3427]] in her room, [[H2315]] he snapped [[H5423]] the ropes off [[H5921]] his arms [[H2220]] like a thread. [[H2339]] 
13 Then Delilah [[H1807]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samson, [[H8123]] “You have mocked [[H2048]] me  and lied to me [[H1696]] all along! [[H2008]] Tell [[H5046]] me how [[H4100]] you can be tied up.” [[H631]] He told her, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you weave [[H707]] the seven [[H7651]] braids [[H4253]] of my head [[H7218]] into [[H5973]] the web of a loom [and fasten it with a pin, I will become as weak as any other man.]” [[H4545]] 
14 [So while he slept, Delilah took the seven braids of his hair and wove them into the web]. Then she fastened [[H8628]] the braids with a pin [[H3489]] and called [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Samson, [[H8123]] the Philistines [are] [[H6430]] here!” [[H5921]] But he awoke [[H3364]] from his sleep [[H8142]] and pulled out [[H5265]] the pin [[H3489]] with the loom [[H708]] and the web. [[H4545]] 
15 “How [[H349]] can you say, [[H559]] ‘I love you,’” [[H157]] she told him, [[H559]] “when your heart [[H3820]] is not [[H369]] with me? [[H854]] This [[H2088]] is the third [[H7969]] time [[H6471]] you have mocked [[H2048]] me and failed [[H3808]] to reveal [[H5046]] to me  the source [[H4100]] of your great strength!” [[H3581]] 
16 Finally, after [[H1961]] she had pressed [[H6693]] him daily [[H3117]] with her words [[H1697]] and pleaded [[H509]] until he [[H5315]] was sick [[H7114]] to death, [[H4191]] 
17 he told [[H5046]] her  all that was [[H3605]] in his heart: [[H3820]] “My hair [[H7218]] has never [[H3808]] been cut, [[H4177]] because [[H3588]] I [have been] [[H589]] a Nazirite [[H5139]] to God [[H430]] from [[H4480]] my mother's [[H517]] womb. [[H990]] If [[H518]] I am shaved, [[H1548]] my strength [[H3581]] will leave me, [[H5493]] and I will become as weak [[H2470]] as [[H1961]] any [[H3605]] other man. [[H120]] 
18 When Delilah [[H1807]] realized [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he had revealed [[H5046]] to her  his whole [[H3605]] heart, [[H3820]] she sent [[H7971]] this message [[H559]] to the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] “Come up [[H5927]] once more, [[H6471]] for [[H3588]] he has revealed [[H5046]] to me  his whole [[H3605]] heart.” [[H3820]] Then the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H5927]] to her, [[H413]] bringing [[H5927]] the money [[H3701]] in their hands. [[H3027]] 
19 And having lulled him to sleep [[H3462]] on [[H5921]] her lap, [[H1290]] she called [[H7121]] a man [[H376]] to shave off [[H1548]] the seven [[H7651]] braids [[H4253]] of his head. [[H7218]] In this way [[H2490]] she began to subdue him, [[H6031]] and his strength [[H3581]] left him. [[H5493]] 
20 Then she called out, [[H559]] “Samson, [[H8123]] the Philistines [are] [[H6430]] here!” [[H5921]] When [Samson] awoke [[H3364]] from his sleep, [[H8142]] he thought, [[H559]] “I will escape [[H3318]] as I did before [[H6471]] and shake myself free.” [[H5287]] But he [[H1931]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had departed [[H5493]] from him. [[H5921]] 
21 Then the Philistines [[H6430]] seized him, [[H270]] gouged out [[H5365]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and brought him down [[H3381]] to Gaza, [[H5804]] where he was bound [[H631]] with bronze shackles [[H5178]] and forced [[H1961]] to grind [[H2912]] grain in the prison. [[H1004]] 
22 However, the hair [[H8181]] of his head [[H7218]] began [[H2490]] to grow [[H6779]] back after [[H834]] it had been shaved. [[H1548]] 
23 Now the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered together [[H622]] to offer [[H2076]] a great [[H1419]] sacrifice [[H2077]] to their god [[H430]] Dagon. [[H1712]] They rejoiced [[H8057]] and said, [[H559]] “Our god [[H430]] has delivered [[H5414]] Samson [[H8123]] our enemy [[H341]] into our hands.” [[H3027]] 
24 And when the people [[H5971]] saw him, [[H7200]] they praised [[H1984]] their god, [[H430]] saying: [[H3588]] “Our god [[H430]] has delivered [[H5414]] into our hands [[H3027]] our enemy [[H341]] who destroyed [[H2717]] our land [[H776]] and [[H834]] multiplied [[H7235]] our dead.” [[H2491]] 
25 And [[H1961]] while their hearts [[H3820]] were merry, [[H2896]] they said, [[H559]] “Call [[H7121]] for Samson [[H8123]] to entertain us.” [[H7832]] So they called [[H7121]] Samson [[H8123]] out of the prison [[H1004]] to entertain them. [[H6711]] And they stationed [[H5975]] him [[H853]] between [[H996]] the pillars. [[H5982]] 
26 Samson [[H8123]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the servant [[H5288]] who held [[H2388]] his hand, [[H3027]] “Lead [[H3240]] me [[H853]] where I can feel [[H3237]] the pillars [[H5982]] supporting [[H3559]] the temple, [[H1004]] so I can lean [[H8172]] against them.” [[H5921]] 
27 Now the temple [[H1004]] was full of [[H4390]] men [[H376]] and women; [[H802]] all [[H3605]] the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] were there, [[H8033]] and about three [[H7969]] thousand men [[H505]] and women [[H802]] were on [[H5921]] the roof [[H1406]] watching [[H7200]] Samson [[H8123]] entertain them. [[H7832]] 
28 Then Samson [[H8123]] called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD: [[H3068]] “O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] please [[H4994]] remember me. [[H2142]] Strengthen me, [[H2388]] O God, [[H430]] just [[H389]] once more, [[H6471]] so that with one [[H259]] vengeful blow [[H5359]] I may pay back [[H5358]] the Philistines [[H6430]] for my two [[H8147]] eyes.” [[H5869]] 
29 And Samson [[H8123]] reached out [[H3943]] for the two [[H8147]] central [[H8432]] pillars [[H5982]] supporting [[H3559]] the temple. [[H1004]] Bracing himself [[H5564]] against them [[H5921]] with his right hand [[H3225]] on one [[H259]] and his left hand [[H8040]] on the other, [[H259]] 
30 Samson [[H8123]] said, [[H559]] “Let me [[H5315]] die [[H4191]] with [[H5973]] the Philistines.” [[H6430]] Then he pushed [[H5186]] with all his might, [[H3581]] and the temple [[H1004]] fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] the lords [[H5633]] and [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people in it. [[H5971]] So in his death [[H4194]] he killed [[H4191]] more [[H7227]] than [[H834]] he had killed [[H4191]] in his life. [[H2416]] 
31 Then [Samson's] brothers [[H251]] and his father’s [[H1]] family [[H1004]] came down, [[H3381]] carried him back, [[H5927]] and buried [[H6912]] him between [[H996]] Zorah [[H6881]] and Eshtaol [[H847]] in the tomb [[H6913]] of his father [[H1]] Manoah. [[H4495]] And he [[H1931]] had judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] twenty [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]]
