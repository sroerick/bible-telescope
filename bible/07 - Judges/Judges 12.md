1 Then the men [[H376]] of Ephraim [[H669]] assembled [[H6817]] and crossed [the Jordan] [[H5674]] to Zaphon. [[H6828]] They said [[H559]] to Jephthah, [[H3316]] “Why [[H4069]] have you crossed over [[H5674]] to fight [[H3898]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] without [[H3808]] calling [[H7121]] us to go [[H1980]] with you? [[H5973]] We will burn your house [[H1004]] down [[H8313]] with you inside!” [[H784]] 
2 But Jephthah [[H3316]] replied, [[H559]] “My people [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] had [[H1961]] a serious [[H3966]] conflict [[H7379]] with the Ammonites, [[H1121]] and when I called, [[H2199]] you did not [[H3808]] deliver [[H3467]] me [[H853]] out of their hands. [[H3027]] 
3 When I saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] you would not [[H369]] deliver me, [[H3467]] I risked [[H7760]] my life [[H5315]] and crossed over [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the Ammonites, [[H1121]] and the LORD [[H3068]] delivered them [[H5414]] into my hand. [[H3027]] Why then [[H4100]] have you come [[H5927]] today [[H3117]] to fight [[H3898]] against me?”  
4 Then Jephthah [[H3316]] gathered [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] of the men [[H376]] of Gilead [[H1568]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H854]] Ephraim. [[H669]] And the men [[H376]] of Gilead [[H1568]] struck them down [[H5221]] because [[H3588]] the Ephraimites [[H669]] had said, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] Gileadites [[H1568]] are fugitives [[H6412]] in Ephraim, [[H669]] living in the territories [[H8432]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh. [[H4519]] 
5 The Gileadites [[H1568]] captured [[H3920]] the fords [[H4569]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] leading to Ephraim, [[H669]] and [[H1961]] whenever [[H3588]] a fugitive [[H6412]] from Ephraim [[H669]] would say, [[H559]] “Let me cross over,” [[H5674]] the Gileadites [[H1568]] would ask him, [[H559]] “Are you [[H859]] an Ephraimite?” [[H673]] If he answered, [[H559]] “No,” [[H3808]] 
6 they told him, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] say [[H559]] Shibboleth.” [[H7641]] If he said, [[H559]] “Sibboleth,” [[H5451]] because he could [[H3559]] not [[H3808]] pronounce [[H1696]] it correctly, [[H3651]] they seized [[H270]] him and killed [[H7819]] him at [[H413]] the fords [[H4569]] of the Jordan. [[H3383]] So at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] 42,000 [[H705]] Ephraimites [[H669]] were killed. [[H5307]] 
7 Jephthah [[H3316]] judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] six [[H8337]] years, [[H8141]] and when he [[H3316]] died, [[H4191]] he was buried [[H6912]] in one of the cities [[H5892]] of Gilead. [[H1568]] 
8 After Jephthah, [[H310]] Ibzan [[H78]] of  Bethlehem [[H1035]] judged [[H8199]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
9 He had [[H1961]] thirty [[H7970]] sons, [[H1121]] as well as thirty [[H7970]] daughters [[H1323]] whom he gave in marriage [[H7971]] to men outside his clan; [[H2351]] and for his sons [[H1121]] he brought back [[H935]] thirty [[H7970]] wives [[H1323]] from [[H4480]] elsewhere. [[H2351]] Ibzan judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] seven [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]] 
10 Then Ibzan [[H78]] died, [[H4191]] and he was buried [[H6912]] in Bethlehem. [[H1035]] 
11 After Ibzan, [[H310]] Elon [[H356]] the Zebulunite [[H2075]] judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] ten [[H6235]] years. [[H8141]] 
12 Then Elon [[H436]] the Zebulunite [[H2075]] died, [[H4191]] and he was buried [[H6912]] in Aijalon [[H357]] in the land [[H776]] of Zebulun. [[H2074]] 
13 After Elon, [[H310]] Abdon [[H5658]] son [[H1121]] of Hillel, [[H1985]] from Pirathon, [[H6553]] judged [[H8199]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
14 He had [[H1961]] forty [[H705]] sons [[H1121]] and thirty [[H7970]] grandsons, [[H1121]] who rode [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] seventy [[H7657]] donkeys. [[H5895]] And he judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] eight [[H8083]] years. [[H8141]] 
15 Then Abdon [[H5658]] son [[H1121]] of Hillel, [[H1985]] from Pirathon, [[H6553]] died, [[H4191]] and he was buried [[H6912]] at Pirathon [[H6552]] in [[H776]] Ephraim, [[H669]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of the Amalekites. [[H6003]]
