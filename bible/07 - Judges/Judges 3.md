[[Judges 2|←]] • [[Judges 4|→]]
1 These [[H428]] are the nations [[H1471]] the LORD [[H3068]] left [[H3240]] to test [[H5254]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] who [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] any [[H3605]] of the wars [[H4421]] in Canaan, [[H3667]] 
2 if only [[H7535]] to teach [[H3925]] warfare [[H4421]] to the subsequent generations [[H1755]] of Israel, [[H3478]] especially [[H7535]] to those who [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] known it [[H3045]] formerly: [[H6440]] 
3 the five [[H2568]] rulers [[H5633]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] all [[H3605]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] the Sidonians, [[H6722]] and the Hivites [[H2340]] who lived [[H3427]] in the mountains [[H2022]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] from Mount [[H2022]] Baal-hermon [[H1179]] to Lebo-hamath. [[H2574]] 
4 [These nations] were [left] [[H1961]] to test [[H5254]] the Israelites, [[H3478]] to find out [[H3045]] whether they would keep [[H8085]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] He had given [[H6680]] their fathers [[H1]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
5 Thus the Israelites [[H1121]] continued to live [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Amorites, [[H567]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites. [[H2983]] 
6 And they took [[H3947]] the daughters [of these people] [[H1323]] in marriage, [[H802]] gave [[H5414]] their own daughters [[H1323]] to their sons, [[H1121]] and served [[H5647]] their gods. [[H430]] 
7 So the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] they forgot [[H7911]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] and served [[H5647]] the Baals [[H1168]] and the Asherahs. [[H842]] 
8 Then the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] burned [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and He sold them [[H4376]] into the hands [[H3027]] of  Cushan-rishathaim [[H3573]] king [[H4428]] of Mesopotamia, [[H763]] and the Israelites [[H1121]] served [[H5647]] him [[H3573]] eight [[H8083]] years. [[H8141]] 
9 But when the Israelites [[H1121]] cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] [He] [[H3068]] raised up [[H6965]] Othniel [[H6274]] son [[H1121]] of Kenaz, [[H7073]] Caleb’s [[H3612]] youngest [[H6996]] brother, [[H251]] as a deliverer [[H3467]] to save [[H3467]] [them]. [[H1121]] 
10 The Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon him, [[H5921]] and he became Israel's [[H3478]] judge [[H8199]] and went out [[H3318]] to war. [[H4421]] And the LORD [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] Cushan-rishathaim [[H3573]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] into the hands [of Othniel], [[H3027]] who prevailed [[H5810]] against [[H5921]] him. [[H3573]] 
11 So the land [[H776]] had rest [[H8252]] for forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] until Othniel [[H6274]] son [[H1121]] of Kenaz [[H7073]] died. [[H4191]] 
12 Once again [[H3254]] the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] So He [[H3068]] gave Eglon [[H5700]] king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] power [[H2388]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H5921]] they had done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 After enlisting the Ammonites [[H1121]] and Amalekites [[H6002]] to join forces [[H622]] with him, [[H413]] [Eglon] attacked [[H1980]] and defeated [[H5221]] Israel, [[H3478]] taking possession of [[H3423]] the City [[H5892]] of Palms. [[H8558]] 
14 The Israelites [[H1121]] served [[H5647]] Eglon [[H5700]] king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] eighteen [[H8083]] years. [[H8141]] 
15 And again [they] [[H1121]] cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He [[H3068]] raised up [[H6965]] Ehud [[H164]] son [[H1121]] of Gera, [[H1617]] a left-handed [[H334]] Benjamite, [[H1121]] as their deliverer. [[H3467]] So [they] [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] him [[H3027]] with tribute [[H4503]] to Eglon [[H5700]] king [[H4428]] of Moab. [[H4124]] 
16 Now Ehud [[H164]] had made [[H6213]] for himself  a double-edged [[H8147]] sword [[H2719]] a cubit [[H1574]] long. [[H753]] He strapped [[H2296]] it to [[H5921]] his right [[H3225]] thigh [[H3409]] under [[H8478]] his cloak [[H4055]] 
17 and brought [[H7126]] the tribute [[H4503]] to Eglon [[H5700]] king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] who [[H5700]] was an obese [[H3966]] man. [[H376]] 
18 After [[H834]] Ehud had finished [[H3615]] presenting [[H7126]] the tribute, [[H4503]] he ushered out [[H7971]] those [[H5971]] who had carried [[H5375]] it. [[H4503]] 
19 But upon reaching [[H4480]] the idols [[H6456]] near [[H854]] Gilgal, [[H1537]] he himself [[H1931]] turned back [[H7725]] and said, [[H559]] “I have a secret [[H5643]] message [[H1697]] for you, [[H413]] O king.” [[H4428]] “Silence,” [[H2013]] said the king, [[H559]] and all [[H3605]] his attendants [[H5975]] left him. [[H3318]] 
20 Then Ehud [[H164]] approached [[H935]] him while he [[H1931]] was sitting [[H3427]] alone [[H905]] in the coolness of [[H4747]] his upper room. [[H5944]] “I have a word [[H1697]] from God [[H430]] for you,” [[H413]] Ehud [[H164]] said, [[H559]] and the king rose [[H6965]] from [[H5921]] [his] seat. [[H3678]] 
21 And Ehud [[H164]] reached [[H7971]] with his left [[H8040]] hand, [[H3027]] pulled [[H3947]] the sword [[H2719]] from [[H5921]] his right [[H3225]] thigh, [[H3409]] and plunged [[H8628]] it into Eglon’s belly. [[H990]] 
22 Even [[H1571]] the handle [[H5325]] sank in [[H935]] after [[H310]] the blade, [[H3851]] and Eglon’s fat [[H2459]] closed in [[H5462]] over [[H1157]] it, [[H3851]] so that [[H3588]] Ehud did not [[H3808]] withdraw [[H8025]] the sword [[H2719]] from his belly. [[H990]] And Eglon’s bowels [[H6574]] emptied. [[H3318]] 
23 Then Ehud [[H164]] went out [[H3318]] through the porch, [[H4528]] closing [[H5462]] and locking [[H5274]] the doors [[H1817]] of the upper room [[H5944]] behind him. [[H5774]] 
24 After Ehud [[H1931]] was gone, [[H3318]] Eglon’s servants [[H5650]] came in [[H935]] and found [[H2009]] the doors [[H1817]] of the upstairs room [[H5944]] locked. [[H5274]] “He must be [[H1931]] relieving [[H5526]] himself in the cool [[H4747]] room,” [[H2315]] they said. [[H559]] 
25 So they waited [[H2342]] until [[H5704]] they became worried [[H954]] and saw [[H2009]] that he had still not [[H369]] opened [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] of the upper room. [[H5944]] Then they took [[H3947]] the key [[H4668]] and opened [the doors]— [[H6605]] and there [[H2009]] was their lord [[H113]] lying [[H5307]] dead [[H4191]] on the floor. [[H776]] 
26 Ehud, however, [[H164]] had escaped [[H4422]] while [[H5704]] the servants waited. [[H4102]] He [[H1931]] passed by [[H5674]] the idols [[H6456]] and escaped [[H4422]] to Seirah. [[H8167]] 
27 On arriving [in Seirah], [[H935]] he blew [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] throughout the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim. [[H669]] The Israelites [[H1121]] came down [[H3381]] with him [[H5973]] from [[H4480]] the hills, [[H2022]] and he became their leader. [[H1931]] 
28 “Follow me,” [[H7291]] he told them, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has delivered [[H5414]] your enemies [[H341]] the Moabites [[H4124]] into your hands.” [[H3027]] So they followed him down [[H3381]] and seized [[H3920]] the fords [[H4569]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] leading to Moab, [[H4124]] and did not [[H3808]] allow [[H5414]] anyone [[H376]] to cross over. [[H5674]] 
29 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] they struck down [[H5221]] about ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] Moabites, [[H4124]] all [[H3605]] robust [[H8082]] and valiant [[H2428]] men. [[H376]] Not [[H3808]] one [[H376]] of them escaped. [[H4422]] 
30 So Moab [[H4124]] was subdued [[H3665]] under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and the land [[H776]] had rest [[H8252]] for eighty [[H8084]] years. [[H8141]] 
31 After Ehud [[H310]] came [[H1961]] Shamgar [[H8044]] son [[H1121]] of Anath. [[H6067]] And he too [[H1931]] delivered [[H3467]] Israel, [[H3478]] striking down [[H5221]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] Philistines [[H6430]] with an oxgoad. [[H4451]]
