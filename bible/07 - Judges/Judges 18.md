# Judges 18
[[Judges 17|←]] • [[Judges 19|→]]
1 In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] there was no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Israel, [[H3478]] [and] the tribe [[H7626]] of the Danites [[H1839]] was looking for [[H1245]] territory [[H5159]] to occupy. [[H3427]] For [[H3588]] up to [[H5704]] that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] they had not [[H3808]] come into [[H5307]] an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
2 So the Danites [[H1121]] sent out [[H7971]] five [[H2568]] men [[H376]] from their clans, [[H4940]] valiant warriors [[H1121]] from Zorah [[H6881]] and Eshtaol, [[H847]] to spy out [[H7270]] the land [[H776]] and explore it. [[H2713]] “Go [[H1980]] and explore [[H2713]] the land,” [[H776]] they told them. [[H559]] [The men] entered [[H935]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and came to [[H5704]] the house [[H1004]] of Micah, [[H4318]] where they spent the night. [[H3885]] 
3 And while they [[H1992]] were near [[H5973]] Micah’s [[H4318]] house, [[H1004]] they [[H1992]] recognized [[H5234]] the voice [[H6963]] of the young [[H5288]] Levite; [[H3881]] so they went over [[H5493]] and asked [[H559]] him,  “Who [[H4310]] brought [[H935]] you here? [[H1988]] What [[H4100]] are you [[H859]] doing [[H6213]] in this [place]? [[H2088]] Why [[H4100]] are you  here? [[H6311]] 
4 “Micah [[H4318]] had done [[H6213]] this [[H2090]] for me,”  he replied, [[H559]] “and he has hired me [[H7936]] to be [[H1961]] his  priest.” [[H3548]] 
5 Then they said to him, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] inqu [[H7592]] [[H430]] [[H3045]] [[H587]] [[H6743]] [[H1870]] 
6 And the priest [[H3548]] told [[H559]] them,  “Go [[H1980]] in peace. [[H7965]] The LORD [[H3068]] is watching over [[H5227]] your journey.” [[H1870]] 
7 So the five [[H2568]] men [[H376]] departed [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] to Laish, [[H3919]] where they saw [[H7200]] that the people [[H5971]] were living [[H3427]] securely, [[H983]] like [[H4941]] the Sidonians, [[H6722]] tranquil [[H8252]] and unsuspecting. [[H982]] There was nothing [[H369]] lacking [[H3637]] in the land [[H776]] and no oppressive [[H3423]] ruler. [[H6114]] And they [[H1992]] were far away [[H7350]] from the Sidonians [[H6722]] and had no [[H369]] alliance [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] anyone. [[H120]] 
8 When the men returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] Zorah [[H6881]] and Eshtaol, [[H847]] their brothers [[H251]] asked [[H559]] them,  “What [[H4100]] did you find?” [[H859]] 
9 They answered, [[H559]] “Come on, [[H6965]] let us go up [[H5927]] against them, [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] we have seen [[H7200]] the land, [[H776]] and it is very [[H3966]] good. [[H2896]] Why would you fail to act? [[H859]] Do not [[H408]] hesitate [[H6101]] to go there [[H1980]] and take possession of [[H3423]] the land! [[H776]] 
10 When you enter, [[H935]] you will come [[H935]] to [[H413]] an unsuspecting [[H982]] people [[H5971]] and a spacious [[H7342]] land, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has given it [[H5414]] into your hands. [[H3027]] It is a place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] nothing [[H369]] on earth [[H776]] is lacking.” [[H4270]] 
11 So six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] Danites [[H1839]] departed [[H5265]] from [[H8033]] Zorah [[H6881]] and Eshtaol, [[H847]] armed [[H2296]] with weapons [[H3627]] of war. [[H4421]] 
12 They went up [[H5927]] and camped [[H2583]] at Kiriath-jearim [[H7157]] in Judah. [[H3063]] That is why [[H5921]] the [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] west [[H310]] of Kiriath-jearim [[H7157]] is called [[H7121]] Mahaneh-dan [[H4265]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
13 And from there [[H8033]] they traveled [[H5674]] to the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Micah’s [[H4318]] house. [[H1004]] 
14 Then the five [[H2568]] men [[H582]] who had gone [[H1980]] to spy out [[H7270]] the land [[H776]] of Laish [[H3919]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] their brothers, [[H251]] “Did you know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] one of these [[H428]] houses [[H1004]] has [[H3426]] an ephod, [[H646]] household gods, [[H8655]] a graven image, [[H6459]] and a molten idol? [[H4541]] Now [[H6258]] think about [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] you should do. [[H6213]] 
15 So they turned [[H5493]] aside there [[H8033]] and went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the home [[H1004]] of the young [[H5288]] Levite, [[H3881]] the house [[H1004]] of Micah, [[H4318]] and greeted [[H7592]] him. [[H7965]] 
16 The six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] Danite [[H1121]] men [[H376]] stood [[H5324]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate, [[H8179]] armed [[H2296]] with their weapons [[H3627]] of war, [[H4421]] 
17 while the five [[H2568]] men [[H376]] who had gone [[H1980]] to scout [[H7270]] out the land [[H776]] went inside [[H935]] and took [[H3947]] the graven image, [[H6456]] the ephod, [[H646]] the household idols, [[H8655]] and [[H853]] the molten idol, [[H4541]] while the priest [[H3548]] stood [[H5324]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] with the six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] armed [[H2296]] men. [[H376]] 
18 When they [[H428]] entered [[H935]] Micah’s [[H4318]] house [[H1004]] and took [[H3947]] the graven image, [[H6459]] the ephod, [[H646]] the household idols, [[H8655]] and [[H853]] the molten idol, [[H4541]] the priest [[H3548]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “What [[H4100]] are you [[H859]] doing?” [[H6213]] 
19 “Be quiet,” [[H2790]] they told him. [[H559]] “Put [[H7760]] your hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] your mouth [[H6310]] and come [[H1980]] with us [[H5973]] and be [[H1961]] a father [[H1]] and a priest [[H3548]] to us.  Is it better [[H2896]] for you to be [[H1961]] a priest [[H3548]] for the house [[H1004]] of one [[H259]] person [[H376]] or [[H176]] a priest [[H3548]] for a tribe [[H7626]] and family [[H4940]] in Israel?” [[H3478]] 
20 So the priest [[H3548]] was glad [[H3190]] and took [[H3947]] the ephod, [[H646]] the household idols, [[H8655]] and [[H853]] the graven image, [[H6459]] and went [[H935]] with [[H7130]] the people. [[H5971]] 
21 Putting [[H7760]] their small children, [[H2945]] their livestock, [[H4735]] and their possessions [[H3520]] in front of them, [[H6440]] they turned [[H6437]] and departed. [[H1980]] 
22 After they [[H1992]] were some distance [[H7368]] from Micah’s [[H4318]] house, [[H1004]] the men [[H582]] in the houses [[H1004]] near [[H5973]] Micah's [[H4318]] house [[H1004]] mobilized [[H2199]] and overtook [[H1692]] the Danites. [[H1121]] 
23 When they called out [[H7121]] after them, [[H413]] the Danites [[H1121]] turned [[H5437]] to face them [[H6440]] and said [[H559]] to Micah, [[H4318]] “What is the matter [[H4100]] with you that [[H3588]] you have called out such a company?” [[H2199]] 
24 He replied, [[H559]] “You took [[H3947]] the gods [[H430]] I had made, [[H6213]] and my priest, [[H3548]] and went away. [[H1980]] What else [[H5750]] do I have? [[H4100]] How [[H4100]] can you say [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘What is the matter with you?’” [[H4100]] 
25 The Danites [[H1121]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Do not [[H408]] raise [[H8085]] your voice [[H6963]] against us, [[H5973]] or [[H6435]] angry [[H4751]] men [[H376]] will attack you, [[H6293]] and you and your family [[H1004]] will lose [[H622]] your lives.” [[H5315]] 
26 So the Danites [[H1121]] went [[H1980]] on their way, [[H1870]] and Micah turned [[H6437]] to go back [[H7725]] home, [[H1004]] because he [[H4318]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] were too strong [[H2389]] for him. [[H4480]] 
27 After they [[H1992]] had taken [[H3947]] Micah's [[H4318]] [idols] [[H834]] and his priest, [[H3548]] they went [[H935]] to [[H5921]] Laish, [[H3919]] to [[H5921]] a tranquil [[H8252]] and unsuspecting [[H982]] people, [[H5971]] and they struck [[H5221]] them [[H853]] with their swords [[H2719]] and burned down [[H8313]] the city. [[H5892]] 
28 There was no one [[H369]] to deliver them, [[H5337]] because [[H3588]] [the city was ] [[H1931]] far [[H7350]] from Sidon [[H6721]] and had no [[H369]] alliance [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] anyone; [[H120]] it [[H1931]] was in a valley [[H6010]] near [[H834]] Beth-rehob. [[H1050]] And the Danites rebuilt [[H1129]] the city [[H5892]] and lived [[H3427]] there.  
29 They named [[H7121]] [it] [[H5892]] Dan, [[H1835]] after [[H8034]] their forefather [[H1]] Dan, [[H1835]] who [[H834]] was born [[H3205]] to Israel— [[H3478]] though [[H199]] the city [[H5892]] was formerly [[H7223]] named [[H8034]] Laish. [[H3919]] 
30 The Danites [[H1121]] set up [[H6965]] idols [[H6459]] for themselves,  and Jonathan [[H3129]] son of [[H1121]] Gershom, [[H1647]] the son [[H1121]] of Moses, [[H4519]] and his sons [[H1121]] were [[H1961]] priests [[H3548]] for the tribe [[H7626]] of Dan [[H1839]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of the captivity [[H1540]] of the land. [[H776]] 
31 So they set up [[H7760]] for themselves  Micah's [[H4318]] graven image, [[H6459]] and it was there the whole [[H3605]] time [[H3117]] the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] in Shiloh. [[H7887]]
