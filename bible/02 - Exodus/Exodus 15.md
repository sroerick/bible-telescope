# Exodus 15
[[Exodus 14|←]] • [[Exodus 16|→]]
1 Then [[H227]] Moses [[H4872]] and the Israelites [[H1121]] sang [[H7891]] this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] “I will sing [[H7891]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He is highly exalted. [[H1342]] The horse [[H5483]] and rider [[H7392]] He has thrown [[H7411]] into the sea. [[H3220]] 
2 The LORD [[H3050]] is my strength [[H5797]] and my song, [[H2176]] and He has become [[H1961]] my salvation. [[H3444]] He [is] [[H2088]] my God, [[H410]] and I will praise Him, [[H5115]] my father’s [[H1]] God, [[H430]] and I will exalt Him. [[H7311]] 
3 The LORD [[H3068]] is a warrior, [[H376]] the LORD [[H3068]] is His name. [[H8034]] 
4 Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] chariots [[H4818]] and army [[H2426]] He has thrown [[H3384]] into the sea; [[H3220]] the finest [[H4005]] of his officers [[H7991]] are drowned [[H2883]] in the Red [[H5488]] Sea. [[H3220]] 
5 The depths [[H8415]] have covered them; [[H3680]] they sank [[H3381]] [there] [[H4688]] like [[H3644]] a stone. [[H68]] 
6 Your right hand, [[H3225]] O LORD, [[H3068]] is majestic [[H142]] in power; [[H3581]] Your right hand, [[H3225]] O LORD, [[H3068]] has shattered [[H7492]] the enemy. [[H341]] 
7 You overthrew [[H2040]] Your adversaries [[H6965]] by Your great [[H7230]] majesty. [[H1347]] You unleashed [[H7971]] Your burning wrath; [[H2740]] it consumed [[H398]] them like stubble. [[H7179]] 
8 At the blast [[H7307]] of Your nostrils [[H639]] the waters [[H4325]] piled up; [[H6192]] like [[H3644]] a wall [[H5067]] the currents [[H5140]] stood firm; [[H5324]] the depths [[H8415]] congealed [[H7087]] in the heart [[H3820]] of the sea. [[H3220]] 
9 The enemy [[H341]] declared, [[H559]] ‘I will pursue, [[H7291]] I will overtake. [[H5381]] I will divide [[H2505]] the spoils; [[H7998]] I will gorge myself on them. [[H4390]] I will draw [[H7324]] my sword; [[H2719]] my hand [[H3027]] will destroy them.’ [[H3423]] 
10 But You blew [[H5398]] with Your breath, [[H7307]] and the sea [[H3220]] covered them. [[H3680]] They sank [[H6749]] like lead [[H5777]] in the mighty [[H117]] waters. [[H4325]] 
11 Who [[H4310]] among the gods [[H410]] is like You, [[H3644]] O LORD? [[H3068]] Who [[H4310]] is like You— [[H3644]] majestic [[H142]] in holiness, [[H6944]] revered [[H3372]] with praises, [[H8416]] performing [[H6213]] wonders? [[H6382]] 
12 You stretched out [[H5186]] Your right hand, [[H3225]] and the earth [[H776]] swallowed them up. [[H1104]] 
13 With loving devotion [[H2617]] You will lead [[H5148]] the people [[H5971]] You have redeemed; [[H1350]] with Your strength [[H5797]] You will guide them [[H5095]] to [[H413]] Your holy [[H6944]] dwelling. [[H5116]] 
14 The nations [[H5971]] will hear [[H8085]] [and] tremble; [[H7264]] anguish [[H2427]] will grip [[H270]] the dwellers [[H3427]] of Philistia. [[H6429]] 
15 Then [[H227]] the chiefs [[H441]] of Edom [[H123]] will be dismayed; [[H926]] trembling [[H7461]] will seize [[H270]] the leaders [[H352]] of Moab; [[H4124]] those who dwell [[H3427]] in Canaan [[H3667]] will melt away, [[H4127]] 
16 and terror [[H367]] and dread [[H6343]] will fall [[H5307]] on them. [[H5921]] By the power [[H1419]] of Your arm [[H2220]] they will be as still [[H1826]] as a stone [[H68]] until [[H5704]] Your people [[H5971]] pass by, [[H5674]] O LORD, [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] the people [[H5971]] You bought [[H7069]] pass by. [[H5674]] 
17 You will bring them in [[H935]] and plant them [[H5193]] on the mountain [[H2022]] of Your inheritance— [[H5159]] the place, [[H4349]] O LORD, [[H3068]] You have prepared [[H6466]] for Your dwelling, [[H3427]] the sanctuary, [[H4720]] O Lord, [[H136]] Your hands [[H3027]] have established. [[H3559]] 
18 The LORD [[H3068]] will reign [[H4427]] forever [[H5769]] and ever!” [[H5703]] 
19 For when [[H3588]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] horses, [[H5483]] chariots, [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H6571]] went [[H935]] into the sea, [[H3220]] the LORD [[H3068]] brought the waters [[H4325]] of the sea [[H3220]] back [[H7725]] over them. [[H5921]] But the Israelites [[H1121]] walked [[H1980]] through [[H8432]] the sea [[H3220]] on dry ground. [[H3004]] 
20 Then Miriam [[H4813]] the prophetess, [[H5031]] Aaron’s [[H175]] sister, [[H269]] took [[H3947]] a tambourine [[H8596]] in her hand, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] the women [[H802]] followed her [[H3318]] with tambourines [[H8596]] and dancing. [[H4246]] 
21 And Miriam [[H4813]] sang back [[H6030]] to them:  “Sing [[H7891]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He is highly exalted; [[H1342]] the horse [[H5483]] and rider [[H7392]] He has thrown [[H7411]] into the sea.” [[H3220]] 
22 Then Moses [[H4872]] led [[H5265]] Israel [[H3478]] from the Red [[H5488]] Sea, [[H3220]] and they went out [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the Desert [[H4057]] of Shur. [[H7793]] For three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] they walked [[H1980]] in the desert [[H4057]] without [[H3808]] finding [[H4672]] water. [[H4325]] 
23 And when they came [[H935]] to Marah, [[H4785]] they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] the water [[H4325]] [there] [[H4785]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1992]] was bitter. [[H4751]] (That is why [[H5921]] it was named [[H7121]] Marah.) [[H4785]] 
24 So the people [[H5971]] grumbled [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] are we to drink?” [[H8354]] 
25 And [Moses] cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and the LORD [[H3068]] showed him [[H3384]] a log. [[H6086]] And when he cast it [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the waters, [[H4325]] [they] [[H4325]] were sweetened. [[H4985]] There [[H8033]] [the LORD] made [[H7760]] for them  a statute [[H2706]] and an ordinance, [[H4941]] and there [[H8033]] He tested them, [[H5254]] 
26 saying, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you will listen carefully [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and do [[H6213]] what is right [[H3477]] in His eyes, [[H5869]] and pay attention [[H238]] to His commands, [[H4687]] and keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] His statutes, [[H2706]] [then] I will not [[H3808]] bring [[H7760]] on you [[H5921]] any [[H3605]] of the diseases [[H4245]] I inflicted [[H7760]] on the Egyptians. [[H4713]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] who heals you. [[H7495]] 
27 Then they came [[H935]] to Elim, [[H362]] where [[H8033]] there were twelve [[H8147]] springs [[H5869]] of water [[H4325]] and seventy [[H7657]] palm trees, [[H8558]] and they camped [[H2583]] there [[H8033]] by [[H5921]] the waters. [[H4325]]
