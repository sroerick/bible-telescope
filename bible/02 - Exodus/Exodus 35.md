[[Exodus 34|←]] • [[Exodus 36|→]]
1 Then Moses [[H4872]] assembled [[H6950]] the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] and said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “These [[H428]] are the things [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded [[H6680]] you to do: [[H6213]] 
2 For six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] work [[H4399]] shall be done, [[H6213]] but on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] you are to have [[H1961]] a holy [[H6944]] Sabbath [[H7676]] of complete rest [[H7677]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Anyone [[H3605]] who does [[H6213]] work [[H4399]] on [that day]  must be put to death. [[H4191]] 
3 Do not [[H3808]] light [[H1197]] a fire [[H784]] in any [[H3605]] of your dwellings [[H4186]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day.” [[H3117]] 
4 Moses also [[H4872]] told [[H559]] the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the Israelites, [[H3478]] “This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded: [[H6680]] 
5 Take [[H3947]] from among you [[H853]] an offering [[H8641]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Let everyone [[H3605]] whose heart [[H3820]] is willing [[H5081]] bring [[H935]] to the LORD [[H3068]] an offering [[H8641]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] and bronze, [[H5178]] 
6 of blue [[H8504]] and purple [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] of fine linen [[H8336]] and goat hair, [[H5795]] 
7 of ram [[H352]] skins [[H5785]] dyed red, [[H119]] fine leather, [[H8476]] and acacia [[H7848]] wood, [[H6086]] 
8 of olive oil [[H8081]] for the light [[H3974]] and spices [[H1314]] for the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and for the fragrant [[H5561]] incense, [[H7004]] 
9 and of onyx stones [[H68]] and gemstones [[H68]] to be mounted [[H4394]] on the ephod [[H646]] and breastpiece. [[H2833]] 
10 Let every [[H3605]] skilled craftsman [[H2450]] among you  come [[H935]] and make [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded: [[H6680]] 
11 the tabernacle [[H4908]] with its tent [[H168]] and covering, [[H4372]] its clasps [[H7165]] and frames, [[H7175]] its crossbars, [[H1280]] posts, [[H5982]] and bases; [[H134]] 
12 the ark [[H727]] with its poles [[H905]] and mercy seat, [[H3727]] and the veil [[H6532]] to shield it; [[H4539]] 
13 the table [[H7979]] with its poles, [[H905]] all [[H3605]] its utensils, [[H3627]] and the Bread [[H3899]] of the Presence; [[H6440]] 
14 the lampstand [[H4501]] for light [[H3974]] with its accessories [[H3627]] and lamps [[H5216]] and oil [[H8081]] for the light; [[H3974]] 
15 the altar [[H4196]] of incense [[H7004]] with its poles; [[H905]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and fragrant [[H5561]] incense; [[H7004]] the curtain [[H4539]] for the doorway [[H6607]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the tabernacle; [[H4908]] 
16 the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] with its bronze [[H5178]] grate, [[H4345]] its poles, [[H905]] and all [[H3605]] its utensils; [[H3627]] the basin [[H3595]] with its stand; [[H3653]] 
17 the curtains [[H7050]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] with its posts [[H5982]] and bases, [[H134]] and the curtain [[H4539]] for the gate [[H8179]] of the courtyard; [[H2691]] 
18 the tent pegs [[H3489]] for the tabernacle [[H4908]] [and] [[H3489]] for the courtyard, [[H2691]] along with their ropes; [[H4340]] 
19 and the woven [[H8278]] garments [[H899]] for ministering [[H8334]] in the holy [place]— [[H6944]] both the sacred [[H6944]] garments [[H899]] for Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] and the garments [[H899]] for his sons [[H1121]] to serve as priests.” [[H3547]] 
20 Then the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] withdrew [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of Moses. [[H4872]] 
21 And everyone [[H3605]] whose [[H834]] heart [[H3820]] stirred him [[H5375]] and [[H3605]] whose [[H834]] spirit [[H7307]] prompted [[H5068]] him [[H853]] came [[H935]] and brought [[H935]] an offering [[H8641]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for the work [[H4399]] on the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] for all [[H3605]] its services, [[H5656]] and for the sacred [[H6944]] garments. [[H899]] 
22 So all [[H3605]] who had willing [[H5081]] hearts, [[H3820]] both men [[H582]] and [[H5921]] women, [[H802]] came [[H935]] [and] brought [[H935]] brooches [[H2397]] and earrings, [[H5141]] rings [[H2885]] and necklaces, [[H3558]] and all kinds [[H3605]] of gold [[H2091]] jewelry. [[H3627]] And they all [[H3605]] presented [[H5130]] their gold [[H2091]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
23 Everyone [[H3605]] who [[H834]] had [[H854]] blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] or scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] or fine linen, [[H8336]] goat hair, [[H5795]] ram [[H352]] skins [[H5785]] dyed red, [[H119]] or articles of fine leather [[H8476]] brought them. [[H935]] 
24 And all [[H3605]] who could present [[H7311]] an offering [[H8641]] of silver [[H3701]] or bronze [[H5178]] brought [[H935]] it [[H853]] as a contribution [[H8641]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Also, everyone [[H3605]] who [[H834]] had [[H4672]] acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] for any [[H3605]] part [[H4399]] of the service [[H5656]] brought it. [[H935]] 
25 Every [[H3605]] skilled [[H2450]] woman [[H802]] spun [[H2901]] with her hands [[H3027]] and brought [[H935]] what she had spun: [[H4299]] blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] or scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] or fine linen. [[H8336]] 
26 And all [[H3605]] the skilled women [[H802]] whose [[H834]] hearts [[H3820]] were stirred [[H5375]] spun [[H2901]] the goat hair. [[H5795]] 
27 The leaders [[H5387]] brought [[H935]] onyx [[H7718]] stones [[H68]] and gemstones [[H68]] to mount [[H4394]] on the ephod [[H646]] and breastpiece, [[H2833]] 
28 as well as spices [[H1314]] and olive oil [[H8081]] for the light, [[H3974]] for the anointing [[H4888]] oil, [[H8081]] and for the fragrant [[H5561]] incense. [[H7004]] 
29 So all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] and women [[H802]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] whose [[H834]] hearts [[H3820]] prompted [[H5068]] them [[H853]] brought [[H935]] a freewill offering [[H5071]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] through [[H3027]] Moses [[H4872]] had commanded [[H6680]] them to do. [[H6213]] 
30 Then Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “See, [[H7200]] the LORD [[H3068]] has called [[H7121]] by name [[H8034]] Bezalel [[H1212]] son [[H1121]] of Uri, [[H221]] the son [[H1121]] of Hur, [[H2354]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
31 And He has filled [[H4390]] him [[H853]] with the Spirit [[H7307]] of God, [[H430]] with wisdom, [[H2451]] understanding, [[H1847]] and ability [[H8394]] in all kinds [[H3605]] of crafts, [[H4399]] 
32 to make [[H2803]] artistic designs [[H4284]] for working [[H6213]] in gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] and bronze, [[H5178]] 
33 to cut [[H2799]] gemstones [[H68]] for mounting, [[H4390]] and to carve [[H2799]] wood [[H6086]] for work [[H6213]] in every [[H3605]] artistic craft. [[H4284]] 
34 And [the LORD] [[H3820]] has given [[H5414]] both him [[H1931]] and Oholiab [[H171]] son [[H1121]] of Ahisamach, [[H294]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan, [[H1835]] the ability to teach others. [[H3384]] 
35 He has filled [[H4390]] them with skill [[H2451]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] kinds of work [[H4399]] as engravers, [[H2796]] designers, [[H2803]] embroiderers [[H7551]] in blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn [[H8438]] and fine linen, [[H8336]] and as weavers— [[H707]] as artistic designers [[H6213]] of every kind [[H3605]] of craft.
