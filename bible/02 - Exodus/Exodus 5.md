1 Afterward, [[H310]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Let My people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] so that they may hold a feast [[H2287]] to Me  in the wilderness.’” [[H4057]] 
2 But Pharaoh [[H6547]] replied, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] is the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] I should obey [[H8085]] His voice [[H6963]] [and] let Israel [[H3478]] go? [[H7971]] I do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and [[H1571]] I will not [[H3808]] let Israel [[H3478]] go.” [[H7971]] 
3 “The God [[H430]] of the Hebrews [[H5680]] has met [[H7122]] with us,” [[H5921]] they answered. [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] let us go on [[H1980]] a three-day [[H7969]] journey [[H1870]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] or [[H6435]] He may strike [[H6293]] us with plagues [[H1698]] or [[H176]] with the sword.” [[H2719]] 
4 But the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] why [[H4100]] do you draw [[H6544]] the people [[H5971]] away from their work? [[H4639]] Get back [[H1980]] to your work!” [[H5450]] 
5 Pharaoh [[H6547]] also said, [[H559]] “Look, [[H2005]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] are now numerous, [[H7227]] and you would be stopping [[H7673]] them [[H853]] from their labor.” [[H5450]] 
6 That same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] commanded [[H6680]] the taskmasters [[H5065]] of the people [[H5971]] and their foremen: [[H7860]] 
7 “You shall no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] supply [[H5414]] the people [[H5971]] with straw [[H8401]] for making [[H3835]] bricks. [[H3843]] They [[H1992]] must go [[H1980]] and gather [[H7197]] their own  straw. [[H8401]] 
8 But require [[H7760]] of them [[H5921]] the same quota [[H4971]] of bricks [[H3843]] as [[H1992]] before; [[H8543]] do not [[H3808]] reduce it. [[H1639]] For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are lazy; [[H7503]] that is why [[H5921]] they [[H1992]] are crying out, [[H6817]] ‘Let us go [[H1980]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] to our God.’ [[H430]] 
9 Make the work harder [[H3513]] on [[H5921]] the men [[H376]] so they will be occupied [[H6213]] and pay no attention [[H8159]] to [these] lies.” [[H8267]] 
10 So the taskmasters [[H5065]] and foremen [[H7860]] of the people [[H5971]] went out [[H3318]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] them, [[H5971]] “This is what [[H3541]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] says: [[H559]] ‘I am no longer [[H369]] giving [[H5414]] you  straw. [[H8401]] 
11 Go [[H1980]] and get [[H3947]] your own  straw [[H8401]] wherever [[H834]] you can find it; [[H4672]] but [[H3588]] your workload [[H5656]] will in no way [[H369]] be reduced.’” [[H1639]] 
12 So the people [[H5971]] scattered [[H6327]] all over [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to gather [[H7197]] stubble [[H7179]] for straw. [[H8401]] 
13 The taskmasters [[H5065]] kept pressing them, [[H213]] saying, [[H559]] “Fulfill [[H3615]] your quota [[H1697]] each day, [[H3117]] just as you did when [[H834]] straw [[H8401]] was provided.” [[H1961]] 
14 Then the Israelite [[H1121]] foremen, [[H7860]] whom [[H834]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] taskmasters [[H5065]] had set [[H7760]] over the people, [[H5921]] were beaten [[H5221]] and asked, [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] have you not [[H3808]] fulfilled [[H3615]] your quota [[H2706]] of bricks [[H3835]] yesterday [[H8543]] or today, [[H1571]] as you did before?” [[H8543]] 
15 So the Israelite [[H1121]] foremen [[H7860]] went [[H935]] and appealed [[H6817]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] “Why [[H4100]] are you treating [[H6213]] your servants [[H5650]] this way? [[H3541]] 
16 No [[H369]] straw [[H8401]] has been given [[H5414]] to your servants, [[H5650]] yet we are told, [[H559]] ‘Make [[H6213]] bricks!’ [[H3843]] Look, [[H2009]] your servants [[H5650]] are being beaten, [[H5221]] but the fault [[H2398]] [is] with your own people.” [[H5971]] 
17 “You [[H859]] are slackers,” [[H7503]] Pharaoh replied. [[H559]] “Slackers! [[H7503]] That is why [[H5921]] you [[H859]] keep saying, [[H559]] ‘Let us go [[H1980]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD.’ [[H3068]] 
18 Now [[H6258]] get to [[H1980]] work. [[H5647]] You  will be given [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] straw, [[H8401]] yet you must deliver [[H5414]] the full quota [[H8506]] of bricks.” [[H3843]] 
19 The Israelite [[H1121]] foremen [[H7860]] realized [[H7200]] they were in trouble [[H7451]] when they were told, [[H559]] “You must not [[H3808]] reduce [[H1639]] your daily [[H3117]] quota [[H1697]] of bricks.” [[H3843]] 
20 When they left [[H3318]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] they confronted [[H6293]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] who stood [[H5324]] waiting to meet them. [[H7125]] 
21 “May the LORD [[H3068]] look upon you [[H7200]] and judge you,” [[H8199]] [the foremen] said, [[H559]] “for [[H834]] you have made us a stench [[H887]] before [[H5869]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and his officials; [[H5650]] you have placed [[H5414]] in their hand [[H3027]] a sword [[H2719]] to kill us!” [[H2026]] 
22 So Moses [[H4872]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] and asked, [[H559]] “Lord, [[H136]] why [[H4100]] have You brought trouble [[H7489]] upon this [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]] Is this [[H2088]] why [[H4100]] You sent me? [[H7971]] 
23 Ever since [[H227]] I went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] to speak [[H1696]] in Your name, [[H8034]] he has brought trouble [[H7489]] on this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and You have not [[H3808]] delivered [[H5337]] Your people [[H5971]] in any way.” [[H5337]]
