# Exodus 2
[[Exodus 1|←]] • [[Exodus 3|→]]
1 Now a man [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] of Levi [[H3878]] married [[H3947]] a Levite [[H3878]] woman, [[H1323]] 
2 and she [[H802]] conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] When she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he [was a] [[H1931]] beautiful [child], [[H2896]] she hid [[H6845]] him for three [[H7969]] months. [[H3391]] 
3 But when she could [[H3201]] no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] hide him, [[H6845]] she got [[H3947]] him  a papyrus [[H1573]] basket [[H8392]] and coated it [[H2560]] with tar [[H2564]] and pitch. [[H2203]] Then she placed [[H7760]] the child [[H3206]] in  [the basket] [[H853]] and set [[H7760]] it among the reeds [[H5488]] along [[H5921]] the bank [[H8193]] of the Nile. [[H2975]] 
4 And his sister [[H269]] stood [[H3320]] at a distance [[H7350]] to see [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] would happen [[H6213]] to him.  
5 Soon the daughter [[H1323]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] went down [[H3381]] to bathe [[H7364]] in [[H5921]] the Nile, [[H2975]] and her attendants [[H5291]] were walking [[H1980]] along [[H5921]] the riverbank. [[H3027]] And when she saw [[H7200]] the basket [[H8392]] among [[H8432]] the reeds, [[H5488]] she sent [[H7971]] her maidservant [[H519]] to retrieve it. [[H3947]] 
6 When she opened it, [[H6605]] she saw [[H7200]] the child, [[H3206]] and behold, [[H2009]] the little boy [[H5288]] was crying. [[H1058]] So she had compassion [[H2550]] on him [[H5921]] and said, [[H559]] “This is one of [[H2088]] the Hebrew [[H5680]] children.” [[H3206]] 
7 Then his sister [[H269]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] daughter, [[H1323]] “Shall I go [[H1980]] and call [[H7121]] one of [[H4480]] the Hebrew [[H5680]] women [[H802]] to nurse [[H3243]] the child for you?” [[H3206]] 
8 “Go ahead,” [[H1980]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] daughter [[H1323]] told her. [[H559]] And the girl [[H5959]] went [[H1980]] and called [[H7121]] the boy’s [[H3206]] mother. [[H517]] 
9 Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] daughter [[H1323]] said [[H559]] to her,  “Take [[H1980]] this [[H2088]] child [[H3206]] and nurse him for me, [[H3243]] and I [[H589]] will pay [[H5414]] your wages.” [[H7939]] So the woman [[H802]] took [[H3947]] the boy [[H3206]] and nursed him. [[H5134]] 
10 When the child [[H3206]] grew older, [[H1431]] she brought him [[H935]] to Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] daughter, [[H1323]] and he became [[H1961]] her son. [[H1121]] She named [[H7121]] him Moses [[H4872]] and explained, [[H559]] “I drew him out [[H4871]] of [[H4480]] the water.” [[H4325]] 
11 One day, [[H3117]] after Moses [[H4872]] had grown up, [[H1431]] he went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] his own people [[H251]] and observed [[H7200]] their hard labor. [[H5450]] He saw [[H7200]] an Egyptian [[H4713]] beating [[H5221]] a Hebrew, [[H5680]] one of his own people. [[H251]] 
12 After looking [[H6437]] all around [[H3541]] and seeing [[H7200]] no [[H369]] one, [[H376]] he struck down [[H5221]] the Egyptian [[H4713]] and hid his body [[H2934]] in the sand. [[H2344]] 
13 The next [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] [Moses] went out [[H3318]] and saw [[H2009]] two [[H8147]] Hebrews [[H5680]] fighting. [[H5327]] He asked [[H559]] the one in the wrong, [[H7563]] “Why [[H4100]] are you attacking [[H5221]] your fellow [Hebrew]?” [[H7453]] 
14 But the man replied, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] made [[H7760]] you [[H376]] ruler [[H8269]] and judge [[H8199]] over us? [[H5921]] Are you [[H859]] planning [[H559]] to kill [[H2026]] me as [[H834]] you killed [[H2026]] the Egyptian?” [[H4713]] Then Moses [[H4872]] was afraid [[H3372]] and thought, [[H559]] “This thing I have done [[H1697]] has surely [[H403]] become known.” [[H3045]] 
15 When Pharaoh [[H6547]] heard [[H8085]] about this matter, [[H2088]] he sought [[H1245]] to kill [[H2026]] Moses. [[H4872]] But Moses [[H4872]] fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and settled [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Midian, [[H4080]] where he sat down [[H3427]] beside [[H5921]] a well. [[H875]] 
16 Now the priest [[H3548]] of Midian [[H4080]] had seven [[H7651]] daughters, [[H1323]] and they came [[H935]] to draw water [[H1802]] and fill [[H4390]] the troughs [[H7298]] to water [[H8248]] their father’s [[H1]] flock. [[H6629]] 
17 And when some shepherds [[H7462]] came along [[H935]] and drove them away, [[H1644]] Moses [[H4872]] stood up [[H6965]] and came to their rescue [[H3467]] and watered [[H8248]] their flock. [[H6629]] 
18 When [the daughters] returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] their father [[H1]] Reuel, [[H7467]] he asked them, [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] have you returned [[H935]] so early [[H4116]] today?” [[H3117]] 
19 “An Egyptian [[H4713]] rescued [[H5337]] us from [[H3027]] the shepherds,” [[H7462]] they replied. [[H559]] “He even [[H1571]] drew water [[H1802]] for us and watered [[H8248]] the flock.” [[H6629]] 
20 “So where is he?” [[H346]] [their father] asked. [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] did you leave the man [[H376]] behind? [[H5800]] Invite [[H7121]] him  to have something to eat.” [[H398]] 
21 Moses [[H4872]] agreed [[H2974]] to stay [[H3427]] with [[H854]] the man, [[H376]] and he gave [[H5414]] his daughter [[H1323]] Zipporah [[H6855]] to Moses in marriage. [[H4872]] 
22 And she gave birth to [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] whom he named [[H7121]] Gershom, [[H1647]] for [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] “I have become [[H1961]] a stranger [[H1616]] in a strange [[H5237]] land.” [[H776]] 
23 After a long [[H7227]] time, [[H3117]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] died. [[H4191]] The Israelites [[H1121]] groaned [[H584]] and cried out [[H2199]] under their [[H4480]] burden of slavery, [[H5656]] and their cry for deliverance [[H7775]] from [[H4480]] bondage [[H5656]] ascended [[H5927]] to [[H413]] God. [[H430]] 
24 So God [[H430]] heard [[H8085]] their groaning, [[H5009]] and He [[H430]] remembered [[H2142]] His covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob. [[H3290]] 
25 God [[H430]] saw [[H7200]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and [[H430]] took notice. [[H3045]]
