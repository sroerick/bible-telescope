# Exodus 18
[[Exodus 17|←]] • [[Exodus 19|→]]
1 Now Moses’ [[H4872]] father-in-law [[H2859]] Jethro, [[H3503]] the priest [[H3548]] of Midian, [[H4080]] heard [[H8085]] about all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] had done [[H6213]] for Moses [[H4872]] and His people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and how [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had brought [[H3318]] Israel [[H3478]] out of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
2 After [[H310]] Moses [[H4872]] had sent back [[H7964]] his wife [[H802]] Zipporah, [[H6855]] [his] [[H4872]] father-in-law [[H2859]] Jethro [[H3503]] had taken her in, [[H3947]] 
3 along with her two [[H8147]] sons. [[H1121]] One [[H259]] [son] [[H834]] was named [[H8034]] Gershom, [[H1647]] for [[H3588]] Moses had said, [[H559]] “I have been [[H1961]] a foreigner [[H1616]] in a foreign [[H5237]] land.” [[H776]] 
4 The other [son] [[H259]] was named [[H8034]] Eliezer, [[H461]] because [Moses had said], [[H3588]] “The God [[H430]] of my father [[H1]] was my helper [[H5828]] and delivered me [[H5337]] from the sword [[H2719]] of Pharaoh.” [[H6547]] 
5 Moses’ father-in-law [[H2859]] Jethro, [[H3503]] along with Moses’ [[H4872]] wife [[H802]] and sons, [[H1121]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] him [[H4872]] in [[H413]] the desert, [[H4057]] where [[H834]] he [[H1931]] was encamped [[H2583]] at the mountain [[H2022]] of God. [[H430]] 
6 He sent word [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “I, [[H589]] your father-in-law [[H2859]] Jethro, [[H3503]] am coming [[H935]] to [[H413]] you with your wife [[H802]] and her [[H5973]] two [[H8147]] sons.” [[H1121]] 
7 So Moses [[H4872]] went out to meet [[H3318]] his father-in-law [[H2859]] and bowed down [[H7812]] and kissed him. [[H5401]] They greeted [[H7592]] each [[H376]] other [[H7453]] and went [[H935]] into the tent. [[H168]] 
8 Then Moses [[H4872]] recounted [[H5608]] to his father-in-law [[H2859]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had done [[H6213]] to Pharaoh [[H6547]] and the Egyptians [[H4714]] for [[H5921]] Israel’s [[H3478]] sake, [[H182]] all [[H3605]] the hardships [[H8513]] they had encountered [[H4672]] along the way, [[H1870]] and how the LORD [[H3068]] had delivered them. [[H5337]] 
9 And Jethro [[H3503]] rejoiced [[H2302]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the good things [[H2896]] the LORD [[H3068]] had done [[H6213]] for Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] He had rescued [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians. [[H4713]] 
10 Jethro [[H3503]] declared, [[H559]] “Praise [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] has delivered [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians [[H4713]] and of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and who [[H834]] has rescued [[H5337]] the people [[H5971]] from [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians. [[H4713]] 
11 Now [[H6258]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is greater [[H1419]] than all other [[H3605]] gods, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] He did this [[H1697]] when they [[H834]] treated Israel arrogantly.” [[H2102]] 
12 Then Moses’ [[H4872]] father-in-law [[H2859]] Jethro [[H3503]] brought [[H3947]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] and sacrifices [[H2077]] to God, [[H430]] and Aaron [[H175]] came [[H935]] with all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] to eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] with [[H5973]] Moses’ [[H4872]] father-in-law [[H2859]] in the presence [[H6440]] of God. [[H430]] 
13 The next day [[H4283]] Moses [[H4872]] took his seat [[H3427]] to judge [[H8199]] the people, [[H5971]] and they stood [[H5975]] around [[H5921]] [him] [[H4872]] from [[H4480]] morning [[H1242]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
14 When [his] [[H4872]] father-in-law [[H2859]] saw [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] [Moses] [[H1931]] was doing [[H6213]] for the people, [[H5971]] he asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] is this [[H2088]] that [[H834]] you are [[H859]] doing [[H6213]] for the people? [[H5971]] Why [[H4069]] do you [[H859]] sit [[H3427]] alone [as judge], [[H910]] with all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] standing [[H5324]] around [[H5921]] you from [[H4480]] morning [[H1242]] till [[H5704]] evening? [[H6153]] 
15 “Because [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] me to inquire [[H1875]] of God,” [[H430]] Moses [[H4872]] replied. [[H559]] 
16 “Whenever [[H3588]] they have [[H1961]] a dispute, [[H1697]] it is brought [[H935]] to me [[H413]] to judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] one man [[H376]] and another, [[H7453]] and I make known [[H3045]] to them [[H853]] the statutes [[H2706]] and [[H853]] laws [[H8451]] of God.” [[H430]] 
17 But Moses’ [[H4872]] father-in-law [[H2859]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “What [[H1697]] you are [[H859]] doing [[H6213]] is not [[H3808]] good. [[H2896]] 
18 Surely [[H1571]] you [[H859]] and [[H1571]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] with you [[H5973]] will wear yourselves out, [[H5034]] because [[H3588]] the task [[H1697]] is too heavy [[H3515]] for you. [[H4480]] You cannot [[H3808]] handle [[H6213]] it alone. [[H910]] 
19 Now [[H6258]] listen to me; [[H8085]] I will give you some advice, [[H3289]] and may God [[H430]] be [[H1961]] with you. [[H5973]] You [[H859]] must be [[H1961]] the people’s representative [[H5971]] before [[H4136]] God [[H430]] and bring [[H935]] their causes [[H1697]] to [[H413]] Him. [[H430]] 
20 Teach [[H2094]] them the statutes [[H2706]] and laws, [[H8451]] and show [[H3045]] them the way [[H1870]] to live [[H1980]] and the work [[H4639]] they must do. [[H6213]] 
21 Furthermore, [[H859]] select [[H2372]] capable [[H2428]] men [[H376]] from among [[H3605]] the people— [[H5971]] God-fearing, [[H3373]] trustworthy men [[H571]] who are averse [[H8130]] to dishonest gain. [[H1215]] Appoint them [[H7760]] over [the people] [[H5921]] as leaders [[H8269]] of thousands, [[H505]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] of fifties, [[H2572]] and of tens. [[H6235]] 
22 Have [these men] judge [[H8199]] the people [[H5971]] at all [[H3605]] times. [[H6256]] Then [[H1961]] they can bring [[H935]] you [[H413]] any [[H3605]] major [[H1419]] issue, [[H1697]] but all [[H3605]] minor [[H6996]] cases [[H1697]] they can judge [[H8199]] on their own, [[H1992]] so that your load may be lightened [[H7043]] as they share [[H5375]] it with you. [[H854]] 
23 If [[H518]] you follow [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] advice [[H1697]] and God [[H430]] so directs you, [[H6680]] you will be able [[H3201]] to endure, [[H5975]] and [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] can go [[H935]] home [[H4725]] in peace.” [[H7965]] 
24 Moses [[H4872]] listened [[H8085]] to his father-in-law [[H2859]] and did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] he said. [[H559]] 
25 So Moses [[H4872]] chose [[H977]] capable [[H2428]] men [[H582]] from all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and made [[H5414]] them heads [[H7218]] over [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] as leaders [[H8269]] of thousands, [[H505]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] of fifties, [[H2572]] and of tens. [[H6235]] 
26 And they judged [[H8199]] the people [[H5971]] at all [[H3605]] times; [[H6256]] they would bring [[H935]] the difficult [[H7186]] cases [[H1697]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] but any [[H3605]] minor [[H6996]] issue [[H1697]] they would judge [[H8199]] themselves. [[H1992]] 
27 Then Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] his father-in-law {on his way}, [[H2859]] and [Jethro] returned [[H1980]] to [[H413]] his own land. [[H776]]
