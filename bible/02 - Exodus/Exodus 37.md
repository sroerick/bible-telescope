[[Exodus 36|←]] • [[Exodus 38|→]]
1 Bezalel went on [[H1212]] to make [[H6213]] the ark [[H727]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood, [[H6086]] two [[H520]] and a half cubits [[H2677]] long, [[H753]] a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] wide, [[H7341]] and a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] high. [[H6967]] 
2 He overlaid [[H6823]] it with pure [[H2889]] gold, [[H2091]] both inside [[H1004]] and out, [[H2351]] and made [[H6213]] a gold [[H2091]] molding [[H2213]] all around it. [[H5439]] 
3 And he cast [[H3332]] four [[H702]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] for [[H5921]] its four [[H702]] feet, [[H6471]] two [[H8147]] on [[H5921]] one [[H259]] side [[H6763]] and two [[H8147]] on [[H5921]] the other. [[H8145]] 
4 Then he made [[H6213]] poles [[H905]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] and overlaid [[H6823]] them with gold. [[H2091]] 
5 He inserted [[H935]] the poles [[H905]] into the rings [[H2885]] on [[H5921]] the sides [[H6763]] of the ark [[H727]] for carrying [[H5375]] [it]. [[H727]] 
6 He constructed [[H6213]] a mercy seat [[H3727]] of pure [[H2889]] gold, [[H2091]] two [[H520]] and a half cubits [[H2677]] long [[H753]] and a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] wide. [[H7341]] 
7 He made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] cherubim [[H3742]] of hammered [[H4749]] of gold [[H2091]] [at the] [[H8147]] ends [[H7098]] of the mercy seat, [[H3727]] 
8 one [[H259]] cherub [[H3742]] on [[H4480]] one [[H2088]] end [[H7098]] of the mercy seat [[H3727]] and one [[H259]] on the other, [[H2088]] [all] made [[H6213]] from one piece. [[H7118]] 
9 And the cherubim [[H3742]] had wings [[H3671]] that spread [[H6566]] upward. [[H4605]] They faced [[H6440]] each [[H376]] other [[H251]] and overshadowed [[H5526]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] with their wings, [[H3671]] their faces [[H6440]] looking toward [[H413]] the mercy seat. [[H3727]] 
10 He made [[H6213]] the table [[H7979]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood, [[H6086]] two cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] a cubit [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] high. [[H6967]] 
11 He overlaid [[H6823]] it [[H853]] with pure [[H2889]] gold [[H2091]] and made [[H6213]] a gold [[H2091]] molding [[H2213]] all around it. [[H5439]] 
12 He also made [[H6213]] a rim [[H4526]] around [[H5439]] it  a handbreadth wide [[H2948]] and put [[H6213]] a gold [[H2091]] molding [[H2213]] on [[H5439]] the rim. [[H4526]] 
13 He cast [[H3332]] four [[H702]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] for [the table]  and fastened [[H5414]] [them] [[H2885]] to [[H5921]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H6285]] at its four [[H702]] legs. [[H7272]] 
14 The rings [[H2885]] were placed [[H1961]] next to [[H5980]] the frame [[H4526]] as holders [[H1004]] for the poles [[H905]] used to carry [[H5375]] the table. [[H7979]] 
15 He made [[H6213]] the poles [[H905]] [of] acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] for carrying [[H5375]] the table [[H7979]] and overlaid [[H6823]] them with gold. [[H2091]] 
16 He also made [[H6213]] the utensils [[H3627]] for [[H5921]] the table [[H7979]] out of pure [[H2889]] gold: [[H2091]] its plates [[H7086]] and dishes, [[H3709]] as well as its bowls [[H4518]] and pitchers [[H7184]] for pouring drink offerings. [[H5258]] 
17 Then he made [[H6213]] the lampstand [[H4501]] out of pure [[H2889]] hammered [[H4749]] gold, [[H2091]] all of one piece: [[H4480]] its base [[H3409]] and shaft, [[H7070]] its ornamental cups, [[H1375]] and its buds [[H3730]] and petals. [[H6525]] 
18 Six [[H8337]] branches [[H7070]] extended [[H3318]] from the sides, [[H6654]] three [[H7969]] on one [[H259]] side [[H6654]] and three [[H7969]] on the other. [[H8145]] 
19 There were three [[H7969]] cups [[H1375]] shaped like almond blossoms [[H8246]] on the first [[H259]] branch, [[H7070]] each with buds [[H3730]] and petals, [[H6525]] three [[H7969]] on the next [[H259]] branch, [[H7070]] and the same [[H3651]] for all six [[H8337]] branches [[H7070]] that extended [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the lampstand. [[H4501]] 
20 On the lampstand [[H4501]] were four [[H702]] cups [[H1375]] shaped like almond flowers [[H8246]] with buds [[H3730]] and petals. [[H6525]] 
21 A bud [[H3730]] was under [[H8478]] the first pair [[H8147]] of branches [[H7070]] that extended [[H3318]] from [the lampstand], [[H4480]] a bud [[H3730]] under [[H8478]] the second pair, [[H8147]] and a bud [[H3730]] under [[H8478]] the third pair. [[H8147]] 
22 The buds [[H3730]] and branches [[H7070]] were [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] of one piece [with the lampstand], [[H4480]] which was a single [[H259]] hammered [[H4749]] piece of pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]] 
23 He also made [[H6213]] its seven [[H7651]] lamps, [[H5216]] its wick trimmers, [[H4457]] and trays [[H4289]] of pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]] 
24 He made [[H6213]] [the lampstand] [[H853]] and all [[H3605]] its utensils [[H3627]] from a talent [[H3603]] of pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]] 
25 He made [[H6213]] the altar [[H4196]] of incense [[H7004]] out of acacia [[H7848]] wood. [[H6086]] It was square, [[H7251]] a cubit [[H520]] long, [[H753]] a cubit [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and two cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]] Its horns [[H7161]] were [[H1961]] of one piece. [[H4480]] 
26 And he overlaid [[H6823]] it [[H853]] with pure [[H2889]] gold, [[H2091]] its top [[H1406]] and [[H853]] its sides [[H7023]] all around, [[H5439]] and its horns. [[H7161]] Then he made [[H6213]] a gold [[H2091]] molding [[H2213]] all around it. [[H5439]] 
27 He made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] below [[H8478]] the molding [[H2213]] on [[H5921]] opposite sides [[H6654]] to hold [[H1004]] the poles [[H905]] used to carry [[H5375]] it. [[H853]] 
28 And he made [[H6213]] the poles [[H905]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] and overlaid [[H6823]] them with gold. [[H2091]] 
29 He also made [[H6213]] the sacred [[H6944]] anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and the pure, [[H2889]] fragrant [[H5561]] incense, [[H7004]] [the work] of a perfumer. [[H7543]]
