# Exodus 13
[[Exodus 12|←]] • [[Exodus 14|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Consecrate [[H6942]] to Me  every [[H3605]] firstborn male. [[H1060]] The firstborn [[H6363]] from every [[H3605]] womb [[H7358]] among the Israelites [[H1121]] belongs [[H1931]] to Me,  [both] of man [[H120]] and beast.” [[H929]] 
3 So Moses [[H4872]] told [[H559]] the people, [[H5971]] “Remember [[H2142]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] [the day] [[H834]] you came out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery; [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] brought you out [[H3318]] of it [[H2088]] by the strength [[H2392]] of His hand. [[H3027]] And nothing [[H3808]] leavened [[H2557]] shall be eaten. [[H398]] 
4 Today, [[H3117]] in the month [[H2320]] of Abib, [[H24]] you [[H859]] are leaving. [[H3318]] 
5 And [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] brings [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Amorites, [[H567]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites— [[H2983]] [the land] [[H834]] He swore [[H7650]] to your fathers [[H1]] that He would give [[H5414]] you,  a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey— [[H1706]] you shall keep [[H5647]] this [[H2063]] service [[H5656]] in this [[H2088]] month. [[H2320]] 
6 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] you are to eat [[H398]] unleavened bread, [[H4682]] and on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] there shall be a feast [[H2282]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 Unleavened bread [[H4682]] shall be eaten [[H398]] during those seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] Nothing [[H3808]] leavened [[H2557]] may be found among you, [[H7200]] nor shall [[H3808]] yeast [[H7603]] be found [[H7200]] anywhere within [[H3605]] your  borders. [[H1366]] 
8 And on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] you are to explain [[H5046]] to your son, [[H1121]] ‘This is because of [[H5668]] what [[H2088]] the LORD [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] for me  when I came out [[H3318]] of Egypt.’ [[H4714]] 
9 It shall be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] for you  on [[H5921]] your hand [[H3027]] and a reminder [[H2146]] on your forehead [[H996]] that [[H4616]] the law [[H8451]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is to be [[H1961]] on your lips. [[H6310]] For [[H3588]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] the LORD [[H3068]] brought you out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
10 Therefore you shall keep [[H8104]] this [[H2063]] ordinance [[H2708]] at the appointed time [[H4150]] year [[H3117]] after year. [[H3117]] 
11 And [[H1961]] after [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] brings [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites [[H3669]] and gives it to you, [[H5414]] as [[H834]] He swore [[H7650]] to you  and your fathers, [[H1]] 
12 you are to present [[H5674]] to the LORD [[H3068]] the firstborn male [[H6363]] of every [[H3605]] womb. [[H7358]] All [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H6363]] males [[H2145]] of your [[H1961]] livestock [[H929]] [belong to] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 You must redeem [[H6299]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H6363]] donkey [[H2543]] with a lamb, [[H7716]] and if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] redeem it, [[H6299]] you are to break its neck. [[H6202]] And every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H1060]] of your sons [[H1121]] you must redeem. [[H6299]] 
14 In the future, [[H4279]] when [[H3588]] your son [[H1121]] asks you, [[H7592]] ‘What [[H4100]] does this [[H2063]] mean?’ [[H559]] you are to tell [[H559]] him, [[H413]] ‘With a mighty [[H2392]] hand [[H3027]] the LORD [[H3068]] brought us out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery. [[H5650]] 
15 And [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] stubbornly refused [[H7185]] to let us go, [[H7971]] the LORD [[H3068]] killed [[H2026]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H1060]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] both [[H1060]] of man [[H120]] and [[H5704]] beast. [[H929]] This is why [[H5921]] I [[H589]] sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] the firstborn [[H6363]] male [[H2145]] of every [[H3605]] womb, [[H7358]] but I redeem [[H6299]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of my sons. [[H1121]] 
16 So it shall serve as [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] on [[H5921]] your hand [[H3027]] and a symbol [[H2903]] on your forehead, [[H996]] for [[H3588]] with a mighty [[H2392]] hand [[H3027]] the LORD [[H3068]] brought us out [[H3318]] of Egypt.” [[H4714]] 
17 When Pharaoh [[H6547]] let the people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] God [[H430]] did not [[H3808]] lead them [[H5148]] along the road [[H1870]] through the land [[H776]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] though [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] was shorter. [[H7138]] For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “If [the people] face [[H7200]] war, [[H4421]] [they] [[H5971]] might change their minds [[H5162]] and return [[H7725]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] 
18 So God [[H430]] led the people [[H5971]] around [[H5437]] by the way [[H1870]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] toward the Red [[H5488]] Sea. [[H3220]] And the Israelites [[H1121]] left [[H5927]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] arrayed for battle. [[H2571]] 
19 Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the bones [[H6106]] of Joseph [[H3130]] with him [[H5973]] because [[H3588]] {Joseph had made} the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] swear a solemn oath [[H7650]] when he said, [[H559]] “God [[H430]] will surely attend to you, [[H6485]] and you shall carry [[H5927]] my bones [[H6106]] with you [[H854]] from this place.” [[H2088]] 
20 They set out [[H5265]] from Succoth [[H5523]] and camped [[H2583]] at Etham [[H864]] on the edge [[H7097]] of the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
21 And the LORD [[H3068]] went [[H1980]] before them [[H6440]] in a pillar [[H5982]] of cloud [[H6051]] to guide [[H5148]] their way [[H1870]] by day, [[H3119]] and in a pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] to give them light [[H215]] at night, [[H3915]] so that they could travel [[H1980]] by day [[H3119]] or night. [[H3915]] 
22 Neither [[H3808]] the pillar [[H5982]] of cloud [[H6051]] by day [[H3119]] nor the pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] by night [[H3915]] left [[H4185]] its place before [[H6440]] the people. [[H5971]]
