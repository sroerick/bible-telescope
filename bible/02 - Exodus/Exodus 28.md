[[Exodus 27|←]] • [[Exodus 29|→]]
1 Next, [[H859]] bring near [[H7126]] to you [[H413]] your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] from among [[H8432]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] along with [[H854]] his sons [[H1121]] Nadab, [[H5070]] Abihu, [[H30]] Eleazar, [[H499]] and Ithamar, [[H385]] to serve Me as priests. [[H3547]] 
2 Make [[H6213]] holy [[H6944]] garments [[H899]] for your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] to give him dignity [[H3519]] and splendor. [[H8597]] 
3 You [[H859]] are to instruct [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the skilled craftsmen, [[H2450]] whom [[H834]] I have filled [[H4390]] with a spirit [[H7307]] of wisdom, [[H2451]] to make [[H6213]] garments [[H899]] for Aaron’s [[H175]] consecration, [[H6942]] so that he may serve Me as priest. [[H3547]] 
4 These [[H428]] are the garments [[H899]] that [[H834]] they shall make: [[H6213]] a breastpiece, [[H2833]] an ephod, [[H646]] a robe, [[H4598]] a woven [[H8665]] tunic, [[H3801]] a turban, [[H4701]] and a sash. [[H73]] They are to make [[H6213]] [these] holy [[H6944]] garments [[H899]] for your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons, [[H1121]] so that they may serve Me as priests. [[H3547]] 
5 They [[H1992]] shall use [[H3947]] gold, [[H2091]] along with [[H853]] blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and fine linen. [[H8336]] 
6 [The craftsmen] are to make [[H6213]] the ephod [[H646]] of finely spun [[H7806]] linen [[H8336]] embroidered with gold, [[H2091]] and with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn. [[H8438]] 
7 It shall have [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] shoulder pieces [[H3802]] joined [[H2266]] at [[H413]] its two [[H8147]] ends, [[H7098]] so it can be fastened. [[H2266]] 
8 The skillfully woven waistband [[H2805]] of [[H5921]] the ephod [[H642]] must be [[H1961]] of one piece, [[H4480]] of the same workmanship— [[H4639]] with gold, [[H2091]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and with finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]] 
9 Take [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] onyx [[H7718]] stones [[H68]] and engrave [[H6605]] on [[H5921]] them the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] 
10 six [[H8337]] of their names [[H8034]] on [[H5921]] one [[H259]] stone [[H68]] and the remaining [[H3498]] six [[H8337]] on [[H5921]] the other, [[H8145]] in the order of their birth. [[H8435]] 
11 Engrave [[H6605]] the two [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] with [[H5921]] the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to be set [[H4142]] as a gem [[H68]] cutter [[H2796]] engraves [[H6603]] a seal. [[H2368]] Mount [[H6213]] [the stones] [[H853]] in gold [[H2091]] filigree settings. [[H4865]] 
12 Fasten [[H7760]] both [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] onto [[H5921]] the shoulder pieces [[H3802]] of the ephod [[H646]] as memorial [[H2146]] stones [[H68]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Aaron [[H175]] is to bear [[H5375]] their names [[H8034]] on [[H5921]] his two [[H8147]] shoulders [[H3802]] as a memorial [[H2146]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 Fashion [[H6213]] gold [[H2091]] filigree settings [[H4865]] 
14 and two [[H8147]] chains [[H8333]] of pure [[H2889]] gold, [[H2091]] made [[H6213]] of braided [[H4020]] cord [[H5688]] work; [[H4639]] and attach [[H5414]] [these] [[H5688]] chains [[H8333]] to [[H5921]] the settings. [[H4865]] 
15 You are also to make [[H6213]] a breastpiece [[H2833]] of judgment [[H4941]] with the same workmanship [[H4639]] as the ephod. [[H646]] Construct [[H6213]] it [[H853]] with gold, [[H2091]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]] 
16 It must be [[H1961]] square [[H7251]] when folded over double, [[H3717]] a span [[H2239]] long [[H753]] and a span [[H2239]] wide. [[H7341]] 
17 And mount [[H4390]] on it  a setting [[H4396]] of gemstones, [[H68]] four [[H702]] rows [[H2905]] of stones: [[H68]] In the first [[H259]] row there shall be [[H2905]] a ruby, [[H124]] a topaz, [[H6357]] and an emerald; [[H1304]] 
18 in the second [[H8145]] row [[H2905]] a turquoise, [[H5306]] a sapphire, [[H5601]] and a diamond; [[H3095]] 
19 in the third [[H7992]] row [[H2905]] a jacinth, [[H3958]] an agate, [[H7618]] and an amethyst; [[H306]] 
20 and in the fourth [[H7243]] row [[H2905]] a beryl, [[H8658]] an onyx, [[H7718]] and a jasper. [[H3471]] Mount [these stones] [[H1961]] in gold [[H2091]] filigree settings. [[H4396]] 
21 The twelve [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] are [[H1961]] to [[H5921]] correspond to the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] each [[H376]] engraved [[H6603]] like a seal [[H2368]] with [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of one of the twelve [[H8147]] tribes. [[H7626]] 
22 For the breastpiece [[H2833]] make [[H6213]] braided chains [[H1383]] like cords [[H5688]] of pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]] 
23 Make [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] and attach [[H5414]] them [[H8147]] to [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] corners [[H7098]] of the breastpiece. [[H2833]] 
24 Then attach [[H5414]] the two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] chains [[H5688]] to [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] gold rings [[H2885]] at [[H413]] the corners [[H7098]] of the breastpiece, [[H2833]] 
25 and attach [[H5414]] the other [[H8147]] ends [[H7098]] of the two [[H8147]] chains [[H5688]] to [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] filigree settings, [[H4865]] fastening [[H5414]] them to [[H5921]] the ephod’s [[H646]] shoulder pieces [[H3802]] in [[H413]] the front. [[H4136]] 
26 Make [[H6213]] two [more] [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] and attach [[H7760]] them [[H853]] to [[H5921]] the other two [[H8147]] corners [[H7098]] of the breastpiece, [[H2833]] on [[H5921]] the edge [[H8193]] next to [[H413]] the inner [[H1004]] border of the ephod. [[H646]] 
27 Make [[H6213]] two [additional] [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] and attach [[H5414]] them to [[H5921]] the bottom [[H4295]] of the two [[H8147]] shoulder pieces [[H3802]] of the ephod, [[H646]] on its front, [[H4136]] close to [[H5980]] its seam [[H4225]] and above [[H4605]] the woven waistband [[H2805]] of the ephod. [[H646]] 
28 The rings [[H2885]] of the breastpiece [[H2833]] shall be tied [[H7405]] to [[H413]] the rings [[H2885]] of the ephod [[H646]] with a cord [[H6616]] of blue yarn, [[H8504]] so that the breastpiece [[H2833]] is [[H1961]] above [[H5921]] the waistband [[H2805]] of the ephod [[H646]] and does not [[H3808]] swing out [[H2118]] from [[H5921]] the ephod. [[H646]] 
29 Whenever [Aaron] enters [[H935]] the Holy [Place], [[H6944]] [he] [[H175]] shall bear [[H5375]] the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] over [[H5921]] his heart [[H3820]] on the breastpiece [[H2833]] of judgment, [[H4941]] as a continual [[H8548]] reminder [[H2146]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
30 And place [[H5414]] the Urim [[H224]] and Thummim [[H8550]] in [[H413]] the breastpiece [[H2833]] of judgment, [[H4941]] so that they will also be [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] Aaron’s [[H175]] heart [[H3820]] whenever he comes [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Aaron [[H175]] will continually [[H8548]] carry [[H5375]] the judgment [[H4941]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] over [[H5921]] his heart [[H3820]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
31 You are to make [[H6213]] the robe [[H4598]] of the ephod [[H646]] entirely [[H3632]] of blue yarn, [[H8504]] 
32 with [[H1961]] an opening [[H6310]] at its top [[H7218]] in the center. [[H8432]] Around [the opening] [[H5439]] shall be [[H1961]] a woven [[H4639]] collar [[H8193]] with an opening [[H6310]] like that [[H6310]] of a garment, [[H8473]] so that it [[H1961]] will not [[H3808]] tear. [[H7167]] 
33 Make [[H6213]] pomegranates [[H7416]] of blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn [[H8438]] all the way around the lower [[H5439]] hem, [[H7757]] with gold [[H2091]] bells [[H6472]] between [[H8432]] them, [[H5439]] 
34 so that gold [[H2091]] bells [[H6472]] and pomegranates [[H7416]] alternate around [[H5439]] the lower hem [[H7757]] of the robe. [[H4598]] 
35 Aaron [[H175]] must wear [[H5921]] the robe [[H1961]] whenever he ministers, [[H8334]] and its sound [[H6963]] will be heard [[H8085]] when he enters [[H935]] or exits [[H3318]] the sanctuary [[H6944]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] so that he will not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] 
36 You are to make [[H6213]] a plate [[H6731]] of pure [[H2889]] gold [[H2091]] and engrave on it [[H6605]] as a seal: [[H2368]] HOLY [[H6944]] TO THE LORD. [[H3068]] 
37 Fasten [[H7760]] a blue [[H8504]] cord [[H6616]] to it [[H5921]] to attach it to [[H5921]] the turban; [[H4701]] it is to be [[H1961]] on [[H413]] the front [[H4136]] of the turban. [[H4701]] 
38 It will be [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] Aaron’s [[H175]] forehead, [[H4696]] so that [he] [[H175]] may bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the holy things [[H6944]] that [[H834]] the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] consecrate [[H6942]] with regard to all [[H3605]] their holy [[H6944]] gifts. [[H4979]] It shall always [[H8548]] be [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] his forehead, [[H4696]] so that [the people] may be acceptable [[H7522]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
39 You are to weave [[H7660]] the tunic [[H3801]] with fine linen, [[H8336]] make [[H6213]] the turban [[H4701]] of fine linen, [[H8336]] and fashion [[H6213]] an embroidered [[H7551]] sash. [[H73]] 
40 Make [[H6213]] tunics, [[H3801]] sashes, [[H73]] and headbands [[H4021]] for Aaron’s [[H175]] sons, [[H1121]] to give [[H6213]] them dignity [[H3519]] and splendor. [[H8597]] 
41 After you put [[H3847]] [these garments] [[H853]] on your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons, [[H1121]] anoint [[H4886]] them, [[H853]] ordain [[H4390]] them, [[H853]] and consecrate [[H6942]] them [[H853]] so that they may serve Me as priests. [[H3547]] 
42 Make [[H6213]] linen [[H906]] undergarments [[H4370]] to cover [[H3680]] their  bare [[H6172]] flesh, [[H1320]] extending [[H1961]] from waist [[H4975]] to [[H5704]] thigh. [[H3409]] 
43 Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] must wear them [[H1961]] whenever they enter [[H935]] the tent [[H168]] of meeting [[H4150]] or [[H176]] approach [[H5066]] the altar [[H4196]] to minister [[H8334]] in the Holy [Place], [[H6944]] so that they will not [[H3808]] incur [[H5375]] guilt [[H5771]] and die. [[H4191]] This is to be a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for Aaron [[H310]] and his descendants. [[H2233]]
