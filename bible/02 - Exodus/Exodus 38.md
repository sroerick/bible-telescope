# Exodus 38
[[Exodus 37|←]] • [[Exodus 39|→]]
1 Bezalel constructed [[H6213]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] from acacia [[H7848]] wood. [[H6086]] It was square, [[H7251]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]] 
2 He made [[H6213]] a horn [[H7161]] at each of [[H5921]] its four [[H702]] corners, [[H6438]] so that the horns [and altar] [[H7161]] were [[H1961]] of one piece, [[H4480]] and he overlaid [[H6823]] [the altar] with bronze. [[H5178]] 
3 He made [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the altar’s [[H4196]] utensils [[H3627]] of bronze— [[H5178]] its pots, [[H5518]] shovels, [[H3257]] basins, [[H4219]] meat forks, [[H4207]] and firepans. [[H4289]] 
4 He made [[H6213]] a grate [[H4345]] of bronze [[H5178]] mesh [[H7568]] for the altar [[H4196]] under [[H8478]] its ledge, [[H3749]] halfway [[H2677]] up from the bottom. [[H4295]] 
5 At the four [[H702]] corners [[H7099]] of the bronze [[H5178]] grate [[H4345]] he cast [[H3332]] four [[H702]] rings [[H2885]] as holders [[H1004]] for the poles. [[H905]] 
6 And he made [[H6213]] the poles [[H905]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] and overlaid [[H6823]] them with bronze. [[H5178]] 
7 Then he inserted [[H935]] the poles [[H905]] into the rings [[H2885]] on [[H5921]] the sides [[H6763]] of the altar [[H4196]] for carrying [[H5375]] it. [[H853]] He made [[H6213]] [the altar] [[H853]] with boards [[H3871]] so that it was hollow. [[H5014]] 
8 Next, he made [[H6213]] the bronze [[H5178]] basin [[H3595]] and its stand [[H3653]] from the mirrors [[H4759]] of the women who [[H834]] served [[H6633]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
9 Then he constructed [[H6213]] the courtyard. [[H2691]] The south [[H5045]] side [[H6285]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] was a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [long] [[H520]] [and had] curtains [[H7050]] of finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] 
10 with twenty [[H6242]] posts [[H5982]] and twenty [[H6242]] bronze [[H5178]] bases, [[H134]] and with silver [[H3701]] hooks [[H2053]] and bands [[H2838]] on the posts. [[H5982]] 
11 The north [[H6828]] side [[H6285]] [was also] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [long], [[H520]] with twenty [[H6242]] posts [[H5982]] and twenty [[H6242]] bronze [[H5178]] bases. [[H134]] The hooks [[H2053]] and bands [[H2838]] of the posts [[H5982]] were silver. [[H3701]] 
12 The west [[H3220]] side [[H6285]] [was] fifty [[H2572]] cubits long [[H520]] [and had] curtains, [[H7050]] with ten [[H6235]] posts [[H5982]] and ten [[H6235]] bases. [[H134]] The hooks [[H2053]] and bands [[H2838]] of the posts [[H5982]] were silver. [[H3701]] 
13 And the east [[H6924]] side, [[H6285]] toward the sunrise, [[H4217]] [was also] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [long]. [[H520]] 
14 The curtains [[H7050]] of [[H413]] the one side [[H3802]] [of the entrance were] fifteen [[H2568]] cubits [long], [[H520]] with three [[H7969]] posts [[H5982]] and three [[H7969]] bases. [[H134]] 
15 And the curtains [[H7050]] for the other [[H8145]] side [[H3802]] were also fifteen [[H2568]] cubits long, [[H520]] with three [[H7969]] posts [[H5982]] and three [[H7969]] bases [[H134]] [as well]. [[H2088]] 
16 All [[H3605]] the curtains [[H7050]] around [[H5439]] the courtyard [[H2691]] were made of finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]] 
17 The bases [[H134]] for the posts [[H5982]] were bronze, [[H5178]] the hooks [[H2053]] and bands [[H2838]] were silver, [[H3701]] and the plating [[H6826]] for the tops [[H7218]] of the posts was silver. [[H3701]] So all [[H3605]] the posts [[H5982]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] were banded [[H2836]] with silver. [[H3701]] 
18 The curtain [[H4539]] for the entrance [[H8179]] to the courtyard [[H2691]] was embroidered [[H7551]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]] [It was] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and, like [[H5980]] the curtains [[H7050]] of the courtyard, [[H2691]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H6967]] 
19 with four [[H702]] posts [[H5982]] and four [[H702]] bronze [[H5178]] bases. [[H134]] Their hooks [[H2053]] were silver, [[H3701]] as well as the bands [[H2838]] and the plating [[H6826]] of their tops. [[H7218]] 
20 All [[H3605]] the tent pegs [[H3489]] for the tabernacle [[H4908]] and for the surrounding [[H5439]] courtyard [[H2691]] were bronze. [[H5178]] 
21 This [[H428]] is the inventory [[H6485]] for the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Testimony, [[H5715]] as [[H834]] recorded [[H6485]] at [[H5921]] Moses’ [[H4872]] command [[H6310]] by [[H5656]] the Levites [[H3881]] under the direction [[H3027]] of Ithamar [[H385]] son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
22 Bezalel [[H1212]] son [[H1121]] of Uri, [[H221]] son [[H1121]] of Hur, [[H2354]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah, [[H3063]] made [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
23 With him [was] [[H854]] Aholiab [[H171]] son [[H1121]] of Ahisamach, [[H294]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan, [[H1835]] an engraver, [[H2796]] designer, [[H2803]] and embroiderer [[H7551]] in blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn [[H8438]] and fine linen. [[H8336]] 
24 All [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] from the wave offering [[H8573]] used [[H6213]] for the work [[H4399]] on the sanctuary [[H6944]] totaled [[H1961]] 29 [[H8672]] talents [[H3603]] and 730 [[H7651]] shekels, [[H8255]] according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel. [[H8255]] 
25 The silver [[H3701]] from those numbered [[H6485]] among the congregation [[H5712]] totaled 100 [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] and 1,775 [[H505]] shekels, [[H8255]] according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel— [[H8255]] 
26 a beka [[H1235]] per person, [[H1538]] [that is], half [[H4276]] a shekel, [[H8255]] according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel, [[H8255]] from everyone [[H3605]] twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who had crossed over [[H5674]] to [[H5921]] be numbered, [[H6485]] a total of 603,550 [[H8337]] men. [[H2572]] 
27 The hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] were [[H1961]] used to cast [[H3332]] the bases [[H134]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] and the bases [[H134]] of the curtain— [[H6532]] 100 [[H3967]] bases [[H134]] from the 100 [[H3967]] talents, [[H3603]] one talent [[H3603]] per base. [[H134]] 
28 With the 1,775 [shekels of silver], [[H505]] he made [[H6213]] the hooks [[H2053]] for the posts, [[H5982]] overlaid [[H6823]] their tops, [[H7218]] and supplied bands [[H2836]] for them. [[H853]] 
29 The bronze [[H5178]] from the wave offering [[H8573]] totaled 70 [[H7657]] talents [[H3603]] and 2,400 [[H505]] shekels. [[H8255]] 
30 He used it to make [[H6213]] the bases [[H134]] for the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] the bronze [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] and its bronze [[H5178]] grating, [[H4345]] all [[H3605]] the utensils [[H3627]] for the altar, [[H4196]] 
31 the bases [[H134]] for the surrounding [[H5439]] courtyard [[H2691]] [and] [[H134]] the gate [[H8179]] of the courtyard, [[H2691]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the tent pegs [[H3489]] for the tabernacle [[H4908]] and [[H3605]] the surrounding [[H5439]] courtyard. [[H2691]]
