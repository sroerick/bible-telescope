# Exodus 17
[[Exodus 16|←]] • [[Exodus 18|→]]
1 Then the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H1121]] left [[H5265]] the Desert [[H4057]] of Sin, [[H5512]] moving from place to place [[H4550]] as [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded. [[H6310]] They camped [[H2583]] at Rephidim, [[H7508]] but there was no [[H369]] water [[H4325]] for the people [[H5971]] to drink. [[H8354]] 
2 So the people [[H5971]] contended [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Give [[H5414]] us water [[H4325]] to drink.” [[H8354]] “Why [[H4100]] do you contend [[H7378]] with me?” [[H5978]] Moses [[H4872]] replied. [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] do you test [[H5254]] the LORD?” [[H3068]] 
3 But the people [[H5971]] thirsted [[H6770]] for water [[H4325]] there, [[H8033]] and they grumbled [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses: [[H4872]] “Why [[H4100]] have you brought us [[H5927]] out of Egypt— [[H4714]] to kill [[H4191]] us and our children [[H1121]] and livestock [[H4735]] with thirst?” [[H6772]] 
4 Then Moses [[H4872]] cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “What [[H4100]] should I do [[H6213]] with these [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]] A little more [[H5750]] and they will stone me!” [[H5619]] 
5 The LORD [[H3068]] answered [[H559]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Walk on [[H5674]] ahead of [[H6440]] the people [[H5971]] and take [[H3947]] some of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] with you. [[H854]] Take along [[H3947]] in your hand [[H3027]] the staff [[H4294]] with which [[H834]] you struck [[H5221]] the Nile, [[H2975]] and go. [[H1980]] 
6 Behold, [[H2005]] I will stand [[H5975]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] you [[H5921]] by the rock [[H6697]] at Horeb; [[H2722]] when you strike [[H5221]] the rock, [[H6697]] water [[H4325]] will come out [[H3318]] of it [[H4480]] for the people [[H5971]] to drink.” [[H8354]] So Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] this [[H3651]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
7 He named [[H7121]] the place [[H4725]] Massah [[H4532]] and Meribah [[H4809]] because [[H5921]] the Israelites [[H1121]] quarreled, [[H7379]] and because [[H5921]] they tested [[H5254]] the LORD, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] “Is [[H3426]] the LORD [[H3068]] among us [[H7130]] or [[H518]] not?” [[H369]] 
8 After this, the Amalekites [[H6002]] came [[H935]] and attacked [[H3898]] the Israelites [[H3478]] at Rephidim. [[H7508]] 
9 So Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Choose [[H977]] some of our men [[H376]] and go out [[H3318]] to fight [[H3898]] the Amalekites. [[H6002]] Tomorrow [[H4279]] I [[H595]] will stand [[H5324]] on [[H5921]] the hilltop [[H7218]] with the staff [[H4294]] of God [[H430]] in my hand.” [[H3027]] 
10 Joshua [[H3091]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had instructed [[H559]] him  and fought [[H3898]] against the Amalekites, [[H6002]] while Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and Hur [[H2354]] went up [[H5927]] to the top [[H7218]] of the hill. [[H1389]] 
11 As long as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] held up [[H7311]] his hands, [[H3027]] Israel [[H3478]] prevailed; [[H1396]] but when [[H834]] he lowered [[H5117]] [them], [[H3027]] Amalek [[H6002]] prevailed. [[H1396]] 
12 When Moses’ [[H4872]] hands [[H3027]] grew heavy, [[H3515]] they took [[H3947]] a stone [[H68]] and put [[H7760]] it under him, [[H8478]] and he sat [[H3427]] on it. [[H5921]] Then Aaron [[H175]] and Hur [[H2354]] held [[H8551]] his hands up, [[H3027]] one [[H2088]] on each [[H259]] side, [[H259]] so that his hands [[H3027]] remained [[H1961]] steady [[H530]] until [[H5704]] the sun [[H8121]] went down. [[H935]] 
13 So Joshua [[H3091]] overwhelmed [[H2522]] Amalek [[H6002]] and his army [[H5971]] with the sword. [[H2719]] 
14 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Write this [[H3789]] on a scroll [[H5612]] as a reminder [[H2146]] and recite [[H7760]] it to Joshua, [[H3091]] because [[H3588]] I will utterly blot out [[H4229]] the memory [[H2143]] of Amalek [[H6002]] from under [[H8478]] heaven.” [[H8064]] 
15 And Moses [[H4872]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] and named [[H7121]] it [[H8034]] The LORD [[H3068]] Is My Banner. [[H5251]] 
16 “Indeed,” [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] “a hand [[H3027]] was lifted up toward [[H5921]] the throne [[H3676]] of the LORD. [[H3050]] The LORD [[H3068]] will war [[H4421]] against Amalek [[H6002]] from generation [[H1755]] to generation.” [[H1755]]
