# Exodus 39
[[Exodus 38|←]] • [[Exodus 40|→]]
1 From [[H4480]] the blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn [[H8438]] [the craftsmen] made [[H6213]] specially woven [[H8278]] garments [[H899]] for ministry [[H8334]] in the sanctuary, [[H6944]] as well as the holy [[H6944]] garments [[H899]] for Aaron, [[H175]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
2 Bezalel made [[H6213]] the ephod [[H646]] out of gold, [[H2091]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]] 
3 They hammered out [[H7554]] thin sheets [[H6341]] of gold [[H2091]] and cut [[H7112]] threads from them [[H6616]] to interweave [[H6213]] with the blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and fine linen— [[H8336]] the work [[H4639]] of a skilled craftsman. [[H2803]] 
4 They made [[H6213]] shoulder pieces [[H3802]] for [the ephod],  which were joined [[H2266]] to [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] of its corners [[H7118]] for fastening it. [[H2266]] 
5 And the skillfully woven waistband [[H2805]] of [[H5921]] the ephod [[H642]] was of one piece with the ephod, [[H4480]] with the same [[H1931]] workmanship [[H4639]] of gold, [[H2091]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
6 They mounted [[H6213]] the onyx [[H7718]] stones [[H68]] in gold [[H2091]] filigree settings, [[H4865]] engraved [[H6605]] like a seal [[H2368]] with [[H5921]] the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] 
7 and fastened [[H7760]] them on [[H5921]] the shoulder pieces [[H3802]] of the ephod [[H646]] as memorial [[H2146]] stones [[H68]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
8 He also made [[H6213]] the breastpiece [[H2833]] of gold [[H2091]] like the ephod, [[H646]] using the work [[H4639]] of a skilled [[H2803]] craftsman, [[H4639]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]] 
9 [It] [[H6213]] was square [[H7251]] and folded over double, [[H3717]] a span [[H2239]] long [[H753]] and a span [[H2239]] wide. [[H7341]] 
10 And they mounted [[H4390]] on it  four [[H702]] rows [[H2905]] of gemstones. [[H68]] The first [[H259]] row [had] [[H2905]] a ruby, [[H124]] a topaz, [[H6357]] and an emerald; [[H1304]] 
11 the second [[H8145]] row [had] [[H2905]] a turquoise, [[H5306]] a sapphire, [[H5601]] and a diamond; [[H3095]] 
12 the third [[H7992]] row [had] [[H2905]] a jacinth, [[H3958]] an agate, [[H7618]] and an amethyst; [[H306]] 
13 and the fourth [[H7243]] row [had] [[H2905]] a beryl, [[H8658]] an onyx, [[H7718]] and a jasper. [[H3471]] These were mounted [[H4142]] in gold [[H2091]] filigree [[H4865]] settings. [[H4396]] 
14 The twelve [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] corresponded to the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Each [[H376]] stone was engraved [[H6603]] like a seal [[H2368]] with [[H5921]] one of the names [[H8034]] of the twelve [[H8147]] tribes. [[H7626]] 
15 For [[H5921]] the breastpiece [[H2833]] they made [[H6213]] braided [[H1383]] chains [[H8333]] of pure [[H2889]] gold [[H2091]] cord. [[H5688]] 
16 They also fashioned [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] filigree settings [[H4865]] and two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] rings, [[H2885]] and fastened [[H5414]] the two [[H8147]] rings [[H2885]] to [[H5921]] its [[H2833]] two [[H8147]] corners. [[H7098]] 
17 Then they fastened [[H5414]] the two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] chains [[H5688]] to [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] gold rings [[H2885]] at [[H5921]] the corners [[H7098]] of the breastpiece, [[H2833]] 
18 and [[H853]] they fastened [[H5414]] the other [[H8147]] ends [[H7098]] of the two [[H8147]] chains [[H5688]] to [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] filigree settings, [[H4865]] attaching [[H5414]] them to [[H5921]] the shoulder pieces [[H3802]] of the ephod [[H646]] at [[H413]] the front. [[H4136]] 
19 They made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] other gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] and put [[H7760]] them at [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] other corners [[H7098]] of the breastpiece, [[H2833]] on [[H5921]] the inside [[H1004]] edge [[H8193]] next to [[H413]] the ephod. [[H646]] 
20 They made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] more gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] and attached [[H5414]] them to [[H5921]] the bottom [[H4295]] of the [[H8147]] shoulder pieces [[H3802]] on the front [[H4136]] of the ephod, [[H646]] near [[H5980]] the seam [[H4225]] just above [[H4605]] the woven waistband [[H2805]] of the ephod. [[H646]] 
21 Then they tied [[H7405]] the rings [[H2885]] of the breastpiece [[H2833]] to [[H413]] the rings [[H2885]] of the ephod [[H646]] with a cord [[H6616]] of blue yarn, [[H8504]] so that the breastpiece [[H2833]] was [[H1961]] above [[H5921]] the waistband [[H2805]] of the ephod [[H646]] and would not [[H3808]] come loose [[H2118]] from [[H5921]] the ephod, [[H646]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
22 They made [[H6213]] the robe [[H4598]] of the ephod [[H646]] entirely [[H3632]] of blue cloth, [[H8504]] the work [[H4639]] of a weaver, [[H707]] 
23 with an opening [[H6310]] in the center [[H8432]] of the robe [[H4598]] like that [[H6310]] of a garment, [[H8473]] with a collar [[H8193]] around [[H5439]] the opening [[H6310]] so that it would not [[H3808]] tear. [[H7167]] 
24 They made [[H6213]] pomegranates [[H7416]] of blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn [[H8438]] and finely spun linen [[H7806]] on [[H5921]] the lower hem [[H7757]] of the robe. [[H4598]] 
25 They also made [[H6213]] bells [[H6472]] of pure [[H2889]] gold [[H2091]] and attached [[H5414]] [them] [[H6472]] around [[H5439]] the hem [[H7757]] between [[H8432]] the pomegranates, [[H7416]] 
26 alternating [[H5439]] bells [[H6472]] and pomegranates [[H7416]] around the lower hem [[H7757]] of the robe [[H4598]] to be worn for ministry, [[H8334]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
27 For Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] they made [[H6213]] tunics [[H3801]] of fine linen, [[H8336]] the work [[H4639]] of a weaver, [[H707]] 
28 as well as [[H853]] the turban [[H4701]] of fine linen, [[H8336]] the ornate [[H6287]] headbands [[H4021]] and [[H853]] undergarments [[H4370]] [of] finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] 
29 and the sash [[H73]] of finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] embroidered with [[H7551]] blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
30 They also made [[H6213]] the plate [[H6731]] of the holy [[H6944]] crown [[H5145]] [of] pure [[H2889]] gold, [[H2091]] and they engraved [[H3789]] on it, [[H5921]] like an inscription [[H4385]] on a seal: [[H2368]] HOLY [[H6944]] TO THE LORD. [[H3068]] 
31 Then they fastened [[H5414]] to it [[H5921]] a cord [[H6616]] of blue yarn [[H8504]] it in order to mount [[H5414]] it to [[H5921]] the turban, [[H4701]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
32 So all [[H3605]] the work [[H5656]] for the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] was completed. [[H3615]] The Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
33 Then they brought [[H935]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] to [[H413]] Moses: [[H4872]] the tent [[H168]] with all [[H3605]] its furnishings, [[H3627]] its clasps, [[H7165]] its frames, [[H7175]] its crossbars, [[H1280]] and its posts [[H5982]] and bases; [[H134]] 
34 the covering [[H4372]] of ram [[H352]] skins [[H5785]] dyed red, [[H119]] the covering [[H4372]] of fine leather, [[H8476]] and [[H853]] the veil [[H6532]] of the covering; [[H4539]] 
35 the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] with its poles [[H905]] and the mercy seat; [[H3727]] 
36 the table [[H7979]] with all [[H3605]] its utensils [[H3627]] and the Bread [[H3899]] of the Presence; [[H6440]] 
37 the pure [[H2889]] gold lampstand [[H4501]] with its row of lamps [[H5216]] and all [[H3605]] its utensils, [[H3627]] as well as the oil [[H8081]] for the light; [[H3974]] 
38 the gold [[H2091]] altar, [[H4196]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil, [[H8081]] the fragrant [[H5561]] incense, [[H7004]] and the curtain [[H4539]] for the entrance [[H6607]] to the tent; [[H168]] 
39 the bronze [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] with its bronze [[H5178]] grating, [[H4345]] its poles, [[H905]] and all [[H3605]] its utensils; [[H3627]] the basin [[H3595]] with its stand; [[H3653]] 
40 the curtains [[H7050]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] with its posts [[H5982]] and bases, [[H134]] the curtain [[H4539]] for the gate [[H8179]] of the courtyard, [[H2691]] its ropes [[H4340]] and tent pegs, [[H3489]] and all [[H3605]] the equipment [[H3627]] for the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting; [[H4150]] 
41 and the woven [[H8278]] garments [[H899]] for ministering [[H8334]] in the sanctuary, [[H6944]] both the sacred [[H6944]] garments [[H899]] for Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] and the garments [[H899]] for his sons [[H1121]] to serve as priests. [[H3547]] 
42 The Israelites [[H1121]] had done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H5656]] just as [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
43 And Moses [[H4872]] inspected [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] and saw that [[H2009]] they had accomplished [[H6213]] it [[H853]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded. [[H6680]] So Moses [[H4872]] blessed them. [[H1288]]
