# Exodus 7
[[Exodus 6|←]] • [[Exodus 8|→]]
1 The LORD [[H3068]] answered [[H559]] Moses, [[H4872]] “See, [[H7200]] I have made [[H5414]] you like God [[H430]] to Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] will be [[H1961]] your prophet. [[H5030]] 
2 You [[H859]] are to speak [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I command you, [[H6680]] and your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] must declare [[H1696]] it to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] so that he will let the Israelites [[H1121]] go [[H7971]] out of his land. [[H776]] 
3 But I [[H589]] will harden [[H7185]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart, [[H3820]] and though I will multiply [[H7235]] My signs [[H226]] and wonders [[H4159]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] 
4 Pharaoh [[H6547]] will not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to you. [[H413]] Then I will lay [[H5414]] My hand [[H3027]] on Egypt, [[H4714]] and by mighty [[H1419]] acts of judgment [[H8201]] I will bring [[H3318]] the divisions [[H6635]] of My people [[H5971]] the Israelites [[H1121]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
5 And the Egyptians [[H4713]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] when I stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4713]] and bring [[H3318]] the Israelites [[H1121]] out from among them.” [[H8432]] 
6 So Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] did [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded them. [[H6680]] 
7 Moses [[H4872]] was eighty [[H8084]] years old [[H1121]] and Aaron [[H175]] was eighty-three [[H7969]] when they spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]] 
8 The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
9 “When [[H3588]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] tells you, [[H1696]] ‘Perform [[H5414]] a miracle,’ [[H4159]] you are to say [[H559]] to Aaron, [[H175]] ‘Take [[H3947]] your staff [[H4294]] and throw it down [[H7993]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh,’ [[H6547]] [and] it {will} become [[H1961]] a serpent.” [[H8577]] 
10 So Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and did [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded. [[H6680]] Aaron [[H175]] threw [[H7993]] his staff {down} [[H4294]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and his officials, [[H5650]] and it became [[H1961]] a serpent. [[H8577]] 
11 But Pharaoh [[H6547]] called [[H7121]] the wise men [[H2450]] and sorcerers [[H3784]] and magicians [[H2748]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] did [[H6213]] the same things [[H3651]] by their magic arts. [[H3858]] 
12 Each [[H376]] one threw down [[H7993]] his staff, [[H4294]] and it became [[H1961]] a serpent. [[H8577]] But Aaron’s [[H175]] staff [[H4294]] swallowed up [[H1104]] [the other] staffs. [[H4294]] 
13 Still, Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] was hardened, [[H2388]] and he did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to them, [[H413]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said. [[H1696]] 
14 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] is stubborn; [[H3515]] he refuses [[H3985]] to let the people [[H5971]] go. [[H7971]] 
15 Go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] in the morning [[H1242]] as you see [[H2009]] him walking out [[H3318]] to the water. [[H4325]] Wait [[H5324]] on [[H5921]] the bank [[H8193]] of the Nile [[H2975]] to meet him, [[H7125]] and take [[H3947]] in your hand [[H3027]] the staff [[H4294]] that [[H834]] was changed [[H2015]] into a snake. [[H5175]] 
16 Then say [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] ‘The LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of the Hebrews, [[H5680]] has sent [[H7971]] me to tell you: [[H559]] Let My people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] so that they may worship [[H5647]] Me in the wilderness. [[H4057]] But [[H2009]] you have not [[H3808]] listened [[H8085]] until [[H5704]] now. [[H3541]] 
17 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] By this [[H2063]] you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] with the staff [[H4294]] in my hand [[H3027]] I [[H595]] will strike [[H5221]] the water [[H4325]] of the Nile, [[H2975]] and it will turn [[H2015]] to blood. [[H1818]] 
18 The fish [[H1710]] in the Nile [[H2975]] will die, [[H4191]] the river [[H2975]] will stink, [[H887]] and the Egyptians [[H4713]] will be unable [[H3811]] to drink [[H8354]] its [[H2975]] water.’” [[H4325]] 
19 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Tell [[H559]] Aaron, [[H175]] ‘Take [[H3947]] your staff [[H4294]] and stretch out [[H5186]] your hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] over [[H5921]] their rivers [[H5104]] [and] canals [[H2975]] and ponds [[H98]] and [[H5921]] reservoirs— [[H4723]] that they may become [[H1961]] blood. [[H1818]] There will be [[H1961]] blood [[H1818]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] even in the vessels of wood [[H6086]] and stone. [[H68]] 
20 Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] did [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded; [[H6680]] in the presence [[H5869]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] and his officials, [[H5650]] he raised [[H7311]] the staff [[H4294]] and struck [[H5221]] the water [[H4325]] of the Nile, [[H2975]] and all [[H3605]] the water [[H4325]] was turned [[H2015]] to blood. [[H1818]] 
21 The fish [[H1710]] in the Nile [[H2975]] died, [[H4191]] and the river [[H2975]] smelled so bad [[H887]] that the Egyptians [[H4714]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] its [[H2975]] water. [[H4325]] There was [[H1961]] blood [[H1818]] throughout [[H3605]] the land of Egypt. [[H776]] 
22 But the magicians [[H2748]] of Egypt [[H4714]] did [[H6213]] the same things [[H3651]] by their magic arts. [[H3909]] So Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] was hardened, [[H2388]] and he would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [Moses and Aaron], [[H413]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said. [[H1696]] 
23 Instead, Pharaoh [[H6547]] turned around, [[H6437]] went [[H935]] into [[H413]] his palace, [[H1004]] and did not [[H3808]] take [[H7896]] even [[H1571]] this [[H2063]] to heart. [[H3820]] 
24 So all [[H3605]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] dug [[H2658]] around [[H5439]] the Nile [[H2975]] for water [[H4325]] to drink, [[H8354]] because [[H3588]] they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] the water [[H4325]] from the river. [[H2975]] 
25 And seven [[H7651]] full days [[H3117]] passed [[H4390]] after [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] had struck [[H5221]] the Nile. [[H2975]]
