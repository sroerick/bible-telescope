# Exodus 31
[[Exodus 30|←]] • [[Exodus 32|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “See, [[H7200]] I have appointed [[H7121]] by name [[H8034]] Bezalel [[H1212]] son [[H1121]] of Uri, [[H221]] the son [[H1121]] of Hur, [[H2354]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
3 And I have filled [[H4390]] him [[H853]] with the Spirit [[H7307]] of God, [[H430]] with wisdom, [[H2451]] understanding, [[H1847]] and ability [[H8394]] in all kinds [[H3605]] of craftsmanship, [[H4399]] 
4 to design [[H2803]] artistic works in gold, [[H2091]] silver, [[H3701]] and bronze, [[H5178]] 
5 to cut [[H2799]] gemstones [[H68]] for settings, [[H4390]] and to carve [[H2799]] wood, [[H6086]] so that he may be a master [[H6213]] of every [[H3605]] craft. [[H4399]] 
6 Moreover, I [[H589]] have selected [[H5414]] Oholiab [[H171]] son [[H1121]] of Ahisamach, [[H294]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan, [[H1835]] as his assistant. [[H854]] I have also given [[H5414]] skill [[H2451]] to all [[H3605]] the craftsmen, [[H2450]] that they may fashion [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have commanded you: [[H6680]] 
7 the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] and [[H853]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] upon it, [[H5921]] and all [[H3605]] the other furnishings [[H3627]] of the tent— [[H168]] 
8 the table [[H7979]] with its utensils, [[H3627]] the pure [[H2889]] gold lampstand [[H4501]] with all [[H3605]] its utensils, [[H3627]] the altar [[H4196]] of incense, [[H7004]] 
9 the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] with all [[H3605]] its utensils, [[H3627]] and [[H853]] the basin [[H3595]] with its stand— [[H3653]] 
10 as well as [[H853]] the woven [[H8278]] garments, [[H899]] both the holy [[H6944]] garments [[H899]] for Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] and the garments [[H899]] for his sons [[H1121]] to serve as priests, [[H3547]] 
11 in addition to [[H853]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and fragrant [[H5561]] incense [[H7004]] for the Holy Place. [[H6944]] They are to make [[H6213]] them according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have commanded you.” [[H6680]] 
12 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
13 “Tell [[H1696]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘Surely [[H389]] you must observe [[H8104]] My Sabbaths, [[H7676]] for [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] will be a sign [[H226]] between Me [[H996]] and you [[H996]] for the generations to come, [[H1755]] so that you may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] who sanctifies you. [[H6942]] 
14 Observe [[H8104]] the Sabbath, [[H7676]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is holy [[H6944]] to you.  Everyone who profanes it [[H2490]] must surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]] Whoever [[H3605]] does [[H6213]] work [[H4399]] on [that day]  must be cut off [[H3772]] from [[H7130]] his people. [[H5971]] 
15 For six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] work [[H4399]] may be done, [[H6213]] but the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] must be a Sabbath [[H7676]] of solemn rest, [[H7677]] holy [[H6944]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Whoever [[H3605]] does [[H6213]] [any] work [[H4399]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day [[H3117]] must surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]] 
16 The Israelites [[H1121]] must observe [[H8104]] the Sabbath, [[H7676]] celebrating [[H6213]] it [[H7676]] as a lasting [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] 
17 It [[H1931]] is a sign [[H226]] between [[H996]] Me and the Israelites [[H1121]] forever; [[H5769]] for [[H3588]] in six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] made [[H6213]] the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth, [[H776]] but on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] He rested [[H7673]] and was refreshed.’” [[H5314]] 
18 When [the LORD] had finished [[H3615]] speaking [[H1696]] with him [[H854]] on Mount [[H2022]] Sinai, [[H5514]] He gave [[H5414]] Moses [[H4872]] the two [[H8147]] tablets [[H3871]] of the Testimony, [[H5715]] tablets [[H3871]] of stone [[H68]] inscribed [[H3789]] by the finger [[H676]] of God.
