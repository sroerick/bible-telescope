# Exodus 26
[[Exodus 25|←]] • [[Exodus 27|→]]
1 You are to construct [[H6213]] the tabernacle [itself] [[H4908]] [with] ten [[H6235]] curtains [[H3407]] of finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] [each] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] [and] cherubim [[H3742]] skillfully [[H2803]] worked [[H4639]] into them. [[H853]] 
2 Each [[H259]] curtain [[H3407]] shall be twenty-eight [[H8083]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and four [[H702]] cubits [[H520]] wide— [[H7341]] all [[H3605]] curtains [[H3407]] the same [[H259]] size. [[H4060]] 
3 Five [[H2568]] of the curtains [[H3407]] are to be [[H1961]] joined [[H2266]] together, [[H802]] and the other five [[H2568]] curtains [[H3407]] joined [[H2266]] [as well]. [[H802]] 
4 Make [[H6213]] loops [[H3924]] of blue [material] [[H8504]] on [[H5921]] the edge [[H8193]] of the end [[H7098]] curtain [[H3407]] in the first [[H259]] set, [[H2279]] and do [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] for the end [[H7020]] curtain [[H3407]] in the second [[H8145]] set. [[H4225]] 
5 Make [[H6213]] fifty [[H2572]] loops [[H3924]] on the edge [[H7097]] of the [[H259]] end curtain [[H3407]] of both [[H8145]] sets, [[H4225]] so that the loops [[H3924]] line up [[H6901]] opposite [[H802]] one another. [[H269]] 
6 Make [[H6213]] fifty [[H2572]] gold [[H2091]] clasps {as well}, [[H7165]] and join [[H2266]] the curtains [[H3407]] together [[H802]] with the clasps, [[H7165]] so that the tabernacle [[H4908]] will be [[H1961]] a single unit. [[H259]] 
7 You are to make [[H6213]] curtains [[H3407]] of goat hair [[H5795]] for the tent [[H168]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] eleven [[H6249]] curtains altogether. [[H3407]] 
8 Each [[H259]] of the eleven [[H6249]] curtains [[H3407]] [is to be] the same [[H259]] size, [[H4060]] thirty [[H7970]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] [and] four [[H702]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] 
9 Join [[H2266]] five [[H2568]] of the curtains [[H3407]] into one set [[H905]] and the other six [[H8337]] into another. [[H3407]] Then fold the sixth [[H8345]] curtain {over} [[H3407]] double [[H3717]] at [[H413]] the front [[H4136]] of the tent. [[H168]] 
10 Make [[H6213]] fifty [[H2572]] loops [[H3924]] along [[H5921]] the edge [[H8193]] of the [[H259]] end [[H7020]] curtain [[H3407]] in the first set, [[H2279]] and fifty [[H2572]] along [[H5921]] the edge [[H8193]] of the corresponding curtain [[H3407]] in the second [[H8145]] set. [[H2279]] 
11 Make [[H6213]] fifty [[H2572]] bronze [[H5178]] clasps [[H7165]] and put [[H935]] [them] [[H7165]] through the loops [[H3924]] to join [[H2266]] the tent [[H168]] together as [[H1961]] a single unit. [[H259]] 
12 As for the overlap [[H5629]] that remains [[H5736]] of the tent [[H168]] curtains, [[H3407]] the half [[H2677]] curtain [[H3407]] that is left over [[H5736]] shall hang down [[H5628]] over [[H5921]] the back [[H268]] of the tabernacle. [[H4908]] 
13 And the tent [[H168]] curtains [will be] [[H3407]] a cubit [[H520]] longer [[H753]] on either side, [[H2088]] and the excess [[H5736]] will [[H1961]] hang [[H5628]] over [[H5921]] the sides [[H6654]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] to cover it. [[H3680]] 
14 Also make [[H6213]] a covering [[H4372]] for the tent [[H168]] out of ram [[H352]] skins [[H5785]] dyed red, [[H119]] with a covering [[H4372]] of fine leather [[H8476]] over it. [[H4605]] 
15 You are to make [[H6213]] upright [[H5975]] frames [[H7175]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] for the tabernacle. [[H4908]] 
16 Each frame [[H7175]] is to be ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] wide. [[H7341]] 
17 The frames [[H7175]] must each [[H259]] be connected [[H7947]] together [[H802]] with two [[H8147]] tenons. [[H3027]] Do [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] for all [[H3605]] the frames [[H7175]] of the tabernacle. [[H4908]] 
18 Construct [[H6213]] twenty [[H6242]] frames [[H7175]] for the south [[H5045]] side [[H6285]] for the tabernacle, [[H4908]] 
19 with [[H6213]] forty [[H705]] silver [[H3701]] bases [[H134]] under [[H8478]] the twenty [[H6242]] frames— [[H7175]] two [[H8147]] bases [[H134]] under [[H8478]] [each] [[H259]] frame, [[H7175]] one for each [[H8147]] tenon. [[H3027]] 
20 For the second [[H8145]] side [[H6763]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the north [[H6828]] side, [[H6285]] [make] twenty [[H6242]] frames [[H7175]] 
21 and forty [[H705]] silver [[H3701]] bases— [[H134]] two [[H8147]] bases [[H134]] under [[H8478]] each [[H259]] frame. [[H7175]] 
22 For the rear [[H3411]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the west side, [[H3220]] make [[H6213]] six [[H8337]] frames, [[H7175]] 
23 [as well as] [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] frames [[H7175]] for the two back [[H3411]] corners [[H4742]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] 
24 coupled [[H8382]] together [[H3162]] from [[H5921]] bottom [[H4295]] to top [[H7218]] and fitted into [[H413]] a single [[H259]] ring. [[H2885]] These [[H8147]] will serve as [[H1961]] the two [[H8147]] corners. [[H4740]] 
25 So there are to be [[H1961]] eight [[H8083]] frames [[H7175]] and sixteen [[H8337]] silver [[H3701]] bases [for the rear side]— [[H134]] two [[H8147]] bases [[H134]] under [[H8478]] each [[H259]] frame. [[H7175]] 
26 You are to also make [[H6213]] five [[H2568]] crossbars [[H1280]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] for the frames [[H7175]] on one [[H259]] side [[H6763]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] 
27 five [[H2568]] for those [[H7175]] on the other [[H8145]] side, [[H6763]] and five [[H2568]] for those [[H7175]] on the rear [[H3411]] side [[H6763]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] to the west. [[H3220]] 
28 The central [[H8484]] crossbar [[H1280]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the frames [[H7175]] shall extend [[H1272]] from [[H4480]] one end [[H7097]] to the other. [[H413]] 
29 Overlay [[H6823]] the frames [[H7175]] with gold [[H2091]] and make [[H6213]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] to hold [[H1004]] the crossbars. [[H1280]] Also overlay [[H6823]] the crossbars [[H1280]] with gold. [[H2091]] 
30 So you are to set up [[H6965]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] according to the pattern [[H4941]] shown you [[H7200]] on the mountain. [[H2022]] 
31 Make [[H6213]] a veil [[H6532]] of blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] with cherubim [[H3742]] skillfully [[H2803]] worked [[H4639]] into it. [[H6213]] 
32 Hang [[H5414]] it [[H853]] with gold [[H2091]] hooks [[H2053]] on [[H5921]] four [[H702]] gold-plated [[H6823]] posts [[H5982]] of acacia wood [[H7848]] standing on [[H5921]] four [[H702]] silver [[H3701]] bases. [[H134]] 
33 And you are to hang [[H5414]] the veil [[H6532]] from [[H8478]] the clasps [[H7165]] and place [[H935]] the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] behind [[H1004]] the veil. [[H6532]] So the veil [[H6532]] will separate [[H914]] the Holy Place [[H6944]] from the Most Holy Place. [[H6944]] 
34 Put [[H5414]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] on [[H5921]] the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] in the Most Holy Place. [[H6944]] 
35 And place [[H7760]] the table [[H7979]] outside [[H2351]] the veil [[H6532]] on [[H5921]] the north [[H6828]] side [[H6763]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] and [[H853]] put [[H5414]] the lampstand [[H4501]] opposite [[H5227]] [it] [[H7979]] on [[H5921]] the south [[H8486]] side. [[H6763]] 
36 For the entrance [[H6607]] to the tent, [[H168]] you are to make [[H6213]] a curtain [[H4539]] embroidered [[H7551]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]] 
37 Make [[H6213]] five [[H2568]] posts [[H5982]] of acacia wood [[H7848]] for the curtain, [[H4539]] overlay [[H6823]] them [[H853]] with gold [[H2091]] hooks, [[H2053]] and cast [[H3332]] five [[H2568]] bronze [[H5178]] bases [[H134]] for them.
