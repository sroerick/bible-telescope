# Exodus 4
[[Exodus 3|←]] • [[Exodus 5|→]]
1 Then Moses [[H4872]] answered, [[H6030]] “What if [[H2005]] they refuse [[H3808]] to believe [[H539]] me  or [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to my voice? [[H6963]] For [[H3588]] they may say, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] appeared [[H7200]] to you.’” [[H413]] 
2 And the LORD [[H3068]] asked [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “What is that [[H2088]] in your hand?” [[H3027]] “A staff,” [[H4294]] he replied. [[H559]] 
3 “Throw [[H7993]] it on the ground,” [[H776]] said [the Lord]. [[H559]] So [Moses] threw [[H7993]] it on the ground, [[H776]] and it became [[H1961]] a snake, [[H5175]] and [he] [[H4872]] ran [[H5127]] from it. [[H6440]] 
4 “Stretch out [[H7971]] your hand [[H3027]] and grab it [[H270]] by the tail,” [[H2180]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses. [[H4872]] So he reached out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] and caught [[H2388]] [the snake],  and it turned back [[H1961]] into a staff [[H4294]] in his hand. [[H3709]] 
5 “This is so that [[H4616]] they may believe [[H539]] that [[H3588]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers— [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] the God [[H430]] of Isaac, [[H3327]] and the God [[H430]] of Jacob— [[H3290]] has appeared [[H7200]] to you.” [[H413]] 
6 Furthermore, [[H5750]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [Moses],  “Put [[H935]] your hand [[H3027]] inside your cloak.” [[H2436]] So he put [[H935]] his hand [[H3027]] inside his cloak, [[H2436]] and when he took it out, [[H3318]] his hand [[H3027]] [was] leprous, [[H6879]] white as snow. [[H7950]] 
7 “Put your hand [[H3027]] back [[H7725]] inside [[H413]] your cloak,” [[H2436]] said [the LORD]. [[H559]] So [Moses] put his hand [[H3027]] back [[H7725]] inside [[H413]] his cloak, [[H2436]] and when he took it out, [[H3318]] it was restored, [[H7725]] like the rest of his skin. [[H1320]] 
8 [And the LORD said,] [[H1961]] “If [[H518]] they refuse [[H3808]] to believe [[H539]] you  or [[H3808]] heed [[H8085]] the witness [[H6963]] of the first [[H7223]] sign, [[H226]] they may believe [[H539]] [that] [[H6963]] of the second. [[H314]] 
9 But if [[H518]] they do not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] even [[H1571]] these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] signs [[H226]] or listen [[H8085]] to your voice, [[H6963]] take [[H3947]] some water [[H4325]] from the Nile [[H2975]] and pour [[H8210]] it on the dry ground. [[H3004]] Then [[H1961]] the water [[H4325]] you take [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] the Nile [[H2975]] will become [[H1961]] blood [[H1818]] on the ground. [[H3006]] 
10 “Please, [[H994]] Lord,” [[H136]] Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] have never [[H3808]] been eloquent, [[H1697]] neither [[H1571]] in the past [[H8543]] nor [[H1571]] since [[H227]] You have spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Your servant, [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am slow [[H3515]] of speech [[H6310]] and [[H3515]] tongue.” [[H3956]] 
11 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Who [[H4310]] gave [[H7760]] man [[H120]] his mouth? [[H6310]] Or [[H176]] who [[H4310]] makes [[H7760]] him mute [[H483]] or [[H176]] deaf, [[H2795]] sighted [[H6493]] or [[H176]] blind? [[H5787]] Is it not [[H3808]] I, [[H595]] the LORD? [[H3068]] 
12 Now [[H6258]] go! [[H1980]] I [[H595]] will help you [[H1961]] as you speak, [[H6310]] and I will teach [[H3384]] you what [[H834]] to say.” [[H1696]] 
13 But Moses replied, [[H559]] “Please, [[H994]] Lord, [[H136]] send [[H7971]] someone else.” [[H3027]] 
14 Then the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against Moses, [[H4872]] and He said, [[H559]] “Is not [[H3808]] Aaron [[H175]] the Levite [[H3881]] your brother? [[H251]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] can speak [[H1696]] well, [[H1696]] and [[H1571]] he [[H1931]] is now [[H2009]] on his way [[H3318]] to meet you. [[H7125]] When he sees you, [[H7200]] he will be glad [[H8056]] in his heart. [[H3820]] 
15 You are to speak [[H1696]] to him [[H413]] and put [[H7760]] the words [[H1697]] in his mouth. [[H6310]] I [[H595]] will help [[H1961]] both of you to speak, [[H6310]] and I will teach [[H3384]] you what [[H834]] to do. [[H6213]] 
16 He [[H1931]] will speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the people for you. [[H5971]] He [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] your spokesman, [[H6310]] and it will be [[H1961]] as if you were [[H859]] God [[H430]] to him.  
17 But [[H853]] take [[H3947]] this [[H2088]] staff [[H4294]] in your hand [[H3027]] so that [[H834]] you can perform [[H6213]] signs with it.” [[H226]] 
18 Then Moses [[H4872]] went [[H1980]] back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his father-in-law [[H2859]] Jethro [[H3503]] and said to him, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] let me return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] my brothers [[H251]] in Egypt [[H4714]] and see [[H7200]] if they are still [[H5750]] alive.” [[H2416]] “Go [[H1980]] in peace,” [[H7965]] [Jethro] replied. [[H559]] 
19 Now the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] in Midian, [[H4080]] “Go [[H1980]] back [[H7725]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] who sought [[H1245]] to kill you [[H5315]] are dead.” [[H4191]] 
20 So Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] his wife [[H802]] and sons, [[H1121]] put [[H7392]] them on [[H5921]] a donkey, [[H2543]] and headed back [[H7725]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] And [he] [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the staff [[H4294]] of God [[H430]] in his hand. [[H3027]] 
21 The LORD [[H3068]] instructed [[H559]] Moses, [[H4872]] “When you go [[H1980]] back [[H7725]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] see that [[H7200]] you perform [[H6213]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] all [[H3605]] the wonders [[H4159]] that [[H834]] I have put [[H7760]] within your power. [[H3027]] But I [[H589]] will harden [[H2388]] his heart [[H3820]] so that he will not [[H3808]] let the people [[H5971]] go. [[H7971]] 
22 Then tell [[H559]] Pharaoh [that] [[H6547]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Israel [[H3478]] is My firstborn [[H1060]] son, [[H1121]] 
23 and I told you [[H559]] to let My son [[H1121]] go [[H7971]] so that he may worship Me. [[H5647]] But you have refused [[H3985]] to let him go, [[H7971]] so [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will kill [[H2026]] your firstborn [[H1060]] son!’” [[H1121]] 
24 Now at a lodging place [[H4411]] along the way, [[H1870]] the LORD [[H3068]] confronted [Moses] [[H6298]] and was about [[H1245]] to kill him. [[H4191]] 
25 But Zipporah [[H6855]] took [[H3947]] a flint knife, [[H6864]] cut off [[H3772]] her son’s [[H1121]] foreskin, [[H6190]] and touched [[H5060]] [Moses’] feet [with it]. [[H7272]] “Surely [[H3588]] you [are] [[H859]] a bridegroom [[H2860]] of blood to me,” [[H1818]] she said. [[H559]] 
26 So [the LORD] let him alone. [[H7503]] (When [[H227]] she said, [[H559]] “bridegroom [[H2860]] of blood,” [[H1818]] she was referring to the circumcision.) [[H4139]] 
27 Meanwhile, the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] “Go [[H1980]] and meet [[H7125]] Moses [[H4872]] in the wilderness.” [[H4057]] So he went [[H1980]] and met [Moses] [[H6298]] at the mountain [[H2022]] of God [[H430]] and kissed [[H5401]] him.  
28 And Moses [[H4872]] told [[H5046]] Aaron [[H175]] everything [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] had sent [[H7971]] him to say, [[H853]] and all [[H3605]] the signs [[H226]] He had commanded him to perform. [[H6680]] 
29 Then Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went [[H1980]] and assembled [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] 
30 and Aaron [[H175]] relayed [[H1696]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses. [[H4872]] And [Moses] performed [[H6213]] the signs [[H226]] before [[H5869]] the people, [[H5971]] 
31 and [they] [[H5971]] believed. [[H539]] And when they heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had attended [[H6485]] to the Israelites [[H1121]] and [[H3588]] had seen [[H7200]] their affliction, [[H6040]] they bowed down [[H6915]] and worshiped. [[H7812]]
