# Exodus 21
[[Exodus 20|←]] • [[Exodus 22|→]]
1 These [[H428]] are the ordinances [[H4941]] that [[H834]] you are to set [[H7760]] before them: [[H6440]] 
2 If [[H3588]] you buy [[H7069]] a Hebrew [[H5680]] servant, [[H5650]] he is to serve you [[H5647]] for six [[H8337]] years. [[H8141]] But in the seventh [year], [[H7637]] he shall go [[H3318]] free [[H2670]] without paying anything. [[H2600]] 
3 If [[H518]] he arrived alone, [[H935]] he is to leave alone; [[H3318]] if [[H518]] he [[H1931]] arrived with a wife, [[H802]] [she] [[H802]] is to leave [[H3318]] with him. [[H5973]] 
4 If [[H518]] his master [[H113]] gives [[H5414]] him a wife [[H802]] and she bears [[H3205]] him sons [[H1121]] or [[H176]] daughters, [[H1323]] the woman [[H802]] and her children [[H3206]] shall belong to [[H1961]] her master, [[H113]] and [only] the man [[H1931]] shall go free. [[H3318]] 
5 But if [[H518]] the servant [[H5650]] declares, [[H559]] ‘I love [[H157]] my master [[H113]] and my wife [[H802]] and children; [[H1121]] I do not [[H3808]] want to go [[H3318]] free,’ [[H2670]] 
6 then his master [[H113]] is to bring [[H5066]] him before [[H413]] the judges. [[H430]] And he shall take him [[H5066]] to [[H413]] the door [[H1817]] or [[H176]] doorpost [[H4201]] and pierce [[H7527]] his ear [[H241]] with an awl. [[H4836]] Then he shall serve his master [[H5647]] for life. [[H5769]] 
7 And if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] sells [[H4376]] his daughter [[H1323]] as a servant, [[H519]] she is not [[H3808]] to go free [[H3318]] as the menservants do. [[H5650]] 
8 If [[H518]] she is displeasing [[H7451]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of her master [[H113]] who [[H834]] had designated her for himself, [[H3259]] he must allow her to be redeemed. [[H6299]] He has no [[H3808]] right [[H4910]] to sell [[H4376]] her to foreigners, [[H5971]] since he has broken faith [[H898]] with her.  
9 And if [[H518]] he chooses her [[H3259]] for his son, [[H1121]] he must deal [[H6213]] with her as with [[H4941]] a daughter. [[H1323]] 
10 If [[H518]] he takes [[H3947]] another wife, [[H312]] he must not [[H3808]] reduce [[H1639]] the food, [[H7607]] clothing, [[H3682]] or marital rights [of his first wife]. [[H5772]] 
11 If, however, [[H518]] he does not [[H3808]] provide [[H6213]] her  these [[H428]] three things, [[H7969]] she is free to go [[H3318]] without [[H369]] monetary payment. [[H3701]] 
12 Whoever strikes [[H5221]] and kills [[H4191]] a man [[H376]] must surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]] 
13 But if [[H834]] he did not [[H3808]] lie in wait, [[H6658]] but God [[H430]] allowed it to happen, [[H579]] then I will appoint [[H7760]] for you  a place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] he may flee. [[H5127]] 
14 But if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] schemes [[H6195]] and acts willfully [[H2102]] against [[H5921]] his neighbor [[H7453]] to kill him, [[H2026]] you must take him [[H3947]] away from [[H5973]] My altar [[H4196]] to be put to death. [[H4191]] 
15 He who strikes [[H5221]] his father [[H1]] or mother [[H517]] must surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]] 
16 Whoever kidnaps [[H1589]] another man [[H376]] must be put to death, [[H4191]] whether he sells him [[H4376]] or the man is found [[H4672]] in his possession. [[H3027]] 
17 Whoever curses [[H7043]] his father [[H1]] or mother [[H517]] must surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]] 
18 If [[H3588]] men [[H376]] are quarreling [[H7378]] and one [[H376]] strikes [[H5221]] the other [[H7453]] with a stone [[H68]] or [[H176]] a fist, [[H106]] and he does not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] but is confined [[H5307]] to bed, [[H4904]] 
19 then the one who struck him [[H5221]] shall go unpunished, [[H5352]] as long as [[H518]] the other can get up [[H6965]] and walk around [[H1980]] outside [[H2351]] with [[H5921]] his staff. [[H4938]] Nevertheless, [[H7535]] he must compensate [[H5414]] the man for his lost work [[H7674]] and see that he is completely [[H7495]] healed. [[H7495]] 
20 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] strikes [[H5221]] his male [[H5650]] or [[H176]] female servant [[H519]] with a rod, [[H7626]] and the servant dies [[H4191]] by [[H8478]] his hand, [[H3027]] he shall surely [[H5358]] be punished. [[H5358]] 
21 However, [[H389]] if [[H518]] the slave gets up [[H5975]] after a day [[H3117]] or [[H176]] two, [[H3117]] the owner shall not [[H3808]] be punished, [[H5358]] since [[H3588]] [the slave is] [[H1931]] his property. [[H3701]] 
22 If [[H3588]] men [[H582]] who are fighting [[H5327]] strike [[H5062]] a pregnant [[H2030]] woman [[H802]] and her child [[H3206]] is born prematurely, [[H3318]] but there is [[H1961]] no [further] [[H3808]] injury, [[H611]] he shall surely be fined [[H6064]] as [[H834]] the woman’s [[H802]] husband [[H1167]] demands [[H7896]] and as the court allows. [[H5414]] 
23 But if [[H518]] a serious injury [[H611]] results, [[H1961]] then you must require [[H5414]] a life [[H5315]] for [[H8478]] a life— [[H5315]] 
24 eye [[H5869]] for [[H8478]] eye, [[H5869]] tooth [[H8127]] for [[H8478]] tooth, [[H8127]] hand [[H3027]] for [[H8478]] hand, [[H3027]] foot [[H7272]] for [[H8478]] foot, [[H7272]] 
25 burn [[H3555]] for [[H8478]] burn, [[H3555]] wound [[H6482]] for [[H8478]] wound, [[H6482]] [and] stripe [[H2250]] for [[H8478]] stripe. [[H2250]] 
26 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] strikes [[H5221]] the eye [[H5869]] of his manservant [[H5650]] or [[H176]] maidservant [[H519]] and blinds it, [[H7843]] he must let the servant go [[H7971]] free [[H2670]] in compensation for [[H8478]] the eye. [[H5869]] 
27 And if [[H518]] he knocks out [[H5307]] the tooth [[H8127]] of his manservant [[H5650]] or [[H176]] maidservant, [[H519]] he must let the servant go [[H7971]] free [[H2670]] in compensation for [[H8478]] the tooth. [[H8127]] 
28 If [[H3588]] an ox [[H7794]] gores [[H5055]] a man [[H376]] or [[H176]] woman [[H802]] to death, [[H4191]] the ox [[H7794]] must surely [[H5619]] be stoned, [[H5619]] and its meat [[H1320]] must not [[H3808]] be eaten. [[H398]] But the owner [[H1167]] of the ox [[H7794]] shall not be held responsible. [[H5355]] 
29 But if [[H518]] the ox [[H7794]] has a reputation [[H8543]] for goring, [[H5056]] and its owner [[H1167]] has been warned [[H5749]] yet does not [[H3808]] restrain it, [[H8104]] and it kills [[H4191]] a man [[H376]] or [[H176]] woman, [[H802]] them the ox [[H7794]] must be stoned [[H5619]] and its owner [[H1167]] must also [[H1571]] be put to death. [[H4191]] 
30 If [[H518]] payment [[H3724]] is demanded [[H7896]] of him {instead}, [[H5921]] he may redeem [[H6306]] his life [[H5315]] by paying [[H5414]] the full [[H3605]] amount demanded [[H7896]] of him. [[H5921]] 
31 If [[H176]] [the ox] gores [[H5055]] a son [[H1121]] or [[H176]] a daughter, [[H1323]] it shall be done [[H6213]] to him  according to the same [[H2088]] rule. [[H4941]] 
32 If [[H518]] the ox [[H7794]] gores [[H5055]] a manservant [[H5650]] or [[H176]] maidservant, [[H519]] [the owner] must pay [[H5414]] thirty [[H7970]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver [[H3701]] to the master of that servant, [[H113]] and the ox [[H7794]] must be stoned. [[H5619]] 
33 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] opens [[H6605]] or [[H176]] digs [[H3738]] a pit [[H953]] and fails [[H3808]] to cover it, [[H3680]] and an ox [[H7794]] or [[H176]] a donkey [[H2543]] falls [[H5307]] into it, [[H8033]] 
34 the owner [[H1167]] of the pit [[H953]] shall make restitution; [[H7999]] he must pay [[H7725]] its owner, [[H1167]] and the dead [animal] [[H4191]] will be [[H1961]] his.  
35 If [[H3588]] a man’s [[H376]] ox [[H7794]] injures [[H5062]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] ox [[H7794]] and it dies, [[H4191]] they must sell [[H4376]] the live [[H2416]] [one] [[H7794]] and divide [[H2673]] the proceeds; [[H3701]] they also must [[H1571]] divide [[H2673]] the dead animal. [[H4191]] 
36 But if [[H176]] it was known [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the ox [[H7794]] had a habit [[H8543]] of goring, [[H5056]] yet its owner [[H1167]] failed [[H3808]] to restrain it, [[H8104]] he shall pay full compensation, [[H7999]] ox [[H7794]] for [[H8478]] ox, [[H7794]] and the dead [animal] [[H4191]] will be [[H1961]] his.
