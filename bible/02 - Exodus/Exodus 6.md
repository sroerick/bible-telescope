# Exodus 6
[[Exodus 5|←]] • [[Exodus 7|→]]
1 But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Now [[H6258]] you will see [[H7200]] what [[H834]] I will do [[H6213]] to Pharaoh, [[H6547]] for [[H3588]] because of My mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] he will let them go; [[H7971]] because of My strong [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] he will drive them out of [[H1644]] his land.” [[H776]] 
2 God also [[H430]] told [[H1696]] Moses, [[H4872]] “I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 I appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] to [[H413]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and to [[H413]] Jacob [[H3290]] as God [[H410]] Almighty, [[H7706]] but I did not [[H3808]] reveal Myself [[H3045]] to them  by My name, [[H8034]] ‘the LORD.’ [[H3068]] 
4 I also [[H1571]] established [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] them to give [[H5414]] them the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] the land where [[H776]] they lived as foreigners. [[H1481]] 
5 Furthermore, [[H1571]] I [[H589]] have heard [[H8085]] the groaning [[H5009]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] are enslaving, [[H5647]] and I have remembered [[H2142]] My covenant. [[H1285]] 
6 Therefore [[H3651]] tell [[H559]] the Israelites: [[H1121]] ‘I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] and I will bring [[H3318]] you [[H853]] out from under [[H8478]] the yoke [[H5450]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] and deliver [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from their bondage. [[H5656]] I will redeem [[H1350]] you [[H853]] with an outstretched [[H5186]] arm [[H2220]] and with mighty [[H1419]] acts of judgment. [[H8201]] 
7 I will take [[H3947]] you [[H853]] as My own  people, [[H5971]] and I will be [[H1961]] your  God. [[H430]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who brought [[H3318]] you [[H853]] out from under [[H8478]] the yoke [[H5450]] of the Egyptians. [[H4714]] 
8 And I will bring [[H935]] you [[H853]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I swore [[H5375]] to give [[H5414]] to Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob. [[H3290]] I will give [[H5414]] it [[H853]] to you  as a possession. [[H4181]] I [[H589]] am the LORD!’” [[H3068]] 
9 Moses [[H4872]] relayed [[H1696]] this [message] [[H3651]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] but on account of their broken spirit [[H7115]] and cruel [[H7186]] bondage, [[H5656]] they did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] [him]. [[H4872]] 
10 So the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
11 “Go [[H935]] and tell [[H1696]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to let the Israelites [[H1121]] go out [[H7971]] of his land.” [[H776]] 
12 But in the LORD’s [[H3068]] presence [[H6440]] Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H1696]] “If [[H2005]] the Israelites [[H1121]] will not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to me, [[H413]] then how [[H349]] will Pharaoh [[H6547]] listen to me, [[H8085]] since I [[H589]] am unskilled [[H6189]] in speech?” [[H8193]] 
13 Then the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] and gave them a charge [[H6680]] concerning [[H413]] both the Israelites [[H1121]] and Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] to bring [[H3318]] the Israelites [[H1121]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
14 These [[H428]] were the heads [[H7218]] of their fathers’ [[H1]] houses: [[H1004]] The sons [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Israel, [were] [[H3478]] Hanoch [[H2585]] and Pallu, [[H6396]] Hezron [[H2696]] and Carmi. [[H3756]] These [[H428]] were the clans [[H4940]] of Reuben. [[H7205]] 
15 The sons [[H1121]] of Simeon [were] [[H8095]] Jemuel, [[H3223]] Jamin, [[H3226]] Ohad, [[H161]] Jachin, [[H3199]] Zohar, [[H6714]] and Shaul, [[H7586]] the son [[H1121]] of a Canaanite woman. [[H3669]] These [[H428]] were the clans [[H4940]] of Simeon. [[H8095]] 
16 These [[H428]] were the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3878]] according to their records: [[H8435]] Gershon, [[H1648]] Kohath, [[H6955]] and Merari. [[H4847]] Levi [[H3878]] lived [[H2416]] 137 [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]] 
17 The sons [[H1121]] of Gershon [were] [[H1648]] Libni [[H3845]] and Shimei, [[H8096]] by their clans. [[H4940]] 
18 The sons [[H1121]] of Kohath [were] [[H6955]] Amram, [[H6019]] Izhar, [[H3324]] Hebron, [[H2275]] and Uzziel. [[H5816]] Kohath [[H6955]] lived [[H2416]] 133 [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]] 
19 The sons [[H1121]] of Merari [were] [[H4847]] Mahli [[H4249]] and Mushi. [[H4187]] These [[H428]] were the clans [[H4940]] of the Levites [[H3878]] according to their records. [[H8435]] 
20 And Amram [[H6019]] married [[H3947]] his father’s sister [[H1733]] Jochebed, [[H3115]] and she bore [[H3205]] him Aaron [[H175]] and Moses. [[H4872]] Amram [[H6019]] lived [[H2416]] 137 [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]] 
21 The sons [[H1121]] of Izhar [were] [[H3324]] Korah, [[H7141]] Nepheg, [[H5298]] and Zichri. [[H2147]] 
22 The sons [[H1121]] of Uzziel [were] [[H5816]] Mishael, [[H4332]] Elzaphan, [[H469]] and Sithri. [[H5644]] 
23 And Aaron [[H175]] married [[H3947]] Elisheba, [[H472]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Amminadab [[H5992]] and sister [[H269]] of Nahshon. [[H5177]] She bore [[H3205]] him Nadab [[H5070]] and Abihu, [[H30]] Eleazar [[H499]] and Ithamar. [[H385]] 
24 The sons [[H1121]] of Korah [were] [[H7141]] Assir, [[H617]] Elkanah, [[H511]] and Abiasaph. [[H23]] These [[H428]] were the clans [[H4940]] of the Korahites. [[H7145]] 
25 Aaron’s [[H175]] son [[H1121]] Eleazar [[H499]] married [[H3947]] [one] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Putiel, [[H6317]] and she bore [[H3205]] him  Phinehas. [[H6372]] These [[H428]] were the heads [[H7218]] of the Levite [[H3881]] families [[H1]] by their clans. [[H4940]] 
26 It was this [[H1931]] Aaron [[H175]] and Moses [[H4872]] to whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “Bring the Israelites [[H1121]] out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] by [[H5921]] their divisions.” [[H6635]] 
27 Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] were the ones who spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] in order to bring the Israelites [[H1121]] out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
28 Now [[H1961]] on the day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] 
29 He [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] him, [[H4872]] “I [[H589]] am the LORD; [[H3068]] tell [[H1696]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] say [[H1696]] to you.” [[H413]] 
30 But in the LORD’s [[H3068]] presence [[H6440]] Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H559]] “Since [[H2005]] I [[H589]] am unskilled [[H6189]] in speech, [[H8193]] why [[H349]] would Pharaoh [[H6547]] listen [[H8085]] to me?” [[H413]]
