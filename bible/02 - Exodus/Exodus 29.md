[[Exodus 28|←]] • [[Exodus 30|→]]
1 Now this [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] you are to do [[H6213]] to consecrate [[H6942]] them [[H853]] to serve Me as priests: [[H3547]] Take [[H3947]] a [[H259]] young [[H1121]] bull [[H6499]] and two [[H8147]] rams [[H352]] without blemish, [[H8549]] 
2 along with unleavened [[H4682]] bread, [[H3899]] unleavened [[H4682]] cakes [[H2471]] mixed [[H1101]] with oil, [[H8081]] and unleavened [[H4682]] wafers [[H7550]] anointed [[H4886]] with oil. [[H8081]] Make [[H6213]] them out of fine wheat [[H2406]] flour, [[H5560]] 
3 put [[H5414]] them in [[H5921]] a [[H259]] basket, [[H5536]] and present [[H7126]] them [[H853]] in the basket, [[H5536]] along with the bull [[H6499]] and the two [[H8147]] rams. [[H352]] 
4 Then [[H853]] bring [[H7126]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and wash [[H7364]] them with water. [[H4325]] 
5 Take [[H3947]] the garments [[H899]] and clothe [[H3847]] Aaron [[H175]] with the tunic, [[H3801]] the robe [[H4598]] of the ephod, [[H646]] the ephod itself, [[H646]] and the breastplate. [[H2833]] Fasten [[H640]] the ephod [[H646]] on him  with its woven waistband. [[H2805]] 
6 Put [[H7760]] the turban [[H4701]] on [[H5921]] his head [[H7218]] and attach [[H5414]] the holy [[H6944]] diadem [[H5145]] to [[H5921]] the turban. [[H4701]] 
7 Then take [[H3947]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and anoint him [[H4886]] by pouring [[H3332]] it on [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]] 
8 Bring [[H7126]] his sons {as well} [[H1121]] and clothe [[H3847]] them with tunics. [[H3801]] 
9 Wrap [[H2296]] the sashes [[H73]] around Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] and put [[H2280]] headbands [[H4021]] on them. [[H1992]] The priesthood [[H3550]] shall be [[H1961]] theirs [[H1992]] by a perpetual [[H5769]] statute. [[H2708]] In this way you are to ordain [[H4390]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons. [[H1121]] 
10 Bring [[H7126]] the bull [[H6499]] to the front [[H6440]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] are to lay [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] [its] [[H6499]] head. [[H7218]] 
11 And you shall slaughter [[H7819]] the bull [[H6499]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
12 Take some [[H3947]] of the blood [[H1818]] of the bull [[H6499]] and put [[H5414]] [it] on [[H5921]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar [[H4196]] with your finger; [[H676]] then pour out [[H8210]] the rest [[H3605]] of the blood [[H1818]] at [[H413]] the base [[H3247]] of the altar. [[H4196]] 
13 Take [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] that covers [[H3680]] the entrails [[H7130]] and [[H853]] the lobe [[H3508]] of [[H5921]] the liver, [[H3516]] and both [[H8147]] kidneys [[H3629]] with the fat [[H2459]] on them, [[H5921]] and burn [[H6999]] them on the altar. [[H4196]] 
14 But burn [[H8313]] the flesh [[H1320]] of the bull [[H6499]] and [[H853]] its hide [[H5785]] and dung [[H6569]] outside [[H2351]] the camp; [[H4264]] it [is] [[H1931]] a sin offering. [[H2403]] 
15 Take [[H3947]] one [[H259]] of the rams, [[H352]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] shall lay [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] [its] [[H352]] head. [[H7218]] 
16 You are to slaughter [[H7819]] the ram, [[H352]] take [[H3947]] its blood, [[H1818]] and sprinkle [[H2236]] it on [[H5921]] all sides [[H5439]] of the altar. [[H4196]] 
17 Cut [[H5408]] the ram [[H352]] into pieces, [[H5409]] wash [[H7364]] the entrails [[H7130]] and legs, [[H3767]] and place [[H5414]] them with [[H5921]] its head [[H7218]] and other pieces. [[H5409]] 
18 Then burn [[H6999]] the entire [[H3605]] ram [[H352]] on the altar; [[H4196]] it [[H1931]] is a burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma, [[H7381]] an offering made to the LORD by fire. [[H801]] 
19 Take [[H3947]] the second [[H8145]] ram, [[H352]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] are to lay [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] [its] [[H352]] head. [[H7218]] 
20 Slaughter [[H7819]] the ram, [[H352]] take [[H3947]] some of its blood, [[H1818]] and put [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] the right earlobes [[H8571]] of Aaron [[H175]] and [[H5921]] his sons, [[H1121]] on [[H5921]] the thumbs [[H931]] of their right [[H3233]] hands, [[H3027]] and on [[H5921]] the big toes [[H931]] of their right [[H3233]] feet. [[H7272]] Sprinkle [[H2236]] the remaining blood [[H1818]] on [[H5921]] all sides [[H5439]] of the altar. [[H4196]] 
21 And take [[H3947]] some of [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] and some of the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and sprinkle [[H5137]] [it] on [[H5921]] Aaron [[H175]] and his garments, [[H899]] as well as on [[H5921]] his sons [[H1121]] and their garments. [[H899]] Then he [[H1931]] and his garments [[H899]] will be consecrated, [[H6942]] as well as his sons [[H1121]] and their [[H1121]] garments. [[H899]] 
22 Take [[H3947]] the fat [[H2459]] from [[H4480]] the ram, [[H352]] the fat tail, [[H451]] the fat [[H2459]] covering [[H3680]] the entrails, [[H7130]] the lobe [[H3508]] of the liver, [[H3516]] both [[H8147]] kidneys [[H3629]] and the fat [[H2459]] on them, [[H5921]] and the right [[H3225]] thigh [[H7785]] (since [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] is a ram [[H352]] for ordination), [[H4394]] 
23 along with one [[H259]] loaf [[H3603]] of bread, [[H3899]] one [[H259]] cake [[H2471]] of bread [[H3899]] made with oil, [[H8081]] and one [[H259]] wafer [[H7550]] from the basket [[H5536]] of unleavened bread [[H4682]] that [[H834]] is before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
24 Put [[H7760]] all these [[H3605]] into [[H5921]] the hands [[H3709]] of Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] and wave [[H5130]] them [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] as a wave offering. [[H8573]] 
25 Then take [[H3947]] them [[H853]] from their hands [[H3027]] and burn [[H6999]] them on the altar [[H4196]] atop [[H5921]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] before [[H6440]] the LORD; [[H3068]] it [[H1931]] is an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
26 Take [[H3947]] the breast [[H2373]] of the ram [[H352]] of Aaron’s [[H175]] ordination [[H4394]] and wave [[H5130]] it [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] as a wave offering, [[H8573]] and it will be [[H1961]] your  portion. [[H4490]] 
27 Consecrate [[H6942]] for Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] the breast [[H2373]] of the wave offering [[H8573]] that [[H834]] is waved [[H5130]] and the thigh [[H7785]] of the heave offering [[H8641]] that [[H834]] is lifted up [[H7311]] from the ram [[H352]] of ordination. [[H4394]] 
28 This will belong to [[H1961]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] as a regular [[H5769]] portion [[H2706]] from the Israelites, [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is the heave offering [[H8641]] the Israelites [[H1121]] will make [[H8641]] to the LORD [[H3068]] from their peace offerings. [[H8002]] 
29 The holy [[H6944]] garments [[H899]] that [[H834]] belong to Aaron [[H175]] will belong [[H1961]] to his sons [[H1121]] after him, [[H310]] so they can be anointed [[H4888]] and ordained [[H4390]] in them. [[H3027]] 
30 The son [[H1121]] who [[H834]] succeeds him [[H8478]] as priest [[H3548]] and enters [[H935]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] to minister [[H8334]] in the Holy [Place] [[H6944]] must wear [[H3847]] them for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
31 You are to take [[H3947]] the ram [[H352]] of ordination [[H4394]] and boil [[H1310]] its flesh [[H1320]] in a holy [[H6918]] place. [[H4725]] 
32 At the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] are to eat [[H398]] the meat [[H1320]] of the ram [[H352]] and the bread [[H3899]] that [is] [[H834]] in the basket. [[H5536]] 
33 They must eat [[H398]] those things by which [[H834]] atonement was made [[H3722]] for their ordination [[H4390]] and consecration. [[H6942]] But no [[H3808]] outsider [[H2114]] may eat them, [[H398]] because [[H3588]] these [[H1992]] things are sacred. [[H6944]] 
34 And if [[H518]] any of [[H4480]] the meat [[H1320]] of ordination [[H4394]] or any bread [[H3899]] is left [[H3498]] until [[H5704]] the morning, [[H1242]] burn up [[H8313]] the remainder. [[H3498]] It must not [[H3808]] be eaten, [[H398]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is sacred. [[H6944]] 
35 This is what [[H3602]] you are to do [[H6213]] for Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] based on all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] you, [[H853]] taking seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] to ordain [[H4390]] them. [[H3027]] 
36 Sacrifice [[H6213]] a bull [[H6499]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] each day [[H3117]] for [[H5921]] atonement. [[H3722]] Purify [[H2398]] the altar [[H4196]] by making atonement [[H3722]] for it, [[H5921]] and anoint [[H4886]] it [[H853]] to consecrate it. [[H6942]] 
37 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] you shall make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] and consecrate [[H6942]] it. [[H853]] Then the altar [[H4196]] will become [[H1961]] most holy; [[H6944]] whatever [[H3605]] touches [[H5060]] the altar [[H4196]] will be holy. [[H6942]] 
38 This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] you are to offer [[H6213]] regularly [[H8548]] on [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] each day: [[H3117]] two [[H8147]] lambs [[H3532]] [that are] a year old. [[H1121]] 
39 In the morning [[H1242]] offer [[H6213]] one [[H259]] lamb, [[H3532]] and at [[H996]] twilight [[H6153]] offer [[H6213]] the other. [[H8145]] 
40 With the first [[H259]] lamb [[H3532]] [offer] a tenth [of an ephah] [[H6241]] of fine flour, [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with a quarter [[H7253]] hin [[H1969]] of oil [[H8081]] from pressed [olives], [[H3795]] and a drink offering [[H5262]] of a quarter [[H7253]] hin [[H1969]] of wine. [[H3196]] 
41 And [[H853]] you shall offer [[H6213]] the second [[H8145]] lamb [[H3532]] at [[H996]] twilight [[H6153]] with [[H6213]] the same  grain offering [[H4503]] and drink offering [[H5262]] as in the morning, [[H1242]] as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma, [[H7381]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
42 For the generations to come, [[H1755]] this burnt offering [[H5930]] shall be made regularly [[H8548]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] where [[H834]] I will meet [[H3259]] you to speak [[H1696]] with you. [[H413]] 
43 I will also meet [[H3259]] with the Israelites [[H1121]] there, [[H8033]] and that place will be consecrated [[H6942]] by My glory. [[H3519]] 
44 So I will consecrate [[H6942]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and the altar, [[H4196]] and I will consecrate [[H6942]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] to serve Me as priests. [[H3547]] 
45 Then I will dwell [[H7931]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and be [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]] 
46 And they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought them out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] so that I might dwell [[H7931]] among them. [[H8432]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]]
