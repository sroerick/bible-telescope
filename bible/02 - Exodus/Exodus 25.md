# Exodus 25
[[Exodus 24|←]] • [[Exodus 26|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Tell [[H1696]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to bring [[H3947]] Me  an offering. [[H8641]] You are to receive [[H3947]] My offering [[H8641]] from every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] whose [[H834]] heart [[H3820]] compels him. [[H5068]] 
3 This [[H2063]] is the offering [[H8641]] you are to accept [[H3947]] from them: [[H853]] gold, [[H2091]] silver, [[H3701]] and bronze; [[H5178]] 
4 blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn; [[H8438]] fine linen [[H8336]] and goat hair; [[H5795]] 
5 ram [[H352]] skins [[H5785]] dyed red [[H119]] and fine leather; [[H8476]] acacia [[H7848]] wood; [[H6086]] 
6 oil [[H8081]] for lighting; [[H3974]] spices [[H1314]] for the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and for the fragrant [[H5561]] incense; [[H7004]] 
7 and onyx [[H68]] and other gemstones [[H68]] to be mounted [[H4394]] on the ephod [[H646]] and breastpiece. [[H2833]] 
8 And they are to make [[H6213]] a sanctuary [[H4720]] for Me,  so that I may dwell [[H7931]] among them. [[H8432]] 
9 You must make [[H6213]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and [[H853]] design [[H8403]] all [[H3605]] its furnishings [[H3627]] according to [[H3605]] the pattern [[H8403]] I [[H589]] will show [[H7200]] you. [[H853]] 
10 And they are to construct [[H6213]] an ark [[H727]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood, [[H6086]] two [[H520]] and a half cubits [[H2677]] long, [[H753]] a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] wide, [[H7341]] and a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] high. [[H6967]] 
11 Overlay [[H6823]] it with pure [[H2889]] gold [[H2091]] both inside [[H1004]] and out, [[H2351]] and make [[H6213]] a gold [[H2091]] molding [[H2213]] around it. [[H5439]] 
12 Cast [[H3332]] four [[H702]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] for it  and fasten them [[H5414]] to [[H5921]] its four [[H702]] feet, [[H6471]] two [[H8147]] rings [[H2885]] on [[H5921]] one [[H259]] side [[H6763]] and two [[H8147]] on [[H5921]] the other. [[H8145]] 
13 And make [[H6213]] poles [[H905]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] and overlay [[H6823]] them with gold. [[H2091]] 
14 Insert [[H935]] the poles [[H905]] into the rings [[H2885]] on [[H5921]] the sides [[H6763]] of the ark, [[H727]] in order to carry [[H5375]] the ark. [[H727]] 
15 The poles [[H905]] are to remain [[H1961]] in the rings [[H2885]] of the ark; [[H727]] they must not [[H3808]] be removed. [[H5493]] 
16 And put [[H5414]] into [[H413]] the ark [[H727]] the Testimony, [[H5715]] which [[H834]] I will give [[H5414]] you. [[H413]] 
17 And you are to make [[H6213]] a mercy seat [[H3727]] of pure [[H2889]] gold, [[H2091]] two [[H520]] and a half cubits [[H2677]] long [[H753]] and a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] wide. [[H7341]] 
18 And make [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] cherubim [[H3742]] of hammered [[H4749]] gold [[H2091]] at the two [[H8147]] ends [[H7098]] of the mercy seat. [[H3727]] 
19 Mold [[H6213]] one [[H259]] cherub [[H3742]] at [[H4480]] one [[H2088]] end [[H7098]] and a second [[H259]] cherub [[H3742]] at the other [[H2088]] end; [[H7098]] make [[H6213]] the cherubim [[H3742]] [of one piece] with the mercy seat. [[H3727]] 
20 The cherubim [[H3742]] are to have [[H1961]] wings [[H3671]] spread [[H6566]] upward, [[H4605]] overshadowing [[H5526]] the mercy seat, [[H3727]] and they are to face [[H6440]] one [[H376]] another. [[H251]] The faces [[H6440]] of the cherubim [[H3742]] should look [[H1961]] toward [[H413]] the mercy seat. [[H3727]] 
21 Set [[H5414]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] atop [[H5921]] the ark, [[H727]] and put [[H5414]] the Testimony [[H5715]] that [[H834]] I will give [[H5414]] you [[H413]] into [[H413]] the ark. [[H727]] 
22 And I will meet [[H3259]] with you  there [[H8033]] above [[H5921]] the mercy seat, [[H3727]] between [[H996]] the two [[H8147]] cherubim [[H3742]] that [[H834]] are over [[H5921]] the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony; [[H5715]] I will commune [[H1696]] with you [[H853]] about all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I command [[H6680]] you regarding [[H413]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
23 You are also to make [[H6213]] a table [[H7979]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood, [[H6086]] two cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] one cubit [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] high. [[H6967]] 
24 Overlay [[H6823]] it [[H853]] with pure [[H2889]] gold [[H2091]] and construct [[H6213]] a gold [[H2091]] border [[H2213]] around it. [[H5439]] 
25 Also make [[H6213]] a rim [[H4526]] around it [[H5439]] a handbreadth in width, [[H2948]] and put [[H6213]] a gold [[H2091]] molding [[H2213]] on [[H5439]] the rim. [[H4526]] 
26 Make [[H6213]] four [[H702]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] for [the table]  and attach [[H5414]] the rings [[H2885]] to [[H5921]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H6285]] at its four [[H702]] legs. [[H7272]] 
27 The rings [[H2885]] are to be [[H1961]] close [[H5980]] to the rim, [[H4526]] to serve as holders [[H1004]] for the poles [[H905]] to carry [[H5375]] the table. [[H7979]] 
28 Make [[H6213]] the poles [[H905]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] and overlay [[H6823]] them with gold, [[H2091]] so that the table [[H7979]] may be carried [[H5375]] with them. [[H853]] 
29 You are also to make [[H6213]] the plates [[H7086]] and dishes, [[H3709]] as well as the pitchers [[H7184]] and bowls [[H4518]] for pouring drink offerings. [[H5258]] Make [[H6213]] them out of pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]] 
30 And place [[H5414]] the Bread [[H3899]] of the Presence [[H6440]] on [[H5921]] the table [[H7979]] before Me [[H6440]] at all times. [[H8548]] 
31 Then you are to make [[H6213]] a lampstand [[H4501]] of pure, [[H2889]] hammered [[H4749]] gold. [[H2091]] It [[H4501]] shall be made [[H6213]] of one piece, [[H4480]] including [[H1961]] its base [[H3409]] and shaft, [[H7070]] its cups, [[H1375]] and its buds [[H3730]] and petals. [[H6525]] 
32 Six [[H8337]] branches [[H7070]] are to extend [[H3318]] from the sides [[H6654]] of the lampstand— [[H4501]] three [[H7969]] from one [[H259]] side [[H6654]] and three [[H7969]] from the other. [[H8145]] 
33 There are to be three [[H7969]] cups [[H1375]] shaped like almond blossoms [[H8246]] with buds [[H3730]] and petals [[H6525]] on one [[H259]] branch, [[H7070]] three [[H7969]] on the next [[H259]] branch, [[H7070]] and the same [[H3651]] for all six [[H8337]] branches [[H7070]] that extend [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the lampstand. [[H4501]] 
34 And on the lampstand [[H4501]] there shall be four [[H702]] cups [[H1375]] shaped like almond blossoms [[H8246]] with buds [[H3730]] and petals. [[H6525]] 
35 For the six [[H8337]] branches [[H7070]] that extend [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the lampstand, [[H4501]] a bud [[H3730]] must be under [[H8478]] the first pair [[H8147]] of branches, [[H7070]] a bud [[H3730]] under [[H8478]] the second pair, [[H8147]] and a bud [[H3730]] under [[H8478]] the third pair. [[H8147]] 
36 Their buds [[H3730]] and branches [[H7070]] are to be [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] of one piece, [[H259]] hammered [[H4749]] out of [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]] 
37 Make [[H6213]] seven [[H7651]] lamps [[H5216]] and set them up [[H5927]] on [the lampstand] [[H853]] so that [they] [[H5216]] illuminate [[H215]] the area [[H5676]] in [[H5921]] front of it. [[H6440]] 
38 The wick trimmers [[H4457]] and their trays [[H4289]] must be of pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]] 
39 [The lampstand] [[H853]] and all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] utensils [[H3627]] shall be made [[H6213]] from [[H854]] a talent [[H3603]] of pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]] 
40 See that [[H7200]] you make [everything] [[H6213]] according to the pattern [[H8403]] shown [[H7200]] you [[H859]] on the mountain. [[H2022]]
