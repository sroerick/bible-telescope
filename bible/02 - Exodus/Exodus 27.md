# Exodus 27
[[Exodus 26|←]] • [[Exodus 28|→]]
1 You are to build [[H6213]] an altar [[H4196]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood. [[H6086]] The altar [[H4196]] must be [[H1961]] square, [[H7251]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]] 
2 Make [[H6213]] a horn [[H7161]] on each of [[H5921]] its four [[H702]] corners, [[H6438]] so that the horns [[H7161]] are [[H1961]] of one piece, [[H4480]] and overlay [[H6823]] it with bronze. [[H5178]] 
3 Make [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] its utensils [[H3627]] of bronze— [[H5178]] the pots [[H5518]] for removing ashes, [[H1878]] and the shovels, [[H3257]] basins, [[H4219]] meat forks, [[H4207]] and firepans. [[H4289]] 
4 Construct [[H6213]] for it  a grate [[H4345]] of bronze [[H5178]] mesh, [[H7568]] and make a [[H6213]] bronze [[H5178]] ring [[H2885]] at [[H5921]] each of the four [[H702]] corners [[H7098]] of [[H5921]] the mesh. [[H7568]] 
5 Set [[H5414]] [the grate] [[H853]] beneath [[H4295]] the ledge [[H3749]] of the altar, [[H4196]] so that the mesh [[H7568]] comes [[H1961]] halfway [[H2677]] up [[H5704]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
6 Additionally, make [[H6213]] poles [[H905]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] for the altar [[H4196]] and overlay [[H6823]] them with bronze. [[H5178]] 
7 The poles [[H905]] are to be inserted [[H935]] into the rings [[H2885]] so that the poles [[H905]] are [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] sides [[H6763]] of the altar [[H4196]] when it is carried. [[H5375]] 
8 Construct [[H6213]] the altar [[H853]] with boards [[H3871]] so that it is hollow. [[H5014]] It is to be made [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] you were shown [[H7200]] on the mountain. [[H2022]] 
9 You are also to make [[H6213]] a courtyard [[H2691]] for the tabernacle. [[H4908]] On the south side [[H5045]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] make curtains [[H7050]] of finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] on one [[H259]] side, [[H6285]] 
10 with twenty [[H6242]] posts [[H5982]] and twenty [[H6242]] bronze [[H5178]] bases, [[H134]] and silver [[H3701]] hooks [[H2053]] and bands [[H2838]] on the posts. [[H5982]] 
11 Likewise [[H3651]] [there are to be] curtains [[H7050]] on the north [[H6828]] side, [[H6285]] a hundred [[H3967]] [cubits] [[H753]] long, [[H753]] with twenty [[H6242]] posts [[H5982]] and twenty [[H6242]] bronze [[H5178]] bases, [[H134]] and with silver [[H3701]] hooks [[H2053]] and bands [[H2838]] on the posts. [[H5982]] 
12 The curtains [[H7050]] on the west [[H3220]] side [[H6285]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] shall be fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] with ten [[H6235]] posts [[H5982]] and ten [[H6235]] bases. [[H134]] 
13 The east [[H6924]] side [[H6285]] of the courtyard, [[H2691]] toward the sunrise, [[H4217]] [is to be] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] 
14 Make the curtains [[H7050]] on one side [[H3802]] fifteen [[H2568]] cubits long, [[H520]] with three [[H7969]] posts [[H5982]] and three [[H7969]] bases, [[H134]] 
15 and the curtains [[H7050]] on the other [[H8145]] side [[H3802]] fifteen cubits long, [[H2568]] with three [[H7969]] posts [[H5982]] and three [[H7969]] bases. [[H134]] 
16 The gate [[H8179]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] shall be twenty [[H6242]] cubits [long], [[H520]] with a curtain [[H4539]] embroidered [[H7551]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]] It shall have four [[H702]] posts [[H5982]] and four [[H702]] bases. [[H134]] 
17 All [[H3605]] the posts [[H5982]] around [[H5439]] the courtyard [[H2691]] shall have silver bands, [[H2836]] silver [[H3701]] hooks, [[H2053]] and bronze [[H5178]] bases. [[H134]] 
18 The entire [[H2572]] courtyard [[H2691]] [shall be] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and fifty [cubits] [[H2572]] wide, [[H7341]] [with curtains] of finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H6967]] and with bronze [[H5178]] bases. [[H134]] 
19 All [[H3605]] the utensils [[H3627]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] for every [[H3605]] use, [[H5656]] including all [[H3605]] its tent pegs [[H3489]] and [[H3605]] the tent pegs [[H3489]] of the courtyard, [[H2691]] shall be made of bronze. [[H5178]] 
20 And you [[H859]] are to command [[H6680]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to bring [[H3947]] you pure [[H2134]] oil [[H8081]] of pressed [[H3795]] olives [[H2132]] for the light, [[H3974]] to keep the lamps [[H5216]] burning [[H5927]] continually. [[H8548]] 
21 In the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] outside [[H2351]] the veil [[H6532]] that [[H834]] is in front of [[H5921]] the Testimony, [[H5715]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] are to tend [[H6186]] the lamps [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] from evening [[H6153]] until [[H5704]] morning. [[H1242]] This is to be a perpetual [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] throughout [[H854]] their generations. [[H1755]]
