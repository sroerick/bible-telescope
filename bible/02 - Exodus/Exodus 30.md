# Exodus 30
[[Exodus 29|←]] • [[Exodus 31|→]]
1 You are also to make [[H6213]] an altar [[H4196]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] for the burning [[H4729]] of incense. [[H7004]] 
2 It is to be [[H1961]] square, [[H7251]] a cubit [[H520]] long, [[H753]] a cubit [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and two cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]] Its horns [[H7161]] must be of one piece. [[H4480]] 
3 Overlay [[H6823]] the top [[H1406]] and all [[H5439]] the sides [[H7023]] and horns [[H7161]] with pure [[H2889]] gold, [[H2091]] and make [[H6213]] a molding [[H2213]] of gold [[H2091]] all around it. [[H5439]] 
4 And make [[H6213]] for it  two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] below [[H8478]] the molding [[H2213]] on [[H5921]] opposite sides [[H6654]] to [[H1961]] hold [[H1004]] the poles [[H905]] used to carry it. [[H5375]] 
5 Make [[H6213]] the poles [[H905]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] and overlay [[H6823]] them with gold. [[H2091]] 
6 Place [[H5414]] [the altar] [[H853]] in front [[H6440]] of the veil [[H6532]] that is before [[H5921]] the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony— [[H5715]] before [[H6440]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] that [[H834]] is over [[H5921]] the Testimony— [[H5715]] where [[H834]] I will meet [[H3259]] with you.  
7 And Aaron [[H175]] is to burn [[H6999]] fragrant [[H5561]] incense [[H7004]] on it [[H5921]] every morning [[H1242]] when he tends [[H3190]] the lamps. [[H5216]] 
8 When Aaron [[H175]] sets up [[H5927]] the lamps [[H5216]] at [[H996]] twilight, [[H6153]] he must burn [[H6999]] the incense [[H7004]] perpetually [[H8548]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] 
9 On [this altar] [[H5921]] you must not [[H3808]] offer [[H5927]] unapproved [[H2114]] incense [[H7004]] or a burnt offering [[H5930]] or grain offering, [[H4503]] nor are you [[H3808]] to pour [[H5258]] a drink offering [[H5262]] on it. [[H5921]] 
10 Once [[H259]] a year [[H8141]] Aaron [[H175]] shall make atonement [[H3722]] on [[H5921]] the horns [of the altar]. [[H7161]] Throughout your generations [[H1755]] he shall make atonement [[H3722]] on it [[H5921]] annually [[H259]] with the blood [[H1818]] of the sin offering [[H2403]] of atonement. [[H3725]] The altar [is] [[H1931]] most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]] to the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
11 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
12 “When [[H3588]] you take a census [[H5375]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] to number them, [[H6485]] each man [[H376]] must pay [[H5414]] the LORD [[H3068]] a ransom [[H3724]] for his life [[H5315]] when he is counted. [[H6485]] Then no [[H3808]] plague [[H5063]] will come [[H1961]] upon them  when they are numbered. [[H6485]] 
13 Everyone [[H3605]] who crosses [[H5674]] over [[H5921]] to those counted [[H6485]] must pay [[H5414]] a half [[H4276]] shekel, [[H8255]] according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel, [[H8255]] [which weighs] [[H8255]] twenty [[H6242]] gerahs. [[H1626]] This half [[H4276]] shekel [[H8255]] is an offering [[H8641]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
14 Everyone [[H3605]] twenty years [[H6242]] of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who crosses [[H5674]] over [[H5921]] must give [[H5414]] this offering [[H8641]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 In making [[H5414]] the offering [[H8641]] to the LORD [[H3068]] to atone [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] your lives, [[H5315]] the rich [[H6223]] shall not [[H3808]] give more [[H7235]] than a half [[H4276]] shekel, [[H8255]] nor shall [[H3808]] the poor [[H1800]] give less. [[H4591]] 
16 Take [[H3947]] the atonement [[H3722]] money [[H3701]] from the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] and use [[H5414]] it for [[H5921]] the service [[H5656]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] It will serve as [[H1961]] a memorial [[H2146]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] to make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] your lives.” [[H5315]] 
17 Again, the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
18 “You are to make [[H6213]] a bronze [[H5178]] basin [[H3595]] with a bronze [[H5178]] stand [[H3653]] for washing. [[H7364]] Set [[H5414]] it between [[H996]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and the altar, [[H4196]] and put [[H5414]] water [[H4325]] into it, [[H8033]] 
19 with which [[H4480]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] are to wash [[H7364]] their hands [[H3027]] and feet. [[H7272]] 
20 Whenever they enter [[H935]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] or [[H176]] approach [[H5066]] the altar [[H4196]] to minister [[H8334]] by presenting an offering [[H6999]] made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] they must wash [[H7364]] with water [[H4325]] so that they will not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] 
21 Thus they are to wash [[H7364]] their hands [[H3027]] and feet [[H7272]] so that they will not [[H3808]] die; [[H4191]] this shall be [[H1961]] a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2706]] for Aaron and his descendants [[H2233]] for the generations to come.” [[H1755]] 
22 Once again, The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
23 “Take [[H3947]] the finest [[H7218]] spices: [[H1314]] 500 shekels [[H2568]] of liquid [[H1865]] myrrh, [[H4753]] half as much [[H4276]] (250 shekels) [[H2572]] of fragrant [[H1314]] cinnamon, [[H7076]] 250 shekels [[H2572]] of fragrant [[H1314]] cane, [[H7070]] 
24 500 shekels [[H2568]] of cassia— [[H6916]] all according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel— [[H8255]] and a hin [[H1969]] of olive [[H2132]] oil. [[H8081]] 
25 Prepare [[H6213]] from these a holy [[H6944]] anointing [[H4888]] oil, [[H8081]] a fragrant blend, [[H7545]] the work [[H4639]] of a perfumer; [[H7543]] it will be [[H1961]] a holy [[H6944]] anointing [[H4888]] oil. [[H8081]] 
26 Use [this oil] to anoint [[H4886]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony, [[H5715]] 
27 the table [[H7979]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] its utensils, [[H3627]] the lampstand [[H4501]] and [[H853]] its utensils, [[H3627]] the altar [[H4196]] of incense, [[H7004]] 
28 the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] its utensils, [[H3627]] and the basin [[H3595]] with its stand. [[H3653]] 
29 You are to consecrate [[H6942]] them [[H853]] so that they will be [[H1961]] most [[H6944]] holy. [[H6944]] Whatever [[H3605]] touches [[H5060]] them  {will} be holy. [[H6942]] 
30 Anoint [[H4886]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] and consecrate [[H6942]] them [[H853]] to serve Me as priests. [[H3547]] 
31 And you are to tell [[H1696]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘This [[H2088]] will be [[H1961]] My  sacred [[H6944]] anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] 
32 It must not [[H3808]] be used to anoint [[H3251]] an ordinary man, [[H120]] and you must not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] anything like it [[H3644]] with the same formula. [[H4971]] It [[H1931]] is holy, [[H6944]] and it must be [[H1961]] holy [[H6944]] to you.  
33 Anyone [[H376]] who [[H834]] mixes perfume [[H7543]] like it [[H3644]] or puts [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] a layman [[H2114]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from his people.’” [[H5971]] 
34 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Take [[H3947]] fragrant spices— [[H5561]] gum resin, [[H5198]] onycha, [[H7827]] galbanum, [[H2464]] and pure [[H2134]] frankincense— [[H3828]] in equal measures, [[H905]] 
35 and make [[H6213]] a fragrant blend of incense, [[H7004]] the work of a perfumer, [[H7543]] seasoned with salt, [[H4414]] pure [[H2889]] and holy. [[H6944]] 
36 Grind [[H7833]] some of it [[H4480]] into fine powder [[H1854]] and place [[H5414]] it [[H4480]] in front [[H6440]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] where [[H834]] I will meet with you. [[H3259]] It shall be [[H1961]] most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]] to you.  
37 You are never to use [[H6213]] this formula [[H4971]] to make [[H6213]] incense [[H7004]] for yourselves;  you shall regard it as sacred [[H6944]] to  the LORD. [[H3068]] 
38 Anyone [[H376]] who [[H834]] makes [[H6213]] something like [[H3644]] it to enjoy [[H7306]] its fragrance  shall be cut off [[H3772]] from his people.” [[H5971]]
