# Exodus 12
[[Exodus 11|←]] • [[Exodus 13|→]]
1 Now the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] 
2 “This [[H2088]] month [[H2320]] is the beginning [[H7218]] of months for you; [[H2320]] it [shall be] [[H1931]] the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] of your  year. [[H8141]] 
3 Tell [[H1696]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] that on the tenth [[H6218]] day of this [[H2088]] month, [[H2320]] each man [[H376]] must select [[H3947]] a lamb [[H7716]] for his family, [[H1]] one [[H7716]] per household. [[H1004]] 
4 If [[H518]] the household [[H1004]] is too [[H6310]] small [[H4591]] for a whole lamb, [[H7716]] they are to [[H1931]] share with [[H3947]] the nearest [[H7138]] neighbor, [[H7934]] based on the number [[H4373]] of people, [[H5315]] and apportion [[H3699]] the lamb [[H7716]] accordingly. [[H376]] 
5 Your lamb [[H7716]] must be [[H1961]] an unblemished [[H8549]] year-old [[H1121]] male, [[H2145]] [and] you may take [[H3947]] it from [[H4480]] the sheep [[H3532]] or the goats. [[H5795]] 
6 You must care for it [[H1961]] until [[H5704]] the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the [[H2088]] month, [[H2320]] when the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] will slaughter [[H7819]] [the animals] [[H853]] at [[H996]] twilight. [[H6153]] 
7 They are to take [[H3947]] some of [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] and put [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] sideposts [[H4201]] and [[H5921]] tops of the doorframes [[H4947]] of the houses [[H1004]] in which [[H834]] they eat [the lambs]. [[H398]] 
8 They are to eat [[H398]] the meat [[H1320]] that [[H2088]] night, [[H3915]] roasted [[H6748]] over the fire, [[H784]] along with unleavened bread [[H4682]] and bitter herbs. [[H4844]] 
9 Do not [[H408]] eat [[H398]] any of [[H4480]] [the meat] raw [[H4995]] or cooked [[H1310]] in boiling [[H1311]] water, [[H4325]] but only [[H3588]] roasted [[H6748]] over the fire— [[H784]] its head [[H7218]] and [[H5921]] legs [[H3767]] and inner parts. [[H7130]] 
10 Do not [[H3808]] leave [[H3498]] any of it [[H4480]] until [[H5704]] morning; [[H1242]] before [[H5704]] the morning [[H1242]] you must burn up [[H784]] any part [[H4480]] that is left over. [[H3498]] 
11 This is how [[H3602]] you are to eat it: [[H398]] You must be fully dressed for travel, [[H4975]] with your sandals [[H5275]] on your feet [[H7272]] and your staff [[H4731]] in your hand. [[H3027]] You are to eat [[H398]] in haste; [[H2649]] it [[H1931]] is the LORD’s [[H3068]] Passover. [[H6453]] 
12 On that [[H2088]] night [[H3915]] I will pass [[H5674]] through the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and strike down [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] firstborn male, [[H1060]] both man [[H120]] and [[H5704]] beast, [[H929]] and I will execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H8201]] against all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 The blood [[H1818]] on [[H5921]] the houses [[H1004]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] are staying [[H8033]] will [[H1961]] distinguish them; [[H226]] when I see [[H7200]] the blood, [[H1818]] I will pass [[H6452]] over you. [[H5921]] No [[H3808]] plague [[H5063]] will fall [[H1961]] on you  to destroy you [[H4889]] when I strike [[H5221]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
14 And this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] will be [[H1961]] a memorial for you, [[H2146]] and you are to celebrate [[H2287]] it [[H853]] as a feast [[H2282]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] as a lasting [[H5769]] ordinance [[H2708]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] 
15 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] you must eat [[H398]] unleavened bread. [[H4682]] On the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] you are to remove [[H7673]] the yeast [[H7603]] from your houses. [[H1004]] Whoever [[H3605]] eats [[H398]] anything leavened [[H2557]] from the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] through [[H5704]] the seventh [[H7637]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from Israel. [[H3478]] 
16 On the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] you are to hold [[H1961]] a sacred [[H6944]] assembly, [[H4744]] and another [[H6944]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day. [[H3117]] You must  not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] any work [[H4399]] on those days, [[H389]] except to prepare [[H834]] the meals— [[H398]] that [[H1931]] is all [[H905]] you may do. [[H6213]] 
17 So you are to observe [[H8104]] the Feast of Unleavened Bread, [[H4682]] for [[H3588]] on this [[H2088]] very [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] I brought [[H3318]] your divisions [[H6635]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] You must observe [[H8104]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] as a lasting [[H5769]] ordinance [[H2708]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] 
18 In the first [month] [[H7223]] you are to eat [[H398]] unleavened bread, [[H4682]] from the evening [[H6153]] of the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] the evening [[H6153]] of the twenty-first [[H259]] day. [[H3117]] 
19 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] there must be no [[H3808]] yeast [[H7603]] found [[H4672]] in your houses. [[H1004]] If [[H3588]] anyone [[H3605]] eats [[H398]] something leavened, [[H2557]] that [[H1931]] person, [[H5315]] whether a foreigner [[H1616]] or native [[H249]] of the land, [[H776]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
20 {You are} not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] anything [[H3605]] leavened; [[H2557]] eat [[H398]] unleavened bread [[H4682]] in all [[H3605]] your homes.” [[H4186]] 
21 Then Moses [[H4872]] summoned [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] and told [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “Go at once [[H4900]] and select [[H3947]] for yourselves  a lamb [[H6629]] for each family, [[H4940]] and slaughter [[H7819]] the Passover lamb. [[H6453]] 
22 Take [[H3947]] a cluster [[H92]] of hyssop, [[H231]] dip [[H2881]] it into the blood [[H1818]] in the basin, [[H5592]] and brush [[H5060]] the top [[H4947]] and the two [[H8147]] sideposts of the doorframe [[H4201]] with some of [[H4480]] the blood. [[H1818]] None [[H3808]] of you [[H859]] shall go out [[H3318]] the door [[H6607]] of his house [[H1004]] until [[H5704]] morning. [[H1242]] 
23 When the LORD [[H3068]] passes through [[H5674]] to strike down [[H5062]] the Egyptians, [[H4713]] He will see [[H7200]] the blood [[H1818]] on [[H5921]] the top [[H4947]] and the two [[H8147]] sideposts [[H4201]] and pass [[H6452]] over [[H5921]] the door; [[H6607]] so He will not [[H3808]] allow [[H5414]] the destroyer [[H7843]] to enter [[H935]] your houses [[H1004]] and strike you down. [[H5062]] 
24 And you are to keep [[H8104]] this [[H2088]] command [[H1697]] as a perpetual [[H5704]] ordinance [[H2706]] for you  and your descendants. [[H1121]] 
25 When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] will give you [[H5414]] as [[H834]] He promised, [[H1696]] you are to observe [[H8104]] this [[H2063]] service. [[H5656]] 
26 When [[H3588]] your children [[H1121]] ask you, [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] does this service [[H5656]] mean [[H2063]] to you?’  
27 you are to reply, [[H559]] ‘It [[H1931]] is the Passover [[H6453]] sacrifice [[H2077]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] passed [[H6452]] over [[H5921]] the houses [[H1004]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] in Egypt [[H4714]] when He struck down [[H5062]] the Egyptians [[H853]] and spared [[H5337]] our homes.’” [[H1004]] Then the people [[H5971]] bowed down [[H6915]] and worshiped. [[H7812]] 
28 And the Israelites [[H1121]] went [[H1980]] and did [[H6213]] just what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron. [[H175]] 
29 Now [[H1961]] at midnight [[H2677]] the LORD [[H3068]] struck down [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H1060]] male in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from the firstborn [[H1060]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] who sat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his throne, [[H3678]] to [[H5704]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of the prisoner [[H7628]] in the dungeon, [[H1004]] as well as all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] among the livestock. [[H929]] 
30 During the night [[H3915]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] got up— [[H6965]] he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] his officials [[H5650]] and all [[H3605]] the Egyptians— [[H4714]] and there was [[H1961]] loud [[H1419]] wailing [[H6818]] in Egypt; [[H3588]] for there was no [[H369]] house [[H1004]] without [[H369]] someone dead. [[H4191]] 
31 Then [Pharaoh] summoned [[H7121]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] by night [[H3915]] and said, [[H559]] “Get up, [[H6965]] leave [[H3318]] my people, [[H5971]] both [[H1571]] you [[H859]] and [[H1571]] the Israelites! [[H1121]] Go, [[H1980]] worship [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] as you have requested. [[H1696]] 
32 Take [[H3947]] your flocks [[H6629]] and [[H1571]] herds [[H1241]] as well, [[H1571]] just as [[H834]] you have said, [[H1696]] and depart! [[H1980]] And bless [[H1288]] me [[H853]] also.” [[H1571]] 
33 And in order to send them [[H7971]] out of [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] quickly, [[H4116]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] urged [[H2388]] the people on. [[H5971]] “For [otherwise],” [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] “we are all [[H3605]] going to die!” [[H4191]] 
34 So the people [[H5971]] took [[H5375]] their dough [[H1217]] before [[H2962]] it was leavened, [[H2556]] [carrying it] on [[H5921]] their shoulders [[H7926]] in kneading bowls [[H4863]] wrapped [[H6887]] in clothing. [[H8071]] 
35 Furthermore, the Israelites [[H1121]] acted [[H6213]] on Moses’ [[H4872]] word [[H1697]] and asked [[H7592]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] for articles [[H3627]] of silver [[H3701]] and [[H3627]] gold, [[H2091]] and for clothing. [[H8071]] 
36 And the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] the people [[H5971]] such favor [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Egyptians [[H4713]] that they granted their request. [[H7592]] In this way they plundered [[H5337]] the Egyptians. [[H4713]] 
37 The Israelites [[H1121]] journeyed [[H5265]] from Rameses [[H7486]] to Succoth [[H5523]] with about 600,000 [[H8337]] men [[H1397]] on foot, [[H7273]] besides [[H905]] women and children. [[H2945]] 
38 And a mixed [[H6154]] multitude [[H7227]] also [[H1571]] went up [[H5927]] with them, [[H854]] along with great droves of [[H3515]] livestock, [[H4735]] both flocks [[H6629]] and herds. [[H1241]] 
39 Since [[H3588]] their dough [[H1217]] had no [[H3808]] yeast, [[H2556]] the people baked [[H644]] what they had brought [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] into unleavened [[H4682]] loaves. [[H5692]] For [[H3588]] when they had been driven out [[H1644]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] delay [[H4102]] and [[H1571]] had not [[H3808]] prepared [[H6213]] any provisions [[H6720]] for themselves.  
40 Now the duration [[H4186]] of the Israelites’ [[H1121]] stay [[H3427]] in Egypt [[H4714]] was 430 [[H7970]] years. [[H8141]] 
41 At the end [[H7093]] of the 430 [[H7970]] years, [[H8141]] to the [[H2088]] very [[H6106]] day, [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] divisions [[H6635]] went out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
42 Because the LORD [[H3068]] kept a vigil [[H8107]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] to bring them out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] this same [[H2088]] night [is to be a vigil ] [[H3915]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] to be observed [[H8107]] by all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] 
43 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] “This [[H2063]] is the ordinance [[H2708]] of the Passover: [[H6453]] No [[H3605]] foreigner [[H1121]] is to eat [[H398]] of it.  
44 But any [[H3605]] slave [who] [[H5650]] has been purchased [[H4736]] may eat of it, [[H398]] after you have circumcised him. [[H4135]] 
45 A temporary resident [[H8453]] or hired hand [[H7916]] shall not [[H3808]] eat the Passover. [[H398]] 
46 It must be eaten [[H398]] inside one [[H259]] house. [[H1004]] You are not [[H3808]] to take [[H3318]] any of [[H4480]] the meat [[H1320]] outside [[H4480]] the house, [[H1004]] and you may not [[H3808]] break [[H7665]] any of the bones. [[H6106]] 
47 The whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] must celebrate [[H6213]] it. [[H853]] 
48 If [[H3588]] a foreigner [[H1616]] resides [[H1481]] with [[H854]] you and wants to celebrate [[H6213]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] Passover, [[H6453]] all the [[H3605]] males [in the household] [[H2145]] must be circumcised; [[H4135]] then [[H227]] he may come near [[H7126]] to celebrate it, [[H6213]] and he shall be [[H1961]] like a native [[H249]] of the land. [[H776]] But no [[H3808]] uncircumcised man [[H6189]] may eat [[H398]] of it.  
49 The same [[H259]] law [[H8451]] shall apply [[H1961]] to both the native [[H249]] and the foreigner [[H1616]] who resides [[H1481]] among you.” [[H8432]] 
50 Then all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] this— [[H3651]] they did [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron. [[H175]] 
51 And [[H1961]] on that [[H2088]] very [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] brought [[H3318]] the Israelites [[H1121]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] by [[H5921]] their divisions. [[H6635]]
