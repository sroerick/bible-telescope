# Exodus 14
[[Exodus 13|←]] • [[Exodus 15|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Tell [[H1696]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to [[H413]] turn back [[H7725]] and encamp [[H2583]] before [[H6440]] Pi-hahiroth, [[H6367]] between [[H996]] Migdol [[H4024]] and the sea. [[H3220]] You are to encamp [[H2583]] by [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] directly opposite [[H6440]] Baal-zephon. [[H1189]] 
3 For Pharaoh [[H6547]] will say [[H559]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘They [[H1992]] are wandering the land [[H776]] in confusion; [[H943]] the wilderness [[H4057]] has boxed them [[H5462]] in.’ [[H5921]] 
4 And I will harden [[H2388]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] so that he will pursue [[H7291]] them. [[H310]] But I will gain honor [[H3513]] by means of Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his army, [[H2426]] and the Egyptians [[H4713]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.” [[H3068]] So this is what [[H3651]] the Israelites did. [[H6213]] 
5 When the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] was told [[H5046]] that [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] had fled, [[H1272]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and his officials [[H5650]] changed [[H2015]] their minds [[H3824]] about [[H413]] [them] [[H5971]] and said, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] have we done? [[H6213]] We have released [[H7971]] Israel [[H3478]] from serving us.” [[H5647]] 
6 So [Pharaoh] prepared [[H631]] his chariot [[H7393]] and took [[H3947]] his army [[H5971]] with him. [[H5973]] 
7 He took [[H3947]] 600 [[H8337]] of the best [[H970]] chariots, [[H7393]] and all [[H3605]] the other chariots [[H7393]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] with officers [[H7991]] over [[H5921]] all of them. [[H3605]] 
8 And the LORD [[H3068]] hardened [[H2388]] the heart [[H3820]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] so that he pursued [[H7291]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] who were marching out [[H3318]] with fists [[H3027]] raised [in defiance]. [[H7311]] 
9 The Egyptians— [[H4713]] all [[H3605]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] horses [[H5483]] and chariots, [[H7393]] horsemen [[H6571]] and troops— [[H2428]] pursued [[H7291]] and [[H310]] overtook [[H5381]] [the Israelites] [[H853]] as they camped [[H2583]] by [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] near [[H5921]] Pi-hahiroth, [[H6367]] opposite [[H6440]] Baal-zephon. [[H1189]] 
10 As Pharaoh [[H6547]] approached, [[H7126]] the Israelites [[H1121]] looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H2009]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] marching [[H5265]] after them, [[H310]] and [they] [[H1121]] were terrified [[H3372]] and cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 They said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Was it because [[H369]] there are no [[H1097]] graves [[H6913]] in Egypt [[H4714]] that you brought us [[H3947]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] to die? [[H4191]] What [[H4100]] have you done [[H6213]] to us  by bringing us out [[H3318]] of Egypt? [[H4714]] 
12 {Did we} not [[H3808]] say [[H1696]] to you [[H413]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] ‘Leave us alone [[H2308]] so that we may serve [[H5647]] the Egyptians’? [[H4713]] For [[H3588]] it would have been better [[H2896]] for us  to serve [[H5647]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] than to die [[H4191]] in the wilderness.” [[H4057]] 
13 But Moses [[H4872]] told [[H559]] the people, [[H5971]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid. [[H3372]] Stand firm [[H3320]] and you will see [[H7200]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] salvation, [[H3444]] which He will accomplish [[H6213]] for you  today; [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] the Egyptians [[H834]] you see today, [[H7200]] you will never [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] again. [[H3254]] 
14 The LORD [[H3068]] will fight for you; [[H3898]] you [[H859]] need only to be still.” [[H2790]] 
15 The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Why [[H4100]] are you crying out [[H6817]] to Me? [[H413]] Tell [[H1696]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to go forward. [[H5265]] 
16 And as for you, [[H859]] lift up [[H7311]] your staff [[H4294]] and stretch out [[H5186]] your hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] and divide it, [[H1234]] so that the Israelites [[H1121]] can go [[H935]] through [[H8432]] the sea [[H3220]] on dry ground. [[H3004]] 
17 And I [[H589]] will harden [[H2388]] the hearts [[H3820]] of the Egyptians [[H4713]] so that they will go in [[H935]] after them. [[H310]] Then I will gain honor [[H3513]] by means of Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his army [[H2426]] and chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen. [[H6571]] 
18 The Egyptians [[H4713]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] when I am honored [[H3513]] through Pharaoh, [[H6547]] his chariots, [[H7393]] and his horsemen.” [[H6571]] 
19 Then the Angel [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] who had gone [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] the camp [[H4264]] of Israel, [[H3478]] withdrew [[H5265]] and went [[H1980]] behind them. [[H310]] The pillar [[H5982]] of cloud [[H6051]] also moved [[H5265]] from before them [[H6440]] and stood [[H5975]] behind them, [[H310]] 
20 so that it came [[H935]] between [[H996]] the camps [[H4264]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and [[H996]] Israel. [[H3478]] The cloud [[H6051]] was [[H1961]] there in the darkness, [[H2822]] but it lit up [[H215]] the night. [[H3915]] So all [[H3605]] night long [[H3915]] neither [camp] [[H3808]] went near [[H7126]] the other. [[H2088]] 
21 Then Moses [[H4872]] stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] and all [[H3605]] that night [[H3915]] the LORD [[H3068]] drove back [[H1980]] the sea [[H3220]] with a strong [[H5794]] east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] that turned [[H7760]] [it] [[H3220]] into dry land. [[H2724]] So the waters [[H4325]] were divided, [[H1234]] 
22 and the Israelites [[H1121]] went [[H935]] through [[H8432]] the sea [[H3220]] on dry ground, [[H3004]] with walls [[H2346]] of water [[H4325]] on their right [[H3225]] and on their left. [[H8040]] 
23 Then the Egyptians [[H4713]] chased after them— [[H7291]] all [[H3605]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] horses, [[H5483]] chariots, [[H7393]] and horsemen— [[H6571]] and followed [[H935]] them [[H310]] into [[H413]] the sea. [[H3220]] 
24 At morning [[H1242]] watch, [[H821]] however, [[H1961]] the LORD [[H3068]] looked down [[H8259]] on [[H413]] the army [[H4264]] of the Egyptians [[H4713]] from the pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] and cloud, [[H6051]] and He threw their camp into confusion. [[H2000]] 
25 He caused their chariot [[H4818]] wheels [[H212]] to wobble, [[H5493]] so that they had difficulty [[H3517]] driving. [[H5090]] “Let us flee [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] the Israelites,” [[H3478]] said [[H559]] the Egyptians, [[H4713]] “for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is fighting [[H3898]] for them  against Egypt!” [[H4713]] 
26 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Stretch out [[H5186]] your hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] so that the waters [[H4325]] may flow back [[H7725]] over [[H5921]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] [and] [[H5921]] their chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen.” [[H6571]] 
27 So Moses [[H4872]] stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] and at daybreak [[H6437]] the sea [[H3220]] returned [[H7725]] to its normal state. [[H386]] While the Egyptians [[H4713]] were retreating, [[H5127]] the LORD [[H3068]] swept them [[H5287]] into [[H8432]] the sea. [[H3220]] 
28 The waters [[H4325]] flowed back [[H7725]] and covered [[H3680]] the chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen— [[H6571]] the entire [[H3605]] army [[H2426]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] that had chased [[H935]] [the Israelites] [[H310]] into the sea. [[H3220]] Not [[H3808]] one of them [[H259]] survived. [[H7604]] 
29 But the Israelites [[H1121]] had walked [[H1980]] through [[H8432]] the sea [[H3220]] on dry ground, [[H3004]] with walls [[H2346]] of water [[H4325]] on their  right [[H3225]] and on their left. [[H8040]] 
30 That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] saved [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians, [[H4713]] and Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] dead [[H4191]] on [[H5921]] the shore. [[H8193]] 
31 When Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] the great [[H1419]] power [[H3027]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had exercised [[H6213]] over the Egyptians, [[H4713]] the people [[H5971]] feared [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] and believed [[H539]] in Him [[H3068]] and in His servant [[H5650]] Moses.
