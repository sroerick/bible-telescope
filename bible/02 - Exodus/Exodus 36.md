# Exodus 36
[[Exodus 35|←]] • [[Exodus 37|→]]
1 So Bezalel, [[H1212]] Oholiab, [[H171]] and every [[H3605]] skilled [[H2450]] person [[H376]] are to carry out [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] commanded [[H6680]] by the LORD, [[H3068]] [who] [[H3068]] has given [[H5414]] them [[H1992]] skill [[H2451]] and understanding [[H8394]] to know [[H3045]] how to perform [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] of constructing [[H5656]] the sanctuary.” [[H6944]] 
2 Then Moses [[H4872]] summoned [[H7121]] Bezalel, [[H1212]] Oholiab, [[H171]] and every [[H3605]] skilled [[H2450]] person [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had gifted— [[H5414]] everyone [[H3605]] whose [[H834]] heart [[H3820]] stirred him [[H5375]] to come [[H7126]] and do [[H6213]] the work. [[H4399]] 
3 They received [[H3947]] from Moses [[H4872]] all [[H3605]] the contributions [[H8641]] that [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had brought [[H935]] to carry out [[H4399]] the service [[H5656]] of constructing [[H6213]] the sanctuary. [[H6944]] Meanwhile, the people [[H1992]] continued to bring [[H935]] freewill offerings [[H5071]] morning [[H1242]] after morning, [[H1242]] 
4 so that all [[H3605]] the skilled craftsmen [[H2450]] who were doing [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] on the sanctuary [[H6944]] left [[H935]] their work [[H4399]] 
5 and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “The people [[H5971]] are bringing [[H935]] more [[H7235]] than enough [[H1767]] for doing [[H5656]] the work [[H4399]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded [[H6680]] us [[H853]] to do.” [[H6213]] 
6 After Moses [[H4872]] had given an order, [[H6680]] they sent [[H5674]] a proclamation [[H6963]] throughout the camp: [[H4264]] “No [[H408]] man [[H376]] or woman [[H802]] should make [[H6213]] anything [[H4399]] else [[H5750]] as an offering [[H8641]] for the sanctuary.” [[H6944]] So the people [[H5971]] were restrained [[H3607]] from bringing more, [[H935]] 
7 since what they already had [[H1961]] was more [[H3498]] than enough [[H1767]] to perform [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the work. [[H4399]] 
8 All [[H3605]] the skilled craftsmen [[H2450]] among the workmen [[H6213]] made [[H6213]] the ten [[H6235]] curtains [[H3407]] for the tabernacle. [[H4908]] They were made [[H6213]] of finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] as well as blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] with a design [[H2803]] of cherubim [[H3742]] worked into them. [[H4639]] 
9 The length [[H753]] of each [[H259]] curtain [[H3407]] was twenty-eight [[H8083]] cubits, [[H520]] and width [[H7341]] of each [[H259]] curtain [[H3407]] [was] four [[H702]] cubits; [[H520]] all [[H3605]] the curtains [[H3407]] had the same [[H259]] measurements, [[H4060]] 
10 and he joined [[H2266]] five [[H2568]] of the curtains [[H3407]] together, [[H413]] and the other five [[H2568]] he joined [[H2266]] as well. [[H413]] 
11 He fashioned [[H6213]] loops [[H3924]] of blue yarn [[H8504]] on [[H5921]] the edge [[H8193]] of the end [[H7098]] curtain [[H3407]] in the first [[H259]] set, [[H4225]] and also [[H6213]] on the end [[H7020]] curtain [[H3407]] in the second [[H8145]] set. [[H4225]] 
12 He made [[H6213]] fifty [[H2572]] loops [[H3924]] on the one [[H259]] curtain [[H3407]] and fifty [[H2572]] loops [[H3924]] on the end [[H7097]] curtain [[H3407]] of the second [[H8145]] set, [[H4225]] so that the loops [[H3924]] lined up [[H6901]] opposite [[H413]] one [[H259]] another. [[H259]] 
13 He also made [[H6213]] fifty [[H2572]] gold [[H2091]] clasps [[H7165]] to join [[H2266]] the curtains [[H3407]] to [[H413]] each [[H259]] other, [[H259]] so that the tabernacle [[H4908]] was [[H1961]] a single unit. [[H259]] 
14 He then made [[H6213]] curtains [[H3407]] of goat hair [[H5795]] for the tent [[H168]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle— [[H4908]] eleven [[H6249]] curtains [[H3407]] altogether. [[H6213]] 
15 The length [[H753]] of each [[H259]] curtain [[H3407]] [was] thirty [[H7970]] cubits, [[H520]] and the width [[H7341]] of each [[H259]] curtain [[H3407]] [was] four [[H702]] cubits; [[H520]] each of the eleven [[H6249]] curtains [[H3407]] had the same [[H259]] measurements. [[H4060]] 
16 He joined [[H2266]] five [[H2568]] of the curtains together, [[H3407]] and the other [[H3407]] six together. [[H8337]] 
17 He made [[H6213]] fifty [[H2572]] loops [[H3924]] along [[H5921]] the edge [[H8193]] of the end [[H7020]] curtain [[H3407]] in the first set, [[H4225]] and fifty [[H2572]] loops [[H3924]] on [[H5921]] the edge [[H8193]] of the end curtain [[H3407]] in the second [[H8145]] set. [[H2279]] 
18 He also made [[H6213]] fifty [[H2572]] bronze [[H5178]] clasps [[H7165]] to join the tent [[H168]] together [[H2266]] as a unit. [[H259]] 
19 Additionally, he made [[H6213]] for the tent [[H168]] a covering [[H4372]] of ram [[H352]] skins [[H5785]] dyed red, [[H119]] and over [[H4605]] that  a covering [[H4372]] of fine leather. [[H8476]] 
20 Next, he constructed [[H6213]] upright [[H5975]] frames [[H7175]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] for the tabernacle. [[H4908]] 
21 Each frame [[H7175]] [was] ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and a [[H259]] cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] wide. [[H7341]] 
22 Two [[H8147]] tenons [[H3027]] were connected [[H7947]] to [[H413]] each [[H259]] other [[H259]] for each [[H259]] frame. [[H7175]] He made [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the frames [[H7175]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] in this way. [[H3651]] 
23 He made [[H6213]] the [[H853]] frames [[H7175]] for the tabernacle [[H4908]] [as follows:] twenty [[H6242]] frames [[H7175]] for the south [[H5045]] side, [[H6285]] 
24 [along with] [[H6213]] forty [[H705]] silver [[H3701]] bases [[H134]] to put under [[H8478]] the twenty [[H6242]] frames— [[H7175]] two [[H8147]] bases [[H134]] under [[H8478]] each frame, [[H7175]] one [[H259]] under [[H8478]] each [[H259]] tenon. [[H3027]] 
25 For the second [[H8145]] side [[H6763]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the north [[H6828]] side, [[H6285]] he made [[H6213]] twenty [[H6242]] frames, [[H7175]] 
26 with their forty [[H705]] silver [[H3701]] bases, [[H134]] two [[H8147]] under [[H8478]] each [[H259]] frame. [[H7175]] 
27 For the west [[H3220]] side [[H3411]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] he made [[H6213]] six [[H8337]] frames. [[H7175]] 
28 He also made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] frames [[H7175]] for the two back corners [[H3411]] of the tabernacle. [[H4908]] 
29 They were [[H1961]] joined together [[H8382]] from bottom [[H4295]] to [[H413]] top [[H7218]] into [[H413]] a single [[H259]] ring. [[H2885]] He made [[H6213]] both [[H8147]] corners [[H4740]] in this way. [[H3651]] 
30 So there were [[H1961]] eight [[H8083]] frames [[H7175]] with sixteen [[H8337]] silver [[H3701]] bases, [[H134]] two [[H8147]] under [[H8478]] each [[H259]] frame. [[H7175]] 
31 He also made [[H6213]] crossbars [[H1280]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood: [[H6086]] five [[H2568]] for the frames [[H7175]] on one [[H259]] side [[H6763]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] 
32 five [[H2568]] for the frames [[H7175]] on the other [[H8145]] side, [[H6763]] and five [[H2568]] for those [[H7175]] at the back [[H3411]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] to the west. [[H3220]] 
33 He made [[H6213]] the central [[H8484]] crossbar [[H1280]] to run through [[H1272]] the center [[H8432]] of the frames, [[H7175]] from [[H4480]] one end [[H7097]] to [[H413]] the other. [[H7097]] 
34 And [[H853]] he overlaid [[H6823]] the frames [[H7175]] with gold [[H2091]] and made [[H6213]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] to hold [[H1004]] the crossbars. [[H1280]] He also overlaid [[H6823]] the crossbars [[H1280]] with gold. [[H2091]] 
35 Next, he made [[H6213]] the veil [[H6532]] [of] blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] [with] cherubim [[H3742]] skillfully [[H2803]] worked [into it]. [[H4639]] 
36 He also made [[H6213]] four [[H702]] posts [[H5982]] of acacia wood [[H7848]] for it  and overlaid [[H6823]] them with gold, [[H2091]] along with gold [[H2091]] hooks; [[H2053]] and he cast [[H3332]] four [[H702]] silver [[H3701]] bases [[H134]] for the posts.  
37 For the entrance [[H6607]] to the tent, [[H168]] he made [[H6213]] a curtain [[H4539]] embroidered [[H7551]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] 
38 together with [[H853]] five [[H2568]] posts [[H5982]] and their hooks. [[H2053]] He overlaid [[H6823]] the tops [[H7218]] of the posts and their bands [[H2838]] with gold, [[H2091]] and their five [[H2568]] bases [[H134]] were bronze. [[H5178]]
