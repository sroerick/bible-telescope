# Exodus 23
[[Exodus 22|←]] • [[Exodus 24|→]]
1 You shall not [[H3808]] spread [[H5375]] a false [[H7723]] report. [[H8088]] Do not [[H408]] join [[H7896]] the wicked [[H7563]] by being [[H1961]] a malicious [[H2555]] witness. [[H5707]] 
2 You shall not [[H3808]] follow [[H1961]] a crowd [[H7227]] in wrongdoing. [[H7451]] When you testify [[H6030]] in [[H5921]] a lawsuit, [[H7379]] do not [[H3808]] pervert justice [[H5186]] by siding [[H5186]] with [[H310]] a crowd. [[H7227]] 
3 And do not [[H3808]] show favoritism [[H1921]] to a poor man [[H1800]] in his lawsuit. [[H7379]] 
4 If [[H3588]] you encounter [[H6293]] your enemy’s [[H341]] stray [[H8582]] ox [[H7794]] or [[H176]] donkey, [[H2543]] you must return [[H7725]] it to him. [[H7725]] 
5 If [[H3588]] you see [[H7200]] the donkey [[H2543]] of one who hates you [[H8130]] fallen [[H7257]] under [[H8478]] its load, [[H4853]] do not [[H2308]] leave [[H5800]] it there;  you must help him [[H5800]] with it. [[H5973]] 
6 You shall not [[H3808]] deny [[H5186]] justice [[H4941]] to the poor [[H34]] in their lawsuits. [[H7379]] 
7 Stay far away [[H7368]] from a false [[H8267]] accusation. [[H1697]] Do not [[H408]] kill [[H2026]] the innocent [[H5355]] and the just, [[H6662]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] acquit [[H6663]] the guilty. [[H7563]] 
8 Do not [[H3808]] accept [[H3947]] a bribe, [[H7810]] for [[H3588]] a bribe [[H7810]] blinds [[H5786]] those who see [[H6493]] and twists [[H5557]] the words [[H1697]] of the righteous. [[H6662]] 
9 Do not [[H3808]] oppress [[H3905]] a foreign resident, [[H1616]] since you [[H859]] yourselves know [[H3045]] how it feels to be foreigners; [[H1616]] for [[H3588]] you were [[H1961]] foreigners [[H1616]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
10 For six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] you are to sow [[H2232]] your land [[H776]] and gather [[H622]] its produce, [[H8393]] 
11 but in the seventh [year] [[H7637]] you must let it rest [[H8058]] and lie fallow, [[H5203]] so that the poor [[H34]] among your people [[H5971]] may eat [[H398]] of the field, [[H7704]] and the wild animals [[H2416]] may consume [[H398]] what they leave. [[H3499]] Do [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] with your vineyard [[H3754]] and olive grove. [[H2132]] 
12 For six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] you are to do [[H6213]] your work, [[H4639]] but on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] you must cease, [[H7673]] so that [[H4616]] your ox [[H7794]] and your donkey [[H2543]] may rest, [[H5117]] and the son [[H1121]] of your maidservant [[H519]] may be refreshed, [[H5314]] as well as the foreign resident. [[H1616]] 
13 Pay close attention [[H8104]] to everything [[H3605]] I have said [[H559]] to you. [[H413]] You must not [[H3808]] invoke [[H2142]] the names [[H8034]] of other [[H312]] gods; [[H430]] they must not [[H3808]] be heard [[H8085]] on [[H5921]] your lips. [[H6310]] 
14 Three [[H7969]] times [[H7272]] a year [[H8141]] you are to celebrate a feast [[H2287]] to Me.  
15 You are to observe [[H8104]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Unleavened Bread [[H4682]] as [[H834]] I commanded you: [[H6680]] At the appointed time [[H4150]] in the month [[H2320]] of Abib [[H24]] you are to eat [[H398]] unleavened bread [[H4682]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] that [was the month]  you came out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] No one [[H3808]] may appear [[H7200]] before Me [[H6440]] empty-handed. [[H7387]] 
16 [You are also to observe] the Feast [[H2282]] of Harvest [[H7105]] with the firstfruits [[H1061]] of the produce [[H4639]] from what [[H834]] you sow [[H2232]] in the field. [[H7704]] And [observe] the Feast [[H2282]] of Ingathering [[H614]] at the end [[H3318]] of the year, [[H8141]] when you gather [[H622]] your produce [[H4639]] from [[H4480]] the field. [[H7704]] 
17 Three [[H7969]] times [[H6471]] a year [[H8141]] all [[H3605]] your males [[H2138]] are to appear [[H7200]] before [[H413]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3068]] 
18 You must not [[H3808]] offer [[H2076]] the blood [[H1818]] of My sacrifices [[H2077]] with [[H5921]] anything leavened, [[H2557]] nor may [[H3808]] the fat [[H2459]] of My feast [[H2282]] remain [[H3885]] until [[H5704]] morning. [[H1242]] 
19 Bring [[H935]] the best [[H7225]] of the firstfruits [[H1061]] of your soil [[H127]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] You must not [[H3808]] cook [[H1310]] a young goat [[H1423]] in its mother’s [[H517]] milk. [[H2461]] 
20 Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] am sending [[H7971]] an angel [[H4397]] before you [[H6440]] to protect you [[H8104]] along the way [[H1870]] and to bring you [[H935]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] I have prepared. [[H3559]] 
21 Pay attention [[H8104]] to him [[H6440]] and listen [[H8085]] to his voice; [[H6963]] do not [[H408]] defy [[H4843]] him,  for [[H3588]] he will not [[H3808]] forgive [[H5375]] rebellion, [[H6588]] since [[H3588]] My Name [[H8034]] is in him. [[H7130]] 
22 But [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you will listen carefully [[H8085]] to his voice [[H6963]] and do [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] I say, [[H1696]] I will be an enemy [[H340]] to your enemies [[H341]] and a foe [[H6696]] to your foes. [[H6887]] 
23 For [[H3588]] My angel [[H4397]] will go [[H1980]] before you [[H6440]] and bring you [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land of the Amorites, [[H567]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites, [[H2983]] and I will annihilate them. [[H3582]] 
24 You must not [[H3808]] bow down [[H7812]] to their gods [[H430]] or serve them [[H5647]] or [[H3808]] follow [[H6213]] their practices. [[H4639]] Instead, [[H3588]] you are to demolish them [[H2040]] and smash their sacred stones [[H4676]] to pieces. [[H7665]] 
25 So you shall serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and He will bless [[H1288]] your bread [[H3899]] and [[H853]] your water. [[H4325]] And I will take away [[H5493]] sickness [[H4245]] from among you. [[H7130]] 
26 No [[H3808]] {woman} in your land [[H776]] will miscarry [[H7921]] or be barren; [[H6135]] I will fulfill [[H4390]] the number [[H4557]] of your days. [[H3117]] 
27 I will send [[H7971]] My terror [[H367]] ahead of you [[H6440]] and throw into confusion [[H2000]] every [[H3605]] nation [[H5971]] you encounter. [[H935]] I will make all [[H3605]] your enemies [[H341]] turn [[H5414]] and run. [[H413]] 
28 I will send [[H7971]] the hornet [[H6880]] before you [[H6440]] to drive [[H1644]] the Hivites [[H2340]] and Canaanites [[H3669]] and Hittites [[H2850]] out of your way. [[H6440]] 
29 I will not [[H3808]] drive them out [[H1644]] before you [[H6440]] in a single [[H259]] year; [[H8141]] otherwise [[H6435]] the land [[H776]] would become [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] and wild [[H7704]] animals [[H2416]] would multiply [[H7227]] against you. [[H5921]] 
30 Little [[H4592]] by little [[H4592]] I will drive them out [[H1644]] ahead of you, [[H6440]] until [[H5704]] you become fruitful [[H6509]] and possess [[H5157]] the land. [[H776]] 
31 And I will fix [[H7896]] your borders [[H1366]] from the Red [[H5488]] Sea [[H3220]] to [[H5704]] the Sea [[H3220]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and from the desert [[H4057]] to [[H5704]] the [Euphrates]. [[H5104]] For [[H3588]] I will deliver [[H5414]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] into your hand, [[H3027]] and you will drive them out [[H1644]] before you. [[H6440]] 
32 You shall make [[H3772]] no [[H3808]] covenant [[H1285]] with them  or with their gods. [[H430]] 
33 They must not [[H3808]] remain [[H3427]] in your land, [[H776]] lest [[H6435]] they cause you to sin against Me. [[H2398]] For [[H3588]] if you serve [[H5647]] their gods, [[H430]] it will surely [[H3588]] be [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] to you.”
