[[Mark 1|←]] • [[Mark 3|→]]
1 [A few] days [[G2250]] later, [[G1223]] [Jesus] went back to [[G1525]] Capernaum. [[G2584]] And when [the people] heard [[G191]] He was [[G1510]] home, [[G3624]] 
2 they gathered [[G4863]] in such large numbers [[G4183]] that [there was] [[G5620]] no more [[G3371]] room, [[G5562]] not even [[G3366]] outside [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] door, [[G2374]] [as Jesus] spoke [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] to them. [[G846]] 
3 Then [[G2532]] a paralytic [[G3885]] was brought [[G5342]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] carried [[G142]] by [[G5259]] four [men]. [[G5064]] 
4 Since [[G2532]] they were unable [[G1410]] to get to [[G4374]] [Jesus] [[G846]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] they uncovered [[G648]] the [[G3588]] roof [[G4721]] above Him, [[G3699]] made an opening, [[G1846]] [and] lowered [[G5465]] the [[G3588]] paralytic [[G3885]] on [[G3699]] [his] [[G3588]] mat. [[G2895]] 
5 When [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] their [[G846]] faith, [[G4102]] He said [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] paralytic, [[G3885]] “Son, [[G5043]] your [[G4771]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven.” [[G863]] 
6 But [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] were [[G1510]] sitting [[G2521]] there [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] contemplating [[G1260]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] 
7 “Why [[G5101]] {does} this [man] [[G3778]] speak [[G2980]] like this? [[G3779]] He is blaspheming! [[G987]] Who [[G5101]] can [[G1410]] forgive [[G863]] sins [[G266]] but [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] alone?” [[G1520]] 
8 At once [[G2112]] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1921]] in [[G3588]] His [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G3754]] they were considering [[G1260]] this [[G3779]] within [[G1722]] themselves. [[G1438]] “Why [[G5101]] do you question [[G1260]] these things [[G3778]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts?” [[G2588]] He asked. [[G3004]] 
9 “Which [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] easier: [[G2123]] to say [[G2036]] to a paralyzed man, [[G3885]] ‘Your [[G4771]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven,’ [[G863]] or [[G2228]] to say, [[G2036]] ‘Get up, [[G1453]] pick up [[G142]] your [[G4771]] mat, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] walk’? [[G4043]] 
10 But [[G1161]] so that [[G2443]] you may know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] has [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] to forgive [[G863]] sins...” [[G266]] He said [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] paralytic, [[G3885]] 
11 “I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] get up, [[G1453]] pick up [[G142]] your [[G4771]] mat, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] go [[G5217]] home.” [[G3624]] 
12 And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] [the man] got up, [[G1453]] picked up [[G142]] [his] [[G3588]] mat, [[G2895]] [and] walked out [[G1831]] in front of [[G1715]] them all. [[G3956]] As a result, [[G5620]] everyone [[G3956]] was amazed [[G1839]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] saying, [[G3004]] “We have never seen [[G3708]] anything like this!” [[G3779]] 
13 [Once] [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] [Jesus] went out [[G1831]] beside [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]] All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He taught [[G1321]] them [there]. [[G846]] 
14 As He was walking along, [[G3855]] He saw [[G3708]] Levi [[G3018]] [son] [[G3588]] of Alphaeus [[G256]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tax booth. [[G5058]] “Follow [[G190]] Me,” [[G1473]] He told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [Levi] got up [[G450]] [and] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]] 
15 While [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was dining [[G2621]] at [[G1722]] [Levi’s] [[G846]] house, [[G3614]] many [[G4183]] tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners [[G268]] were eating with [[G4873]] [Him] [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples— [[G3101]] for [[G1063]] there were [[G1510]] many [[G4183]] who followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]] 
16 When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] who [were] [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] saw [[G3708]] [Jesus] [[G3754]] eating [[G2068]] with [[G3326]] [these people], [[G5057]] they asked [[G2036]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “Why {does} [[G3754]] He eat [[G2068]] with [[G3326]] tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners?” [[G268]] 
17 [On] [[G2532]] hearing this, [[G191]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “[It is] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] healthy [[G2480]] [who] [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] a doctor, [[G2395]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] sick. [[G2560]] I have not come [[G2064]] to call [[G2564]] the righteous, [[G1342]] but [[G235]] sinners.” [[G268]] 
18 Now [[G2532]] John’s [[G2491]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] were often [[G1510]] fasting. [[G3522]] So [[G2532]] [people] came [[G2064]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] asked, [[G3004]] “Why [[G1223]] don’t [[G3756]] Your [[G4674]] disciples [[G3101]] fast [like] [[G3522]] John’s [[G2491]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] [those] [[G3101]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees? [[G5330]] 
19 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G2036]] “Can [[G1410]] the [[G3588]] guests [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3567]] fast [[G3522]] while [[G3739]] [He] [[G3566]] is [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] them? [[G846]] As long as [[G3745]] [He is] [[G3566]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] they cannot [[G1410]] fast. [[G3522]] 
20 But [[G1161]] the time [[G2250]] will come [[G2064]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] will be taken away [[G522]] from [[G575]] them; [[G846]] then [[G5119]] they will fast. [[G3522]] 
21 No one [[G3762]] sews [[G1976]] a patch [[G1915]] of unshrunk [[G46]] cloth [[G4470]] on [[G1909]] an old [[G3820]] garment. [[G2440]] If he does, [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] [new] piece [[G4138]] will pull away [[G142]] from [[G3588]] [the] old, [[G3820]] and [[G2532]] a worse [[G5501]] tear [[G4978]] will result. [[G1096]] 
22 And [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] pours [[G906]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] into [[G1519]] old [[G3820]] wineskins. [[G779]] If he does, [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] will burst [[G4486]] the [[G3588]] skins, [[G779]] and [both] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wineskins [[G779]] will be ruined. [[G622]] Instead, [[G235]] new [[G3501]] wine [is poured] [[G3631]] into [[G1519]] new [[G2537]] wineskins. [[G779]] 
23 One [[G1722]] Sabbath [[G4521]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was going [[G3899]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] grainfields, [[G4702]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] began [[G756]] to pick [[G5089]] the [[G3588]] heads of grain [[G4719]] [as] they walked along. [[G4160]] 
24 [So] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] said [[G2036]] to Him, [[G846]] “Look, [[G2400]] why [[G5101]] are they doing [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] is unlawful [[G1832]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath?” [[G4521]] 
25 But [[G2532]] [Jesus] replied, [[G3004]] “Have you never read [[G314]] what [[G5101]] David [[G1138]] did [[G4160]] when [[G3753]] he [[G846]] and [[G2532]] his companions [[G3588]] were hungry [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] in need? [[G5532]] 
26 During [[G1909]] the high priesthood [[G749]] of Abiathar, [[G8]] he entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] ate [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] consecrated bread, [[G740]] which [[G3739]] was lawful [[G1832]] only [[G1487]] for the [[G3588]] priests. [[G2409]] And [[G2532]] he gave [some] [[G1325]] to his companions [[G3588]] as well.” [[G2532]] 
27 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “The [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] was made [[G1096]] for [[G1223]] man, [[G444]] not [[G3756]] man [[G444]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath. [[G4521]] 
28 Therefore, [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] is [[G1510]] Lord [[G2962]] even [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] Sabbath.” [[G4521]]
