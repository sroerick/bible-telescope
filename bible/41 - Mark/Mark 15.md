# Mark 15
[[Mark 14|←]] • [[Mark 16|→]]
1 Early [[G2112]] in the morning, [[G4404]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] elders, [[G4245]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] devised [[G4160]] a plan. [[G4824]] They bound [[G1210]] Jesus, [[G2424]] led [Him] away, [[G667]] and [[G2532]] handed [Him] over [[G3860]] to Pilate. [[G4091]] 
2 So [[G2532]] Pilate [[G4091]] questioned [[G1905]] Him, [[G846]] “Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews?” [[G2453]] “You [[G4771]] have said so,” [[G3004]] [Jesus] replied. [[G611]] 
3 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] began to accuse [[G2723]] Him [[G846]] of many things. [[G4183]] 
4 Then [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] questioned [[G1905]] Him [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] “Do You not answer? [[G611]] Look [[G2400]] how many charges [[G4214]] they are bringing against [[G2723]] You!” [[G4771]] 
5 But [[G1161]] to [[G5620]] Pilate’s [[G4091]] amazement, [[G2296]] Jesus [[G2424]] made no further reply. [[G611]] 
6 Now {it was Pilate’s custom} [[G1161]] at [[G2596]] [the] feast [[G1859]] to release [[G630]] to [the people] [[G846]] a [[G1520]] prisoner [[G1198]] of their choosing. [[G3868]] 
7 And [[G1161]] [a man] [[G3588]] named [[G3004]] Barabbas [[G912]] was [[G1510]] imprisoned [[G1210]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] rebels [[G4955]] who [[G3748]] had committed [[G4160]] murder [[G5408]] during [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] insurrection. [[G4714]] 
8 [So] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] went up [[G305]] [and] began [[G756]] asking [Pilate] [[G154]] to keep his custom. [[G2531]] 
9 “Do you want [[G2309]] me to release [[G630]] to you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews?” [[G2453]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked. [[G611]] 
10 For [[G1063]] he knew [it was] [[G1097]] out of [[G1223]] envy [[G5355]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] had handed [Jesus] over. [[G3860]] 
11 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] stirred up [[G383]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] to [[G2443]] have him release [[G630]] Barabbas [[G912]] to them [[G846]] instead. [[G3123]] 
12 [So] [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked [[G611]] them [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] “What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] do you want [[G2309]] me to do [[G4160]] with the [One] [[G3739]] you call [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews?” [[G2453]] 
13 And [[G1161]] they shouted [[G2896]] back, [[G3825]] “Crucify [[G4717]] Him!” [[G846]] 
14 “Why?” [[G1063]] asked [[G2036]] Pilate. [[G4091]] “What [[G5101]] has He done [[G4160]] wrong?” [[G2556]] But [[G1161]] they shouted [[G2896]] all the louder, [[G4057]] “Crucify [[G4717]] Him!” [[G846]] 
15 And [[G1161]] wishing [[G1014]] to [[G4160]] satisfy [[G2425]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] Pilate [[G4091]] released [[G630]] Barabbas [[G912]] to them. [[G846]] But [[G2532]] {he had} Jesus [[G2424]] flogged, [[G5417]] [and] handed Him over [[G3860]] to [[G2443]] be crucified. [[G4717]] 
16 Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] led [Jesus] away [[G520]] into [[G2080]] the [[G3588]] palace [[G833]] (that [[G3739]] is, [[G1510]] [the] Praetorium) [[G4232]] and [[G2532]] called [[G4779]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] company {together}. [[G4686]] 
17 They dressed [[G1737]] Him [[G846]] in a purple robe, [[G4209]] twisted together [[G4120]] a crown [[G4735]] of thorns, [[G174]] [and] set [it] on [[G4060]] His [head]. [[G846]] 
18 And [[G2532]] they began [[G756]] to salute [[G782]] Him: [[G846]] “Hail, [[G5463]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews!” [[G2453]] 
19 They kept striking [[G5180]] His [[G846]] head [[G2776]] with a staff [[G2563]] and [[G2532]] spitting on [[G1716]] Him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] they knelt down [[G5087]] [and] bowed [[G4352]] before Him. [[G846]] 
20 After [[G2532]] they had mocked [[G1702]] Him, [[G846]] they removed [[G1562]] the [[G3588]] purple [robe] [[G4209]] and [[G2532]] put [[G1746]] His [[G846]] own [[G2398]] clothes [back] [[G2440]] on Him. [[G846]] Then [[G2532]] they led Him out [[G1806]] to [[G2443]] crucify [[G4717]] Him. [[G846]] 
21 [Now] [[G5100]] Simon [[G4613]] of Cyrene, [[G2956]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] of Alexander [[G223]] and [[G2532]] Rufus, [[G4504]] was passing by [[G3855]] on his way in [[G2064]] from [[G575]] the country, [[G68]] and [[G2532]] [the soldiers] forced [him] [[G29]] to [[G2443]] carry [[G142]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
22 They brought [[G5342]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to [[G1909]] a place [[G5117]] [called] Golgotha, [[G1115]] which [[G3739]] means [[G3177]] [The] Place [[G5117]] of the Skull. [[G2898]] 
23 There [[G2532]] they offered [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] wine [[G3631]] mixed with myrrh, [[G4669]] but [[G1161]] He [[G3739]] did not take [it]. [[G2983]] 
24 And [[G2532]] they crucified [[G4717]] Him. [[G846]] They also divided [[G1266]] His [[G846]] garments [[G2440]] by casting [[G906]] lots [[G2819]] to decide [[G1909]] what [[G5101]] [each of them] [[G5101]] would take. [[G142]] 
25 It was [[G1510]] [the] third [[G5154]] hour [[G5610]] when [[G2532]] they crucified [[G4717]] Him. [[G846]] 
26 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] charge [[G156]] inscribed [[G1923]] against Him [[G846]] read: [[G1924]] The [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]] 
27 [Along] [[G2532]] with [[G4862]] [Jesus], [[G846]] they crucified [[G4717]] two [[G1417]] robbers, [[G3027]] one [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] [His] right [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] His [[G846]] left. [[G2176]] 
28 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] was fulfilled [[G4137]] that [[G3588]] says, [[G3004]] and [[G2532]] he was reckoned [[G3049]] with [[G3326]] [the] lawless. [[G459]] 
29 Those who [[G3588]] passed by [[G3899]] heaped abuse on [[G987]] Him, [[G846]] shaking [[G2795]] their [[G846]] heads [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] “Aha! [[G3758]] You who are going to destroy [[G2647]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] rebuild [it] [[G3618]] in [[G1722]] three [[G5140]] days, [[G2250]] 
30 come down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] [and] save [[G4982]] Yourself!” [[G4572]] 
31 In the same way, [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G3326]] scribes [[G1122]] mocked [Him] [[G1702]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] saying, [[G2036]] “He [who] saved [[G4982]] others [[G243]] cannot [even] [[G1410]] save [[G4982]] Himself! [[G1438]] 
32 {Let} the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of Israel, [[G2474]] descend [[G2597]] now [[G3568]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] cross, [[G4716]] so that [[G2443]] we may see [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] believe!” [[G4100]] And even [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] were crucified [[G4957]] with [[G4862]] Him [[G846]] berated [[G3679]] Him. [[G846]] 
33 From [the] sixth [[G1623]] hour [[G5610]] until [[G2193]] [the] ninth [[G1766]] hour [[G5610]] darkness [[G4655]] came [[G1096]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] land. [[G1093]] 
34 At the [[G3588]] ninth [[G1766]] hour, [[G5610]] Jesus [[G2424]] cried out [[G994]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] “Eloi, [[G1682]] Eloi, [[G1682]] lema [[G2982]] sabachthani?” [[G4518]] which [[G3739]] means, [[G3177]] “My [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] My [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] why [[G1519]] have You forsaken [[G1459]] Me?” [[G1473]] 
35 When [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] of those [[G3588]] standing nearby [[G3936]] heard [this], [[G191]] they said, [[G2036]] “Look, [[G2400]] He is calling [[G5455]] Elijah.” [[G2243]] 
36 And [[G1161]] someone [[G5100]] ran [[G5143]] and [[G2532]] filled [[G1072]] a sponge [[G4699]] with vinegar. [[G3690]] He put [it] on [[G4060]] a stick [[G2563]] [and] offered it to [Jesus] to drink. [[G4222]] “Wait!” [[G863]] he said. [[G3004]] “Let us see [[G3708]] if [[G1487]] Elijah [[G2243]] comes [[G2064]] to take Him down.” [[G2507]] 
37 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] let out [[G863]] a loud cry [[G5456]] [and] breathed His last. [[G1606]] 
38 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] veil [[G2665]] of the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] was torn [[G4977]] in [[G1519]] two [[G1417]] from [[G575]] top [[G509]] to [[G2193]] bottom. [[G2736]] 
39 When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G2760]] standing there [[G3936]] in front of [[G1727]] [Jesus] [[G846]] saw [[G3708]] [how] [[G3779]] He had breathed His last, [[G1606]] he said, [[G2036]] “Truly [[G230]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] was [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God!” [[G2316]] 
40 And [[G1161]] there were [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] women [[G1135]] watching [[G2334]] from [[G575]] a distance. [[G3113]] Among [[G1722]] them [[G3739]] [were] [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of James [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] younger [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] of Joseph, [[G2500]] and [[G2532]] Salome. [[G4539]] 
41 [These women] [[G3739]] had followed [[G190]] [Jesus] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] ministered [[G1247]] to Him [[G846]] while [[G3753]] He was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and [there were] [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] other [[G243]] [women] who [[G3588]] had come up [[G4872]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] with Him. [[G846]] 
42 Now [[G2532]] it was [[G1096]] already [[G2235]] evening. [[G3798]] Since [[G1893]] it was [[G1510]] Preparation Day [[G3904]] (that [[G3739]] is, [[G1510]] [the day] before the Sabbath), [[G4315]] 
43 Joseph [[G2501]] of [[G575]] Arimathea, [[G707]] [a] prominent [[G2158]] Council member [[G1010]] who [[G3739]] himself [[G846]] was [[G1510]] waiting for [[G4327]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]] boldly [[G5111]] went [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Pilate [[G4091]] to ask for [[G154]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Jesus. [[G2424]] 
44 Pilate [[G4091]] was surprised [to hear] [[G2296]] that [[G1487]] [Jesus] was already dead, [[G2348]] so [[G2532]] he summoned [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G2760]] to ask [[G1905]] if [[G1487]] [this was so]. [[G599]] 
45 When [Pilate] had confirmed [it] [[G1097]] with [[G575]] the [[G3588]] centurion, [[G2760]] he granted [[G1433]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4430]] to Joseph. [[G2501]] 
46 [Joseph] bought [[G59]] a linen cloth, [[G4616]] took down [[G2507]] [the body of Jesus], [[G846]] wrapped [it] in [[G1750]] the [[G3588]] cloth, [[G4616]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] [it] [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a tomb [[G3419]] that [[G3739]] had been [[G1510]] cut [[G2998]] out of [[G1537]] [the] rock. [[G4073]] Then [[G2532]] he rolled [[G4351]] a stone [[G3037]] against [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] entrance [[G2374]] to the [[G3588]] tomb. [[G3419]] 
47 Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] the [mother] [[G3588]] of Joseph [[G2500]] saw [[G2334]] where [[G4225]] [His body] was laid. [[G5087]]
