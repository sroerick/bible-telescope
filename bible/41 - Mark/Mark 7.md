[[Mark 6|←]] • [[Mark 8|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] who had come [[G2064]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] gathered around [[G4863]] [Jesus], [[G846]] 
2 and [[G2532]] they saw [[G3708]] some [[G5100]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] eating [[G2068]] [with] hands [[G5495]] [that were] defiled— [[G2839]] that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] unwashed. [[G449]] 
3 Now [[G1063]] in holding [[G2902]] to the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] of the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] {do} not [[G3756]] eat [[G2068]] until [[G1437]] they wash [[G3538]] [their] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] ceremonially. [[G4435]] 
4 And [[G2532]] [on returning] from [[G575]] the market, [[G58]] they do not eat [[G2068]] unless [[G1437]] they wash. [[G907]] And [[G2532]] there are [[G1510]] many [[G4183]] other [[G243]] traditions for them [[G3880]] to observe, [[G2902]] [including] the washing [[G909]] of cups, [[G4221]] pitchers, [[G3582]] kettles, [[G5473]] and [[G2532]] couches for dining. [[G2825]] 
5 So [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] questioned [[G1905]] [Jesus]: [[G846]] “Why [[G1223]] {do} Your [[G4771]] disciples [[G3101]] not [[G3756]] live [[G4043]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] of the [[G3588]] elders? [[G4245]] Instead, [[G235]] they eat [[G2068]] with defiled [[G2839]] hands. [[G5495]] 
6 Jesus answered [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Isaiah [[G2268]] prophesied [[G4395]] correctly [[G2573]] about [[G4012]] you [[G4771]] hypocrites, [[G5273]] as [[G5613]] it is written: [[G1125]] ‘These [[G3778]] people [[G2992]] honor [[G5091]] Me [[G1473]] with [their] [[G3588]] lips, [[G5491]] but [[G1161]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] are [[G568]] far [[G4206]] from [[G575]] Me. [[G1473]] 
7 They worship [[G4576]] Me [[G1473]] in vain; [[G3155]] they teach [[G1321]] [as] doctrine [[G1319]] [the] precepts [[G1778]] of men.’ [[G444]] 
8 You have disregarded [[G863]] the [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] of God [[G2316]] to keep [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] of men.” [[G444]] 
9 He went on to say, [[G2036]] “You neatly set aside [[G114]] the [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] of God [[G2316]] to [[G2443]] maintain [[G5083]] your [[G4771]] [own] [[G3588]] tradition. [[G3862]] 
10 For [[G1063]] Moses [[G3475]] said, [[G2036]] ‘Honor [[G5091]] your [[G4771]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] mother,’ [[G3384]] and, [[G2532]] ‘Whoever [[G3588]] curses [[G2551]] [his] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother [[G3384]] must be put to death.’ [[G5053]] 
11 But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] say that [[G3004]] if [[G1437]] a man [[G444]] says [[G2036]] to [his] [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother, [[G3384]] ‘Whatever [[G3739]] you would have received [[G5623]] from [[G1537]] me [[G1473]] [is] Corban’ [[G2878]] (that [[G3739]] is, [[G1510]] a gift committed to God), [[G1435]] 
12 he [is] [[G846]] no longer [[G3765]] permitted [[G863]] to do [[G4160]] anything [[G3762]] for his [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother. [[G3384]] 
13 [Thus] you nullify [[G208]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] by [[G3588]] [the] [[G4771]] tradition [[G3862]] you have handed down. [[G3860]] And [[G2532]] you do [[G4160]] so [[G5108]] in many [[G4183]] such [matters].” [[G3946]] 
14 Once again [[G3825]] [Jesus] called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] crowd [to Him] [[G3793]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “All of you, [[G3956]] listen to [[G191]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] understand: [[G4920]] 
15 Nothing [[G3762]] that enters [[G1531]] a [[G3588]] man [[G444]] from the outside [[G1855]] can [[G1410]] defile [[G2840]] him; [[G846]] but [[G235]] the things [[G3588]] that come [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] a [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] these are [[G1510]] what [[G3588]] defile [[G2840]] [him].” [[G444]] 
16 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5101]] has [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear. [[G191]] 
17 After [[G3753]] [Jesus] had left [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] [and gone] into [[G1519]] [the] house, [[G3624]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] inquired about [[G1905]] the [[G3588]] parable. [[G3850]] 
18 “Are [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] still [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] dull?” [[G801]] He asked. [[G3004]] “Do you not understand? [[G3539]] Nothing [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] enters [[G1531]] a [[G3588]] man [[G444]] from the outside [[G1855]] can [[G1410]] defile [[G2840]] him, [[G846]] 
19 because [[G3754]] it does not enter [[G1531]] his [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] but [[G235]] [it goes] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] stomach [[G2836]] and then [[G2532]] is eliminated.” [[G1607]] ([Thus] all [[G3956]] foods [[G1033]] are clean.) [[G2511]] 
20 He continued: [[G2036]] “What [[G3588]] comes [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] a [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] that [is what] [[G1565]] defiles [[G2840]] [him]. [[G444]] 
21 For [[G1063]] from [[G1537]] within [[G2081]] the [[G3588]] hearts [[G2588]] of men [[G444]] come [[G1607]] evil [[G2556]] thoughts, [[G1261]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] theft, [[G2829]] murder, [[G5408]] adultery, [[G3430]] 
22 greed, [[G4124]] wickedness, [[G4189]] deceit, [[G1388]] debauchery, [[G766]] envy, [[G3788]] slander, [[G988]] arrogance, [[G5243]] [and] foolishness. [[G877]] 
23 All [[G3956]] these [[G3778]] evils [[G4190]] come [[G1607]] from within, [[G2081]] and [[G2532]] [these are what] defile [[G2840]] a [[G3588]] man.” [[G444]] 
24 [Jesus] left [[G450]] that place [[G1564]] [and] went [[G565]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] region [[G3725]] of Tyre. [[G5184]] Not wanting anyone [[G2309]] to know [He was there], [[G1097]] He entered [[G1525]] [a] house, [[G3614]] but [[G2532]] was unable [[G1410]] to escape their notice. [[G2990]] 
25 Instead, [[G235]] a woman [[G1135]] whose [[G3739]] little daughter [[G2365]] had [[G2192]] [an] unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] soon [[G2112]] heard [[G191]] about [[G4012]] Jesus, [[G846]] [and] she came [[G2064]] [and] fell [[G4363]] at [[G4314]] His [[G846]] feet. [[G4228]] 
26 Now [[G1161]] she was [[G1510]] a Greek [[G1674]] woman [[G1135]] of [[G3588]] Syrophoenician [[G4949]] origin, [[G1085]] and [[G2532]] she kept asking [[G2065]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to drive [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] demon [[G1140]] out of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] daughter. [[G2364]] 
27 “First [[G4412]] let [[G863]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] have their fill,” [[G5526]] He said. [[G2036]] “For [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] right [[G2570]] to take [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] children’s [[G5043]] bread [[G740]] and [[G2532]] toss [it] [[G906]] to the [[G3588]] dogs.” [[G2952]] 
28 “Yes, [[G3483]] Lord,” [[G2962]] she replied, [[G611]] “even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dogs [[G2952]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] table [[G5132]] eat [[G2068]] the [[G3588]] children’s [[G3813]] crumbs.” [[G5589]] 
29 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] her, [[G846]] “Because of [[G1223]] this [[G3778]] answer, [[G3056]] you may go. [[G5217]] The [[G3588]] demon [[G1140]] has left [[G1831]] your [[G4771]] daughter.” [[G2364]] 
30 And [[G2532]] she went [[G565]] home [[G3624]] [and] found [[G2147]] [her] [[G3588]] child [[G3813]] lying [[G906]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] bed, [[G2825]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] demon [[G1140]] was gone. [[G1831]] 
31 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] left [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] region [[G3725]] of Tyre [[G5184]] [and] went [[G2064]] through [[G1223]] Sidon [[G4605]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Sea [[G2281]] of Galilee [[G1056]] [and] into [[G303]] the [[G3588]] region [[G3725]] of [the] Decapolis. [[G1179]] 
32 [Some people] brought [[G5342]] to Him [[G846]] a man who was deaf [[G2974]] and [[G2532]] hardly able to speak, [[G3424]] and [[G2532]] they begged [[G3870]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to place [[G2007]] [His] [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] on him. [[G846]] 
33 [So] [[G2532]] [Jesus] took him [[G618]] aside [[G2596]] privately, [[G2398]] away from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] [and] put [[G906]] His [[G846]] fingers [[G1147]] into [[G1519]] [the man’s] [[G846]] ears. [[G3775]] Then [[G2532]] He spit [[G4429]] [and] touched [[G680]] [the man’s] [[G846]] tongue. [[G1100]] 
34 And [[G2532]] looking up [[G308]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] He sighed deeply [[G4727]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] to him, [[G846]] “Ephphatha!” [[G2188]] (which [[G3739]] means, [[G1510]] “Be opened!”). [[G1272]] 
35 Immediately [[G2112]] [the man’s] [[G846]] ears [[G189]] were opened [[G455]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] tongue [[G1100]] was released, [[G3089]] and [[G2532]] he began to speak [[G2980]] plainly. [[G3723]] 
36 [Jesus] ordered [[G1291]] them [[G846]] not to tell anyone. [[G3004]] But [[G1161]] the more [[G3745]] He [[G846]] ordered [[G1291]] them, [[G846]] the more widely [[G4053]] they proclaimed [it]. [[G2784]] 
37 [The people] were utterly astonished [[G1605]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “He has done [[G4160]] all things [[G3956]] well! [[G2573]] He makes [[G4160]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] deaf [[G2974]] to hear [[G191]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mute [[G216]] to speak!” [[G2980]]
