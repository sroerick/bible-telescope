1 Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Passover [[G3957]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] [Feast of] Unleavened Bread [[G106]] were [[G1510]] two [[G1417]] days [[G2250]] away, [[G3326]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] were looking for [[G2212]] [a] covert [[G1388]] way [[G4459]] to arrest [[G2902]] [Jesus] [[G846]] [and] kill [Him]. [[G615]] 
2 “[But] not [[G3361]] during [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast,” [[G1859]] they said, [[G2036]] “or [[G3361]] there may be [[G1510]] a riot [[G2351]] among the [[G3588]] people.” [[G2992]] 
3 While [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Bethany [[G963]] reclining at the table [[G2621]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] home [[G3614]] of Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] leper, [[G3015]] a woman [[G1135]] came [[G2064]] [with] [[G2192]] an alabaster jar [[G211]] of expensive [[G4185]] perfume, [[G3464]] made of pure [[G4101]] nard. [[G3487]] She broke open [[G4937]] the [[G3588]] jar [[G211]] [and] poured [it] on [[G2708]] [Jesus] [[G846]] head. [[G2776]] 
4 But [[G1161]] some [of] [[G5100]] those present [[G1510]] expressed their indignation [[G23]] to [[G4314]] one another: [[G1438]] “Why [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] waste [[G684]] of [[G3588]] perfume? [[G3464]] 
5 [It] [[G3464]] could [[G1410]] have been sold [[G4097]] for over [[G1883]] three hundred [[G5145]] denarii [[G1220]] and [[G2532]] [the money] given [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] poor.” [[G4434]] And [[G2532]] they scolded [[G1690]] her. [[G846]] 
6 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “Leave her alone; [[G863]] why [[G5101]] are you bothering [[G3930]] her? [[G846]] She has done [[G2038]] a beautiful [[G2570]] deed [[G2041]] to [[G1722]] Me. [[G1473]] 
7 The [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] you will always have [[G2192]] with [[G3326]] you, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] you can [[G1410]] help [[G2095]] them [[G846]] whenever [[G3752]] you want. [[G2309]] But [[G1161]] {you will} not [[G3756]] always [[G3842]] have [[G2192]] Me. [[G1473]] 
8 She has done [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] she could [[G2192]] to anoint [[G3462]] My [[G1473]] body [[G4983]] in advance [[G4301]] of [[G1519]] [My] [[G3588]] burial. [[G1780]] 
9 And [[G1161]] truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] wherever [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] is preached [[G2784]] in [[G1519]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] what [[G3739]] [she] [[G3778]] has done [[G4160]] will also be told [[G2980]] in [[G1519]] memory [[G3422]] of her.” [[G846]] 
10 Then [[G2532]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] Twelve, [[G1427]] went [[G565]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] to [[G2443]] betray [[G3860]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to them. [[G846]] 
11 They were delighted [[G5463]] to hear [this], [[G191]] and [[G2532]] they promised [[G1861]] to give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] money. [[G694]] So [[G2532]] [Judas] began to look for [[G2212]] an opportunity [[G2122]] to hand Him over. [[G3860]] 
12 On the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] day [[G2250]] of the Feast of Unleavened [Bread], [[G106]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] Passover lamb [[G3957]] was to be sacrificed, [[G2380]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G3004]] Him, [[G846]] “Where [[G4226]] do You want [[G2309]] us to prepare [[G2090]] for [[G2443]] You to eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] Passover?” [[G3957]] 
13 So [[G2532]] He sent [[G649]] two [[G1417]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Go [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] a man [[G444]] carrying [[G941]] a pitcher [[G2765]] of water [[G5204]] will meet [[G528]] you. [[G4771]] Follow [[G190]] him, [[G846]] 
14 and [[G2532]] whichever {house} [[G3699]] he enters, [[G1525]] say [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] owner, [[G3617]] ‘The [[G3588]] Teacher [[G1320]] asks: [[G3004]] Where [[G4226]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] guest room, [[G2646]] where [[G3699]] I may eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] Passover [[G3957]] with [[G3326]] My [[G1473]] disciples?’ [[G3101]] 
15 And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] will show [[G1166]] you [[G4771]] a large [[G3173]] upper room, [[G508]] furnished [[G4766]] [and] ready. [[G2092]] Make preparations [[G2090]] for us [[G1473]] there.” [[G1563]] 
16 So [[G2532]] the disciples [[G3101]] left [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] [where] [[G2532]] they found [[G2147]] [everything] as [[G2531]] [Jesus] had described. [[G2036]] And [[G2532]] they prepared [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] Passover. [[G3957]] 
17 When [[G2532]] evening [[G3798]] came, [[G1096]] [Jesus] arrived [[G2064]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Twelve. [[G1427]] 
18 And while [[G2532]] they [[G846]] were reclining [[G345]] and [[G2532]] eating, [[G2068]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] is eating [[G2068]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] will betray [[G3860]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
19 They began [[G756]] to be sorrowful [[G3076]] and [[G2532]] to ask [[G3004]] Him [[G846]] one [[G1520]] by [[G2596]] one, [[G1520]] “Surely not [[G3385]] I?” [[G1473]] 
20 He answered [[G2036]] “[It is] one of [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] Twelve— [[G1427]] the [one who] [[G3588]] is dipping [ his bread ] [[G1686]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] bowl [[G5165]] with [[G3326]] Me. [[G1473]] 
21 The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will go [[G5217]] just as [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] about [[G4012]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] to that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] [He] [[G3588]] is betrayed! [[G3860]] [It would be] better [[G2570]] for him [[G846]] if [[G1487]] [he] [[G444]] had not been born. [[G1080]] 
22 While they were eating, [[G2068]] [Jesus] took [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] spoke a blessing [[G2127]] [and] broke it, [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] gave [it] [[G1325]] to them, [[G846]] saying, [[G2036]] “Take [it]; [[G2983]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] body.” [[G4983]] 
23 Then [[G2532]] He took [[G2983]] the cup, [[G4221]] gave thanks, [[G2168]] [and] gave it [[G1325]] to them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they all drank [[G4095]] from [[G1537]] it. [[G846]] 
24 He said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] covenant, [[G1242]] which [[G3588]] is poured out [[G1632]] for [[G5228]] many. [[G4183]] 
25 Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] I will no longer drink [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] [this] [[G3588]] fruit [[G1081]] of the [[G3588]] vine [[G288]] until [[G2193]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] when [[G3752]] I drink [[G4095]] it [[G846]] anew [[G2537]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God.” [[G2316]] 
26 And [[G2532]] when they had sung a hymn, [[G5214]] they went out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of Olives. [[G1636]] 
27 Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “You will all fall away, [[G4624]] for [[G3754]] it is written: [[G1125]] ‘I will strike [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] shepherd, [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] will be scattered.’ [[G1287]] 
28 But [[G235]] after [[G3326]] I have risen, [[G1453]] I [[G1473]] will go ahead of [[G4254]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1519]] Galilee.” [[G1056]] 
29 Peter [[G4074]] declared, [[G5346]] “Even [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] all [[G3956]] fall away, [[G4624]] I [[G1473]] never [will].” [[G3756]] 
30 “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you,” [[G4771]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G3004]] “this [[G3778]] very [[G4594]] night [[G3571]] before [[G4250]] [the] rooster [[G220]] crows [[G5455]] twice, [[G1364]] you will deny [[G533]] Me [[G1473]] three times.” [[G5151]] 
31 But [[G1161]] [Peter] kept insisting, [[G2980]] “Even if [[G1437]] I have [[G1163]] to die with [[G4880]] You, [[G4771]] I will never deny [[G533]] You.” [[G4771]] And [[G1161]] all the others [[G3956]] said [[G2036]] the same. [[G5615]] 
32 Then [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] a place [[G5564]] called [[G3686]] Gethsemane, [[G1068]] and [[G2532]] [Jesus] told [[G3004]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “Sit [[G2523]] here [[G5602]] while [[G2193]] I pray.” [[G4336]] 
33 He took [[G3880]] with [[G3326]] Him [[G846]] Peter, [[G4074]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to be deeply troubled [[G1568]] and [[G2532]] distressed. [[G85]] 
34 And [[G2532]] He told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “My [[G1473]] soul [[G5590]] is [[G1510]] consumed with sorrow [[G4036]] to the point of [[G2193]] death. [[G2288]] Stay [[G3306]] here [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] keep watch.” [[G1127]] 
35 Going a little farther, [[G4281]] He fell [[G4098]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] prayed [[G4336]] that, [[G2443]] if [[G1487]] it were [[G1510]] possible, [[G1415]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] would pass [[G3928]] from [[G575]] Him. [[G846]] 
36 “Abba, [[G5]] Father,” [[G3962]] He said, [[G2036]] “all things [are] [[G3956]] possible [[G1415]] for You. [[G4771]] Take [[G3911]] this [[G3778]] cup [[G4221]] from [[G575]] Me. [[G1473]] Yet [[G235]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] I [[G1473]] will, [[G2309]] but [[G235]] what [[G5101]] You [will].” [[G4771]] 
37 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] returned [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] sleeping. [[G2518]] “Simon, [[G4613]] are you asleep?” [[G2518]] He asked, [[G3004]] “Were you not able [[G2480]] to keep watch [[G1127]] for one [[G1520]] hour? [[G5610]] 
38 Watch [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] pray [[G4336]] so that [[G2443]] you will not enter [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] temptation. [[G3986]] For [[G3303]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] [is] willing, [[G4289]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4561]] [is] weak.” [[G772]] 
39 Again [[G3825]] He went away [[G565]] [and] prayed, [[G4336]] saying [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] thing. [[G3056]] 
40 And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] He returned [[G2064]] [and] found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] sleeping, [[G2518]] for [[G1063]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were [[G1510]] heavy. [[G2599]] And [[G2532]] they did not know [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] to answer [[G611]] Him. [[G846]] 
41 [When] [[G2532]] [Jesus] returned [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] third time, [[G5154]] He said, [[G3004]] “Are you still sleeping [[G2518]] and [[G2532]] resting? [[G373]] That is enough! [[G568]] The [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] has come. [[G2064]] Look, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] is betrayed [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] of sinners. [[G268]] 
42 Rise, [[G1453]] let us go. [[G71]] See, [[G2400]] My betrayer [[G3860]] is approaching!” [[G1448]] 
43 While [[G2112]] [Jesus] was still speaking, [[G2980]] Judas, [[G2455]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] Twelve, [[G1427]] arrived, [[G3854]] [accompanied by] [[G3326]] a crowd [[G3793]] [armed] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] clubs, [[G3586]] sent from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] elders. [[G4245]] 
44 Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] betrayer [[G3860]] had arranged [[G1325]] a signal [[G4953]] with them: [[G846]] “The One [[G3739]] I kiss [[G5368]] is [[G1510]] [the man]; [[G846]] arrest [[G2902]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] lead [Him] away [[G520]] securely.” [[G806]] 
45 Going [[G4334]] directly [[G2112]] to [Jesus], [[G846]] he said, [[G3004]] “Rabbi!” [[G4461]] and [[G2532]] kissed [[G2705]] Him. [[G846]] 
46 Then [[G1161]] [the men] seized [[G1911]] [Jesus] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] arrested [[G2902]] Him. [[G846]] 
47 And [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] bystanders [[G3936]] drew [[G4685]] [his] [[G3588]] sword [[G3162]] [and] struck [[G3817]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] of the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] cutting off [[G851]] his [[G846]] ear. [[G5621]] 
48 Jesus [[G2424]] asked [[G2036]] [the crowd], [[G846]] “Have you come out [[G1831]] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] clubs [[G3586]] to arrest [[G4815]] Me [[G1473]] as [[G5613]] [you would] [[G1909]] an outlaw? [[G3027]] 
49 Every [[G2596]] day [[G2250]] I was [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] you did not arrest [[G2902]] Me. [[G1473]] But [[G235]] [this has happened] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures [[G1124]] would be fulfilled.” [[G4137]] 
50 Then [[G2532]] all [His disciples] [[G3956]] deserted [[G863]] Him [[G846]] [and] fled. [[G5343]] 
51 One [[G5100]] young man [[G3495]] who had been following [[G4870]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was wearing [[G4016]] a linen cloth [[G4616]] around [[G1909]] [his body]. [[G1131]] They caught hold [[G2902]] of him, [[G846]] 
52 but [[G1161]] he pulled free [[G2641]] of the [[G3588]] linen cloth [[G4616]] and ran away [[G5343]] naked. [[G1131]] 
53 They led [[G520]] Jesus {away} [[G2424]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] elders, [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] assembled. [[G4905]] 
54 Peter [[G4074]] followed [[G190]] Him [[G846]] at [[G575]] a distance, [[G3113]] right [[G2193]] into [[G2080]] the [[G3588]] courtyard [[G833]] of the [[G3588]] high priest. [[G749]] And [[G2532]] he sat [[G4775]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] to warm himself [[G2328]] by [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] fire. [[G5457]] 
55 Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] were seeking [[G2212]] testimony [[G3141]] against [[G2596]] Jesus [[G2424]] to [[G1519]] put Him to death, [[G2289]] but [[G2532]] they did not find [any]. [[G2147]] 
56 For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] bore false witness [[G5576]] against [[G2596]] [Jesus], [[G846]] but [[G2532]] their [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] was [[G1510]] inconsistent. [[G2470]] 
57 Then [[G2532]] some [men] [[G5100]] stood up [[G450]] [and] testified falsely [[G5576]] against [[G2596]] Him: [[G846]] 
58 “We [[G1473]] heard [[G191]] Him [[G846]] say, [[G3004]] ‘I [[G1473]] will destroy [[G2647]] this [[G3778]] man-made [[G5499]] temple, [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1223]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] I will build [[G3618]] another [that is] [[G243]] made without hands.’” [[G886]] 
59 But even [[G2532]] their [[G846]] testimony [[G3141]] was [[G1510]] inconsistent. [[G2470]] 
60 [So] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] stood up [[G450]] before them [[G3319]] [and] questioned [[G1905]] Jesus, [[G2424]] “Have You no answer? [[G611]] What [is it] [[G5101]] these [men] [[G3778]] are testifying against [[G2649]] You?” [[G4771]] 
61 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] remained silent [[G4623]] and [[G2532]] made no reply. [[G611]] Again [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] questioned [[G1905]] Him, [[G846]] “Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] Blessed [One]?” [[G2128]] 
62 “I [[G1473]] am,” [[G1510]] said [[G2036]] Jesus, [[G2424]] “and [[G2532]] you will see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G1537]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of [[G3588]] Power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] coming [[G2064]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] clouds [[G3507]] of [[G3588]] heaven.” [[G3772]] 
63 At this, [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] tore [[G1284]] his [[G846]] clothes [[G5509]] [and] declared, [[G3004]] “Why [[G5101]] do we need [[G5532]] any more [[G2089]] witnesses? [[G3144]] 
64 You have heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] blasphemy. [[G988]] What [[G5101]] is your [[G4771]] verdict?” [[G5316]] And [[G1161]] they all [[G3956]] condemned [[G2632]] Him [[G846]] as [[G1510]] deserving [[G1777]] of death. [[G2288]] 
65 Then [[G2532]] some [of them] [[G5100]] began [[G756]] to spit on [[G1716]] Him. [[G846]] They blindfolded Him, [[G4028]] struck Him with their fists, [[G2852]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] to Him, [[G846]] “Prophesy!” [[G4395]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] received [[G2983]] Him [[G846]] with slaps in His face. [[G4475]] 
66 While [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] courtyard [[G833]] below, [[G2736]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] high priest’s [[G749]] servant girls [[G3814]] came down [[G2064]] 
67 and [[G2532]] saw [[G3708]] [him] [[G4074]] warming himself [there]. [[G2328]] She looked at [[G1689]] [Peter] [[G846]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “You [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] were [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] Nazarene.” [[G3479]] 
68 But [[G1161]] he denied [it]. [[G720]] “I do not know [[G1492]] or even [[G3777]] understand [[G1987]] what [[G5101]] you [[G4771]] are talking about,” [[G3004]] he said. [[G3004]] Then [[G2532]] he went [[G1831]] out [[G1854]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] gateway, [[G4259]] and [[G2532]] the rooster [[G220]] crowed. [[G5455]] 
69 [There] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] servant girl [[G3814]] saw [[G3708]] him [[G846]] [and] [[G756]] again [[G3825]] said to [[G3004]] those [[G3588]] standing nearby, [[G3936]] “This [man] [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] [one] of [[G1537]] them.” [[G846]] 
70 But [[G1161]] he denied [it] [[G720]] again. [[G3825]] After [[G3326]] a little while, [[G3398]] those [[G3588]] standing nearby [[G3936]] said [[G2036]] once more [[G3825]] to Peter, [[G4074]] “Surely [[G230]] you are [[G1510]] one of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] for [[G1063]] you too are [[G1510]] a Galilean.” [[G1057]] 
71 But [[G1161]] he began [[G756]] to curse [[G332]] and [[G2532]] swear, [[G3660]] “I do not know [[G1492]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] of whom [[G3739]] you speak!” [[G3004]] 
72 And [[G2532]] just then, [[G2112]] [the] rooster [[G220]] crowed [[G5455]] a second time. [[G1208]] Then [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] remembered [[G363]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] Jesus [[G2424]] had spoken [[G2036]] to him: [[G846]] “Before [[G4250]] [the] rooster [[G220]] crows [[G5455]] twice, [[G1364]] you will deny [[G533]] Me [[G1473]] three times.” [[G5151]] And [[G2532]] he broke down [[G1911]] [and] wept. [[G2799]]
