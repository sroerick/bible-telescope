# Mark 13
[[Mark 12|←]] • [[Mark 14|→]]
1 As [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was leaving [[G1607]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] one [[G1520]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] said [[G3004]] to Him, [[G846]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] look at [[G2400]] [the magnificent] [[G4217]] stones [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] buildings!” [[G3619]] 
2 “Do you see [[G991]] [all] these [[G3778]] great [[G3173]] buildings?” [[G3619]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G2036]] “Not [one] [[G3756]] stone [[G3037]] here [[G5602]] will be left [[G863]] on [[G1909]] [another]; [[G3037]] [every one] [[G3739]] will be toppled.” [[G2647]] 
3 While [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was sitting [[G2521]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of Olives [[G1636]] opposite [[G2713]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] Peter, [[G4074]] James, [[G2385]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] Andrew [[G406]] asked [[G1905]] Him [[G846]] privately, [[G2398]] 
4 “Tell [[G2036]] us, [[G1473]] when {will} [[G4219]] all these things [[G3778]] happen? [[G1510]] And [[G2532]] what [will be] [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] that [[G3752]] [they] [[G3778]] are about [[G3195]] to be fulfilled?” [[G4931]] 
5 Jesus [[G2424]] began [[G756]] by telling [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “See to it [[G991]] [that] [[G3361]] [no one] [[G5100]] deceives [[G4105]] you. [[G4771]] 
6 Many [[G4183]] will come [[G2064]] in [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] claiming, [[G3004]] ‘I [[G1473]] am [He],’ [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] will deceive [[G4105]] many. [[G4183]] 
7 When [[G3752]] you hear of [[G191]] wars [[G4171]] and [[G2532]] rumors [[G189]] of wars, [[G4171]] {do} not [[G3361]] be alarmed. [[G2360]] [ These things ] must [[G1163]] happen, [[G1096]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] [is] still to come. [[G3768]] 
8 Nation [[G1484]] will rise [[G1453]] against [[G1909]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] kingdom [[G932]] against [[G1909]] kingdom. [[G932]] There will be [[G1510]] earthquakes [[G4578]] in various [[G2596]] places, [[G5117]] [as well as] [[G1510]] famines. [[G3042]] These [are] [[G3778]] [the] beginning [[G746]] of birth pains. [[G5604]] 
9 [So] [[G1161]] be on your guard. [[G991]] You [[G4771]] will be handed over [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] [the] councils [[G4892]] and [[G2532]] beaten [[G1194]] in [[G1519]] [the] synagogues. [[G4864]] On My account, [[G1752]] you will stand [[G2476]] before [[G1909]] governors [[G2232]] and [[G2532]] kings [[G935]] as [[G1519]] witnesses [[G3142]] to them. [[G846]] 
10 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] must [[G1163]] first [[G4412]] be proclaimed [[G2784]] to [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] nations. [[G1484]] 
11 But [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] they arrest [[G71]] you [[G4771]] [and] hand [you] over, [[G3860]] {do} not [[G3361]] worry beforehand [[G4305]] what [[G5101]] to say. [[G2980]] Instead, [[G235]] speak [[G2980]] whatever [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] are given [[G1325]] at [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time, [[G5610]] for [[G1063]] it will not be [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] speaking, [[G2980]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
12 Brother [[G80]] will betray [[G3860]] brother [[G80]] to [[G1519]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] a father [[G3962]] [his] child. [[G5043]] Children [[G5043]] will rise [[G1881]] against [[G1909]] [their] parents [[G1118]] and [[G2532]] have them put to death. [[G2289]] 
13 You will be [[G1510]] hated [[G3404]] by [[G5259]] everyone [[G3956]] on account of [[G1223]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] but [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] perseveres [[G5278]] to [[G1519]] [the] end [[G5056]] will be saved. [[G4982]] 
14 So [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] you see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] abomination [[G946]] of [[G3588]] desolation [[G2050]] standing [[G2476]] where [[G3699]] it should not be [[G1163]] ({let} the [[G3588]] reader [[G314]] understand), [[G3539]] then {let} [[G5119]] those who are [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Judea [[G2449]] flee [[G5343]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountains. [[G3735]] 
15 {Let} [[G1161]] [no one] [[G3588]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetop [[G1430]] go back inside [[G2597]] to retrieve [[G142]] anything [[G5100]] from [[G1537]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3614]] 
16 And {let} [[G2532]] [no one] [[G3588]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] field [[G68]] return for [[G1994]] his [[G846]] cloak. [[G2440]] 
17 [How] [[G1161]] miserable [[G3759]] those [[G1565]] days [will be] [[G2250]] for [[G3588]] pregnant [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] nursing [mothers]! [[G2337]] 
18 Pray [[G4336]] that [[G2443]] it will not occur [[G1096]] in the winter. [[G5494]] 
19 For [[G1063]] [in] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] there will be [[G1510]] tribulation [[G2347]] unmatched [[G5108]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning [[G746]] of God’s creation [[G2937]] until [[G2193]] now, [[G3568]] and [[G2532]] never [[G3756]] to be seen again. [[G1096]] 
20 If [[G1487]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] had not shortened [[G2856]] those [[G3588]] days, [[G2250]] nobody [[G3756]] would be saved. [[G4982]] But [[G235]] for the sake of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] elect, [[G1588]] whom [[G3739]] He has chosen, [[G1586]] He has shortened [[G2856]] [them]. [[G2250]] 
21 At that time [[G5119]] if [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] says [[G2036]] to you, [[G4771]] ‘Look, [[G2400]] here [is] [[G5602]] the [[G3588]] Christ!’ [[G5547]] [or] ‘There [[G1563]] [He is]!’ [[G2400]] do not believe [it]. [[G4100]] 
22 For [[G1063]] false Christs [[G5580]] and [[G2532]] false prophets [[G5578]] will appear [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] perform [[G1325]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] that [[G4314]] would deceive [[G635]] [even] the [[G3588]] elect, [[G1588]] if [that were] [[G1487]] possible. [[G1415]] 
23 [So] [[G1161]] be on your guard; [[G991]] I have told [[G4302]] you [[G4771]] everything {in advance}. [[G3956]] 
24 However, [[G235]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] tribulation [[G2347]] of [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] ‘The [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] will be darkened, [[G4654]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] moon [[G4582]] will not give [[G1325]] its [[G846]] light, [[G5338]] 
25 the [[G3588]] stars [[G792]] will [[G1510]] fall [[G4098]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] sky, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] powers [[G1411]] of [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] will be shaken.’ [[G4531]] 
26 Then [[G5119]] they will see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] coming [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [the] clouds [[G3507]] with [[G3326]] great [[G4183]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] glory. [[G1391]] 
27 And [[G2532]] He will send out [[G649]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] to gather [[G1996]] His [[G846]] elect [[G1588]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] winds, [[G417]] from [[G575]] [the] ends [[G206]] of [the] earth [[G1093]] to [[G2193]] [the] ends [[G206]] of heaven. [[G3772]] 
28 Now [[G1161]] learn [[G3129]] this [[G3588]] lesson [[G3850]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fig tree: [[G4808]] As soon as [[G3752]] its [[G846]] branches [[G2798]] become [[G1096]] tender [[G527]] and [[G2532]] sprout [[G1631]] leaves, [[G5444]] you know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] summer [[G2330]] is [[G1510]] near. [[G1451]] 
29 In the same way, [[G3779]] when [[G3752]] you see [[G3708]] these things [[G3778]] happening, [[G1096]] you [[G4771]] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] He is [[G1510]] near, [[G1451]] right at [[G1909]] [the] door. [[G2374]] 
30 Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] will not pass away [[G3928]] until [[G3360]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G3778]] have happened. [[G1096]] 
31 Heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] will pass away, [[G3928]] but [[G1161]] My [[G1473]] words [[G3056]] will never pass away. [[G3928]] 
32 But [[G1161]] as for [[G4012]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] or [[G2228]] hour, [[G5610]] no one [[G3762]] knows, [[G1492]] not even [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] nor [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] but only [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] 
33 Be on your guard [[G991]] [and] stay alert! [[G69]] For [[G1063]] you do not know [[G1492]] when [[G4219]] the [[G3588]] appointed time [[G2540]] will come. [[G1510]] 
34 [It is] like [[G5613]] a man [[G444]] going on a journey [[G590]] [who] left [[G863]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3614]] put [[G1325]] each [[G1538]] servant [[G1401]] in charge [[G1849]] of his [own] [[G846]] task, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] instructed [[G1781]] the [[G3588]] doorkeeper [[G2377]] to [[G2443]] keep watch. [[G1127]] 
35 Therefore [[G3767]] keep watch, [[G1127]] because [[G1063]] you do not know [[G1492]] when [[G4219]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] will return— [[G2064]] whether [[G2228]] in the evening, [[G3796]] at midnight, [[G3317]] when the rooster crows, [[G219]] or [[G2228]] in the morning. [[G4404]] 
36 Otherwise, [[G3361]] he may arrive [[G2064]] without notice [[G1810]] [and] find [[G2147]] you [[G4771]] sleeping. [[G2518]] 
37 And [[G1161]] what [[G3739]] I say [[G3004]] to you, [[G4771]] I say [[G3004]] to everyone: [[G3956]] Keep watch!” [[G1127]]
