[[Mark 11|←]] • [[Mark 13|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] began [[G756]] to speak [[G2980]] to them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] parables: [[G3850]] “A man [[G444]] planted [[G5452]] a vineyard. [[G290]] He put [[G4060]] a wall {around it}, [[G5418]] dug [[G3736]] a wine vat, [[G5276]] and [[G2532]] built [[G3618]] a watchtower. [[G4444]] Then [[G2532]] he rented it out [[G1554]] to [some] tenants [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] went away on a journey. [[G589]] 
2 At harvest time, [[G2540]] he sent [[G649]] a servant [[G1401]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] tenants [[G1092]] to [[G2443]] collect [[G2983]] [his share] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] of the [[G3588]] vineyard. [[G290]] 
3 But [[G2532]] they seized [[G2983]] [the servant], [[G846]] beat [him], [[G1194]] and [[G2532]] sent [him] away [[G649]] empty-handed. [[G2756]] 
4 Then [[G2532]] he sent [[G649]] them [[G846]] another [[G243]] servant, [[G1401]] and [[G2548]] they struck {him} over the head [[G2775]] and [[G2532]] treated [him] shamefully. [[G818]] 
5 He sent [[G649]] still another, [[G243]] and this one [[G2548]] they killed. [[G615]] [He sent] [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] others; [[G243]] some [[G3739]] they beat [[G1194]] and [[G1161]] [others] [[G3739]] they killed. [[G615]] 
6 Finally, [[G2078]] having [[G2192]] one [[G1520]] beloved [[G27]] son, [[G5207]] he sent [[G649]] him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] them. [[G846]] ‘They will respect [[G1788]] my [[G1473]] son,’ [[G5207]] he said. [[G3004]] 
7 But [[G1161]] [the] [[G1565]] tenants [[G1092]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] one another, [[G1438]] ‘This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] heir; [[G2818]] come, [[G1205]] let us kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] inheritance [[G2817]] will be [[G1510]] ours.’ [[G1473]] 
8 So [[G2532]] they seized [the son], [[G2983]] killed [[G615]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] threw [[G1544]] him [[G846]] out [[G1854]] of the [[G3588]] vineyard. [[G290]] 
9 What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] {will} the [[G3588]] owner [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] do? [[G4160]] He will come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] kill [[G622]] [those] [[G3588]] tenants [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] to others. [[G243]] 
10 Have you never read [[G314]] this [[G3778]] Scripture: [[G1124]] ‘[The] stone [[G3037]] the [[G3588]] builders [[G3618]] rejected [[G593]] has become [[G1096]] the [[G1519]] cornerstone. [[G1137]] 
11 This [[G3778]] is [[G1096]] from [[G3844]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] it is [[G1510]] marvelous [[G2298]] in [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] eyes’?” [[G3788]] 
12 At this, [[G2532]] [the leaders] sought [[G2212]] to arrest [[G2902]] [Jesus], [[G846]] for [[G1063]] they knew [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] He had spoken [[G2036]] [this] [[G3588]] parable [[G3850]] against [[G4314]] them. [[G846]] But [[G2532]] fearing [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] they left [[G863]] Him [[G846]] [and] went away. [[G565]] 
13 Later, [[G2532]] they sent [[G649]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] Herodians [[G2265]] to [[G2443]] catch [[G64]] [Jesus] [[G846]] in [His] words. [[G3056]] 
14 “Teacher,” [[G1320]] they said, [[G3004]] “we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] You are [[G1510]] honest [[G227]] and [[G2532]] are swayed [[G3199]] by no one. [[G3762]] Indeed, [[G1063]] You are impartial [[G991]] [and] [[G235]] teach [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of God [[G2316]] in accordance with [[G1909]] [the] truth. [[G225]] [ Now then, ] is it lawful [[G1832]] to pay [[G1325]] taxes [[G2778]] to Caesar [[G2541]] or [[G2228]] not? [[G3756]] Should we pay [them] [[G1325]] or [[G2228]] not?” [[G3361]] 
15 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] saw through [[G1492]] their [[G846]] hypocrisy [[G5272]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Why [[G5101]] are you testing [[G3985]] Me? [[G1473]] Bring [[G5342]] Me [[G1473]] a denarius [[G1220]] to [[G2443]] inspect.” [[G3708]] 
16 [So] [[G1161]] they brought [it], [[G5342]] and [[G2532]] He asked [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Whose [[G5101]] likeness [[G1504]] [is] this? [[G3778]] And [[G2532]] [whose] [[G3588]] inscription?” [[G1923]] “Caesar’s,” [[G2541]] they answered. [[G2036]] 
17 Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Give [[G591]] to Caesar [[G2541]] what is [[G3588]] Caesar’s, [[G2541]] and [[G2532]] to God [[G2316]] what is [[G3588]] God’s.” [[G2316]] And [[G2532]] they marveled [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]] 
18 Then [[G2532]] [some] Sadducees, [[G4523]] who [[G3748]] say [[G3004]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3361]] resurrection, [[G386]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] questioned [[G1905]] Him: [[G846]] 
19 “Teacher, [[G1320]] Moses [[G3475]] wrote [[G1125]] for us [[G1473]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] a man’s [[G5100]] brother [[G80]] dies [[G599]] and [[G2532]] leaves [[G2641]] a wife [[G1135]] but [[G2532]] no [[G3361]] children, [[G5043]] [the man] [[G80]] should marry [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] widow [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] raise up [[G1817]] offspring [[G4690]] for [[G3588]] his [[G846]] brother. [[G80]] 
20 [Now] there were [[G1510]] seven [[G2033]] brothers. [[G80]] The [[G3588]] first [one] [[G4413]] married [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] died, [[G599]] leaving [[G863]] no [[G3756]] children. [[G4690]] 
21 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [one] [[G1208]] married [[G2983]] [the widow], [[G846]] [but] he also died [[G2532]] [and] left [[G2641]] no [[G3361]] children. [[G4690]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [did] [[G5154]] likewise. [[G5615]] 
22 In this way, [[G2532]] none [[G3756]] of the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] left [[G863]] [any] children. [[G4690]] And [[G2532]] last [[G2078]] of all, [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] died. [[G599]] 
23 In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection, [[G386]] whose [[G5101]] wife [[G1135]] will she be? [[G1510]] For [[G1063]] [all] [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] were [[G2192]] married [[G1135]] to her.” [[G846]] 
24 Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G5346]] to them, [[G846]] “Aren’t you mistaken [[G4105]] because [[G1223]] you do not know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures [[G1124]] [or] [[G3366]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of God? [[G2316]] 
25 When [[G3752]] the dead rise, [[G450]] they will neither marry [[G1060]] nor [[G3777]] be given in marriage. [[G1061]] Instead, [[G235]] they will be [[G1510]] like [[G5613]] [the] angels [[G32]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
26 And [[G1161]] regarding [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] rising, [[G1453]] have you not read [[G314]] about [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] [burning] bush [[G942]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] book [[G976]] of Moses, [[G3475]] how [[G4459]] God [[G2316]] told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] ‘I [am] [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Jacob? [[G2384]] 
27 He is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] [the] God [[G2316]] of [the] dead, [[G3498]] but [[G235]] of [the] living. [[G2198]] You are badly mistaken!” [[G4105]] 
28 Now [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] had come up [[G4334]] and heard [[G191]] their [[G846]] debate. [[G4802]] Noticing [[G3708]] how well [[G2573]] [Jesus] had answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] he asked [[G1905]] Him, [[G846]] “Which [[G4169]] commandment [[G1785]] is [[G1510]] [the] most important [[G4413]] of all?” [[G3956]] 
29 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “This is [[G1510]] the [[G3754]] most important: [[G4413]] ‘Hear [[G191]] O Israel, [[G2474]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] One [[G1520]] Lord, [[G2962]] 
30 and [[G2532]] you shall love [[G25]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] God [[G2316]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] heart [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] soul [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] mind [[G1271]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] strength. [[G2479]] 
31 [The] second [[G1208]] [is] this: [[G3778]] ‘Love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] neighbor [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] yourself.’ [[G4572]] No [[G3756]] other [[G243]] commandment [[G1785]] is [[G1510]] greater [[G3173]] than these.” [[G3778]] 
32 “Right, [[G2573]] Teacher,” [[G1320]] the [[G3588]] scribe [[G1122]] replied. [[G2036]] “You have stated [[G2036]] correctly [[G225]] that [[G3754]] [God] is [[G1510]] One [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] other [[G243]] but [[G4133]] Him, [[G846]] 
33 and [[G2532]] to love [[G25]] Him [[G846]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] [your] [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] [your] [[G3588]] understanding [[G4907]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] [your] [[G3588]] strength, [[G2479]] and [[G2532]] to love [[G25]] [your] [[G3588]] neighbor [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] yourself, [[G1438]] which is [[G1510]] more important [[G4053]] than all [[G3956]] burnt offerings [[G3646]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices. [[G2378]] 
34 When [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] [the man] had answered [[G611]] wisely, [[G3562]] He said, [[G2036]] “You are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] far [[G3112]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God.” [[G2316]] And [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] dared [[G5111]] to question [[G1905]] Him [[G846]] [any] further. [[G3765]] 
35 While [[G2532]] [Jesus] was teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] [He] [[G2424]] asked, [[G2036]] “How [[G4459]] {can} the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] is [[G1510]] [the] son [[G5207]] of David? [[G1138]] 
36 Speaking by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] David [[G1138]] himself [[G846]] declared: [[G2036]] ‘[The] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] Lord, [[G2962]] “Sit [[G2521]] at [[G1537]] My [[G1473]] right hand [[G1188]] until [[G2193]] I put [[G5087]] Your [[G4771]] enemies [[G2190]] under [[G5270]] Your [[G4771]] feet. [[G4228]] 
37 David [[G1138]] himself [[G846]] calls [[G3004]] Him [[G846]] Lord. [[G2962]] So [[G2532]] how [[G4159]] can He be [[G1510]] [David’s] [[G846]] son?” [[G5207]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] listened [[G191]] to Him [[G846]] with delight. [[G2234]] 
38 In [[G1722]] His [[G846]] teaching [[G1322]] [Jesus] also said, [[G2036]] “Watch out [[G991]] for [[G575]] the [[G3588]] scribes. [[G1122]] They like [[G2309]] to walk around [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] long robes, [[G4749]] [to receive] greetings [[G783]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplaces, [[G58]] 
39 and [to have] [[G2532]] the chief seats [[G4410]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] [the] places of honor [[G4411]] at [[G1722]] banquets. [[G1173]] 
40 They [[G3588]] defraud [[G2719]] widows [[G5503]] [of their] [[G3588]] houses, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] for a show [[G4392]] make lengthy prayers. [[G4336]] These [men] [[G3778]] will receive [[G2983]] greater [[G4053]] condemnation.” [[G2917]] 
41 As [[G2532]] [Jesus] was sitting [[G2523]] opposite [[G2713]] the [[G3588]] treasury, [[G1049]] He watched [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] placing [[G906]] money [[G5475]] into [[G1519]] [it]. [[G1049]] And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] rich [people] [[G4145]] put in [[G906]] large amounts. [[G4183]] 
42 Then [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] poor [[G4434]] widow [[G5503]] came [[G2064]] [and] put [in] [[G906]] two [[G1417]] small copper coins, [[G3016]] which [[G3739]] amounted to [[G1510]] a small fraction of a denarius. [[G2835]] 
43 [Jesus] called [[G4341]] His [[G846]] disciples {to Him} [[G3101]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] this [[G3778]] poor [[G4434]] widow [[G5503]] has put [[G906]] more [[G4119]] than all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] [others] [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] treasury. [[G1049]] 
44 For [[G1063]] they all [[G3956]] contributed [[G906]] out of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] surplus, [[G4052]] but [[G1161]] she [[G3778]] out of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] poverty [[G5304]] has put [in] [[G906]] all [[G3956]] she had [[G2192]] to live on.” [[G979]]
