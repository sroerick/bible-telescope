[[Mark 3|←]] • [[Mark 5|→]]
1 [Once] [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] [Jesus] began [[G756]] to teach [[G1321]] beside [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] [such] a large [[G4118]] crowd [[G3793]] gathered [[G4863]] around [[G4314]] Him [[G846]] that [[G5620]] He [[G846]] got into [[G1684]] a boat [[G4143]] [and] sat [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] [it]. [[G2281]] All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] crowded [[G1510]] along [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] shore, [[G1093]] 
2 and [[G2532]] He taught [[G1321]] them [[G846]] many things [[G4183]] in [[G1722]] parables. [[G3850]] And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] teaching [[G1322]] He said, [[G2036]] 
3 “Listen! [[G191]] A [[G3588]] farmer [[G4687]] went out [[G1831]] to sow his seed. [[G4687]] 
4 As [[G1722]] he was sowing, [[G4687]] some [seed] [[G3739]] fell [[G4098]] along [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] path, [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G4071]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] devoured [[G2719]] it. [[G846]] 
5 Other [ seed ] [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] rocky ground, [[G4075]] where [[G3699]] it did not have [[G2192]] much [[G4183]] soil. [[G1093]] It sprang up [[G1816]] quickly, [[G2112]] because [[G1223]] the soil [[G1093]] was shallow. [[G3361]] 
6 But [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] rose, [[G393]] [the seedlings] were scorched, [[G2739]] and [[G2532]] they withered [[G3583]] because [[G1223]] they had [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] root. [[G4491]] 
7 Other [ seed ] [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] among [[G1519]] thorns, [[G173]] [which] [[G173]] grew up [[G305]] and [[G2532]] choked [[G4846]] [the seedlings], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [they] yielded [[G1325]] no [[G3756]] crop. [[G2590]] 
8 Still [[G2532]] other [seed] [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1519]] good [[G2570]] soil, [[G1093]] [where it] sprouted, [[G305]] grew up, [[G837]] and [[G2532]] produced [[G1325]] a crop— [[G2590]] one [[G1520]] bearing [[G5342]] thirtyfold, [[G5144]] another [[G1520]] sixtyfold, [[G1835]] and [[G2532]] another [[G1520]] a hundredfold.” [[G1540]] 
9 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] said, [[G2036]] “He who [[G3739]] has [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear.” [[G191]] 
10 As soon as [[G2532]] [Jesus] was [[G1096]] alone [[G3441]] [with] the [[G3588]] Twelve [[G1427]] and [[G4862]] those [[G3588]] around [[G4012]] Him, [[G846]] they asked [[G2065]] Him [[G846]] [about] the [[G3588]] parable. [[G3850]] 
11 And [[G2532]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “The [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] has been given [[G1325]] to you, [[G4771]] but [[G1161]] to those [[G1565]] on the outside, [[G1854]] everything [[G3956]] is expressed [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] parables, [[G3850]] 
12 so that, [[G2443]] ‘they may be ever seeing [[G991]] [but] [[G2532]] never [[G3361]] perceiving, [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] ever hearing [[G191]] [but] [[G2532]] never [[G3361]] understanding; [[G4920]] otherwise [[G3361]] they might turn [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] be forgiven.’” [[G863]] 
13 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “Do you not understand [[G1492]] this [[G3778]] parable? [[G3850]] Then [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] will you understand [[G1097]] [any of] [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] parables? [[G3850]] 
14 The [[G3588]] farmer [[G4687]] sows [[G4687]] the [[G3588]] word. [[G3056]] 
15 [Some] [[G3778]] are like [[G1510]] the [seeds] [[G3588]] along [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] path, [[G3598]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] is sown. [[G4687]] As soon as [[G2112]] they hear [it], [[G191]] Satan [[G4567]] comes [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] takes away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that [[G3588]] was sown [[G4687]] in [[G1519]] them. [[G846]] 
16 [Others] [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] like [[G3668]] the [seeds] [[G3588]] sown [[G4687]] on [[G1909]] rocky places. [[G4075]] [They] [[G3739]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] [and] at once [[G2112]] receive [[G2983]] it [[G846]] with [[G3326]] joy. [[G5479]] 
17 But [[G2532]] they themselves have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] root, [[G4491]] [and] [[G235]] they remain [[G1510]] for only a season. [[G4340]] When [[G1534]] trouble [[G2347]] or [[G2228]] persecution [[G1375]] comes [[G1096]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] they quickly fall away. [[G4624]] 
18 Still [[G2532]] [others] [[G243]] are like [[G1510]] the [seeds] [[G3588]] sown [[G4687]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] thorns. [[G173]] [They] [[G3778]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] 
19 but [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cares [[G3308]] of this life, [[G165]] the [[G3588]] deceitfulness [[G539]] of [[G3588]] wealth, [[G4149]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] desire [[G1939]] for [[G4012]] other things [[G3062]] come in [[G1531]] [and] choke [[G4846]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] it becomes [[G1096]] unfruitful. [[G175]] 
20 Yet [[G2532]] [others] [[G1565]] are like [[G1510]] the [seeds] [[G3588]] sown [[G4687]] on [[G1909]] good [[G2570]] soil. [[G1093]] [They] [[G3748]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] receive [it], [[G3858]] and [[G2532]] produce a crop— [[G2592]] thirtyfold, [[G5144]] sixtyfold, [[G1835]] [or] [[G2532]] a [[G1520]] hundredfold.” [[G1540]] 
21 [Jesus] also said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Does [anyone] bring in [[G2064]] a [[G3588]] lamp [[G3088]] so [[G2443]] he can place [it] [[G5087]] under [[G5259]] a basket [[G3426]] or [[G2228]] under [[G5259]] a bed? [[G2825]] Doesn’t he [[G3756]] set it [[G5087]] on [[G1909]] a lampstand? [[G3087]] 
22 For [[G1063]] [everything] [[G3756]] hidden [[G2927]] is [[G1510]] meant [[G1437]] to [[G2443]] be revealed, [[G5319]] [and everything] [[G3761]] concealed [[G1096]] is meant [[G235]] to be brought [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] light. [[G5318]] 
23 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] has [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear.” [[G191]] 
24 He went on to say, [[G2036]] “Pay attention to [[G991]] what [[G5101]] you hear. [[G191]] With [[G1722]] [the] [[G3739]] measure [[G3358]] you [use], [[G3354]] it will be measured [[G3354]] to you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] even more will be added [[G4369]] to you. [[G4771]] 
25 For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3739]] has [[G2192]] will be given [[G1325]] [more], [[G846]] [but] [[G2532]] whoever [[G3739]] does not have, [[G2192]] even [[G2532]] what [[G3739]] he has [[G2192]] will be taken away [[G142]] from [[G575]] him.” [[G846]] 
26 [Jesus] also said, [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3779]] a man [[G444]] who scatters [[G906]] seed [[G4703]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]] 
27 Night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] he sleeps [[G2518]] and [[G2532]] wakes, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seed [[G4703]] sprouts [[G985]] and [[G2532]] grows, [[G3373]] [though] he [[G846]] knows [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] how. [[G5613]] 
28 All by itself [[G844]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] produces a crop— [[G2592]] first [[G4412]] [the] stalk, [[G5528]] then [[G1534]] [the] head, [[G4719]] then [[G1534]] grain [[G4621]] [that] ripens [[G4134]] within. [[G1722]] 
29 And [[G1161]] as soon as [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] grain [[G2590]] is ripe, [[G3860]] he swings [[G649]] the [[G3588]] sickle, [[G1407]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] harvest [[G2326]] has come.” [[G3936]] 
30 Then [[G2532]] He asked, [[G2036]] “To what [[G4459]] can we compare [[G3666]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God? [[G2316]] With [[G1722]] what [[G5101]] parable [[G3850]] shall we present [[G5087]] it? [[G846]] 
31 It is like [[G5613]] a mustard seed, [[G2848]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] smallest [[G3398]] of all [[G3956]] seeds [[G4690]] sown [[G4687]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] 
32 But [[G2532]] after [[G3752]] it is planted, [[G4687]] it grows [[G305]] to be [[G1096]] larger [[G3173]] than all [[G3956]] garden plants [[G3001]] and [[G2532]] puts forth [[G4160]] great [[G3173]] branches, [[G2798]] so that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G4071]] of the [[G3588]] air [[G3772]] nest [[G2681]] in [[G5259]] its [[G846]] shade. [[G4639]] 
33 With many such [[G4183]] parables [[G3850]] [Jesus] spoke [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] to them, [[G846]] to the extent that [[G2531]] they could [[G1410]] understand. [[G191]] 
34 He did not say [anything] [[G2980]] to them [[G846]] without [[G5565]] a parable. [[G3850]] But [[G1161]] privately [[G2398]] He explained [[G1956]] all things [[G3956]] to His [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] disciples. [[G3101]] 
35 When [[G2532]] that [[G1565]] evening came, [[G3798]] He said [[G3004]] to [His disciples], [[G846]] “Let us go across [[G1330]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side.” [[G4008]] 
36 After [[G2532]] they had dismissed [[G863]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] they took [Jesus] with them, [[G3880]] since [[G5613]] He was already [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] boat. [[G4143]] And [[G2532]] there were [[G1510]] other [[G243]] boats [[G4143]] with [[G3326]] Him. [[G846]] 
37 Soon [[G2532]] a violent [[G3173]] windstorm [[G2978]] came up, [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] waves [[G2949]] were breaking [[G1911]] over [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] so that [[G5620]] [it] [[G4143]] was being swamped. [[G1072]] 
38 But [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] stern, [[G4403]] sleeping [[G2518]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cushion. [[G4344]] [So] [[G2532]] they woke [[G1453]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] don’t You care [[G3199]] that [[G3754]] we are perishing?” [[G622]] 
39 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] got up [[G1326]] [and] rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]] “Silence!” [[G4623]] He commanded. [[G2036]] “Be still!” [[G5392]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] died down, [[G2869]] and [[G2532]] it was [[G1096]] perfectly [[G3173]] calm. [[G1055]] 
40 “Why [[G5101]] are you [[G1510]] so afraid?” [[G1169]] He asked. [[G2036]] “Do you still have no [[G2192]] faith?” [[G4102]] 
41 Overwhelmed with fear, [[G5399]] they asked [[G2036]] one another, [[G240]] “Who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] this, [[G3778]] that [[G3754]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] obey [[G5219]] Him?” [[G846]]
