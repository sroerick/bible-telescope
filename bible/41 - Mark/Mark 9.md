1 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] there are [[G1510]] some [[G5100]] standing [[G2476]] here [[G5602]] who [[G3748]] will not taste [[G1089]] death [[G2288]] until [[G2193]] they see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] arrive [[G2064]] with [[G1722]] power. [[G1411]] 
2 After [[G3326]] six [[G1803]] days, [[G2250]] Jesus [[G2424]] took with [Him] [[G3880]] Peter, [[G4074]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] led them up [[G399]] a high [[G5308]] mountain [[G3735]] [by] themselves. [[G2398]] [There] [[G2532]] He was transfigured [[G3339]] before [[G1715]] them. [[G846]] 
3 His [[G846]] clothes [[G2440]] became [[G1096]] radiantly [[G3029]] white, [[G3022]] [brighter than] [[G3634]] [any] [[G3756]] launderer [[G1102]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] could [[G1410]] bleach them. [[G3021]] 
4 And [[G2532]] Elijah [[G2243]] [and] [[G4862]] Moses [[G3475]] appeared [[G3708]] before them, [[G846]] talking with [[G4814]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
5 Peter [[G4074]] said [[G3004]] to Jesus, [[G2424]] “Rabbi, [[G4461]] it is [[G1510]] good [[G2570]] for us [[G1473]] to be [[G1510]] here. [[G5602]] Let us put up [[G4160]] three [[G5140]] shelters: [[G4633]] one [[G1520]] for You, [[G4771]] one [[G1520]] for Moses, [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] for Elijah.” [[G2243]] 
6 For [[G1063]] they were all [[G1096]] so terrified [[G1630]] that [[G1063]] [Peter] did not know [[G1492]] what else [[G5101]] to say. [[G611]] 
7 Then [[G2532]] a cloud [[G3507]] appeared [[G1096]] [and] enveloped [[G1982]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] came [[G1096]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] cloud: [[G3507]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] Son. [[G5207]] Listen [[G191]] to Him!” [[G846]] 
8 Suddenly, [[G1819]] [when] they looked around, [[G4017]] they saw [[G3708]] no [[G3765]] one [[G3762]] with [[G3326]] them [[G1438]] except [[G235]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
9 [As] [[G2532]] they [[G846]] were coming down [[G2597]] the [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] [Jesus] admonished [[G1291]] them [[G846]] not to tell anyone [[G1334]] what [[G3739]] they had seen [[G3708]] until [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] had risen [[G450]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]] 
10 [So] [[G2532]] they kept [[G2902]] this [[G3588]] matter [[G3056]] to [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] discussing [[G4802]] what [[G5101]] it meant [[G1510]] to rise [[G450]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]] 
11 And [[G2532]] they asked [[G1905]] [Jesus], [[G846]] “{Why do} the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] Elijah [[G2243]] must [[G1163]] come [[G2064]] first?” [[G4412]] 
12 He replied, [[G5346]] “Elijah [[G2243]] {does} indeed [[G3303]] come [[G2064]] first, [[G4412]] [and] he restores [[G600]] all things. [[G3956]] Why [[G4459]] then [[G2532]] is it written [[G1125]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] must suffer [[G3958]] many things [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] be rejected? [[G1847]] 
13 But [[G235]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] Elijah [[G2243]] has indeed come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] they have done [[G4160]] to him [[G846]] whatever [[G3745]] they wished, [[G2309]] just as [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] about [[G1909]] him.” [[G846]] 
14 [When] [[G2532]] they returned [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] [other] disciples, [[G3101]] they saw [[G3708]] a large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] around [[G4012]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] arguing [[G4802]] with [[G4314]] them. [[G846]] 
15 As soon as [[G2112]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] saw [[G3708]] [Jesus], [[G846]] they were filled with awe [[G1568]] and [[G2532]] ran [[G4370]] to greet [[G782]] Him. [[G846]] 
16 “What [[G5101]] are you disputing [[G4802]] with [[G4314]] them?” [[G848]] He asked. [[G1905]] 
17 Someone [[G1520]] in [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] replied, [[G611]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] I brought [[G5342]] You [[G4771]] my [[G1473]] son, [[G5207]] who has [[G2192]] a spirit [[G4151]] [that makes him] mute. [[G216]] 
18 Whenever [[G3699]] it seizes [[G2638]] him, [[G846]] it throws him to the ground. [[G4486]] He foams at the mouth, [[G875]] gnashes [[G5149]] his teeth, [[G3599]] and [[G2532]] becomes rigid. [[G3583]] I asked [[G2036]] Your [[G4771]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G2443]] drive it out, [[G1544]] but [[G2532]] they were unable.” [[G2480]] 
19 “O [[G5599]] unbelieving [[G571]] generation!” [[G1074]] [Jesus] [[G3004]] replied. [[G611]] “How long [[G2193]] must I remain [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] you? [[G4771]] How long [[G2193]] must I put up with [[G430]] you? [[G4771]] Bring [[G5342]] [the boy] [[G846]] to [[G4314]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
20 So [[G2532]] they brought [[G5342]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] seeing [[G3708]] [Jesus], [[G846]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] immediately [[G2112]] threw [the boy] into a convulsion. [[G4952]] He fell [[G4098]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1093]] [and] rolled around, [[G2947]] foaming at the mouth. [[G875]] 
21 [Jesus] asked [[G1905]] [the boy’s] [[G846]] father, [[G3962]] “How long [[G4214]] {has} this [[G3778]] been [[G1096]] with him?” [[G846]] “From [[G1537]] childhood,” [[G3812]] he said. [[G2036]] 
22 “It often throws [[G906]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] [the] fire [[G4442]] [or] [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] [the] water, [[G5204]] trying [[G2443]] to kill [[G622]] him. [[G846]] But [[G235]] if [[G1487]] You can [do] [[G1410]] anything, [[G5100]] have compassion [[G4697]] on [[G1909]] us [[G1473]] [and] help [[G997]] us.” [[G1473]] 
23 “If [[G1487]] You can?” [[G1410]] echoed [[G2036]] Jesus. [[G2424]] “All things [[G3956]] are possible [[G1415]] to him who [[G3588]] believes!” [[G4100]] 
24 Immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] boy’s [[G3813]] father [[G3962]] cried out, [[G2896]] “I do believe; [[G4100]] help [[G997]] my [[G1473]] unbelief!” [[G570]] 
25 When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] a crowd [[G3793]] had come running, [[G1998]] He rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit. [[G4151]] “[You] deaf [[G2974]] and [[G2532]] mute [[G216]] spirit,” [[G4151]] He said, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] command [[G2004]] you [[G4771]] to come [[G1831]] out [[G1537]] and [[G2532]] never [[G3371]] enter [[G1525]] him {again}.” [[G846]] 
26 After shrieking [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] convulsing him violently, [[G4682]] [the spirit] came out. [[G1831]] [The boy] became [[G1096]] like [[G5616]] a corpse, [[G3498]] so that [[G5620]] many [[G4183]] said, [[G3004]] “He is dead.” [[G599]] 
27 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] took [[G2902]] him [[G846]] by the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] [and] helped him to his feet, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] he stood up. [[G450]] 
28 After [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] had gone [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] [the] house, [[G3624]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G1905]] Him [[G846]] privately, [[G2398]] “Why [[G3754]] couldn’t [[G1410]] we [[G1473]] drive it out?” [[G1544]] 
29 [Jesus] answered, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] kind [[G1085]] cannot [[G1410]] come out, [[G1831]] except [[G1487]] by [[G1722]] prayer.” [[G4335]] 
30 Going on [[G1831]] from there, [[G2547]] they passed [[G3899]] through [[G1223]] Galilee. [[G1056]] But [[G2532]] [Jesus] did not want [[G2309]] anyone [[G5100]] to know, [[G1097]] 
31 because [[G1063]] He was teaching [[G1321]] His [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be delivered [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] [the] hands [[G5495]] of men. [[G444]] They will kill [[G615]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] He will rise.” [[G450]] 
32 But [[G1161]] they did not understand [[G50]] this [[G3588]] statement, [[G4487]] and [[G2532]] they were afraid [[G5399]] to ask [[G1905]] Him. [[G846]] 
33 Then [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum. [[G2584]] While [Jesus] was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] He asked [[G1905]] them, [[G846]] “What [[G5101]] were you discussing [[G1260]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way?” [[G3598]] 
34 But [[G1161]] they were silent, [[G4623]] for [[G1063]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] they had been arguing [[G1256]] with [[G4314]] each other [[G240]] which [of them was] [[G5101]] [the] greatest. [[G3173]] 
35 Sitting down, [[G2523]] [Jesus] called [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] Twelve [[G1427]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] “If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] wants [[G2309]] to be [[G1510]] first, [[G4413]] he must be [[G1510]] [the] last [[G2078]] of all [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] [the] servant [[G1249]] of all.” [[G3956]] 
36 Then [[G2532]] He had [[G2476]] a little child {stand} [[G3813]] among [[G3319]] them. [[G846]] Taking [the child] in His arms, [[G1723]] He said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] 
37 “Whoever [[G3739]] welcomes [[G1209]] one [[G1520]] of these [[G5108]] little children [[G3813]] in [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] name [[G3686]] welcomes [[G1209]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3739]] welcomes [[G1209]] Me [[G1473]] welcomes [[G1209]] not only [[G3756]] Me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] the [One] [[G3588]] who sent [[G649]] Me. [[G1473]] 
38 John [[G2491]] said [[G5346]] to Him, [[G846]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] we saw [[G3708]] someone [[G5100]] else [[G3739]] driving out [[G1544]] demons [[G1140]] in [[G1722]] Your [[G4771]] name, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] we tried to stop [[G2967]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] he does not accompany [[G190]] us.” [[G1473]] 
39 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G2036]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] stop [[G2967]] him. [[G846]] No one [[G3762]] who [[G3739]] performs [[G4160]] a miracle [[G1411]] in [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] name [[G3686]] can [[G1410]] turn around [[G5035]] and [[G2532]] speak evil of [[G2551]] Me. [[G1473]] 
40 For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] against [[G2596]] us [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] for [[G5228]] us. [[G1473]] 
41 Indeed, [[G1063]] if anyone [[G3739]] gives [[G4222]] you [[G4771]] [even] a cup [[G4221]] of water [[G5204]] because [[G3754]] you bear [[G1510]] the name [[G3686]] of Christ, [[G5547]] truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] he will never lose [[G622]] his [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]] 
42 Whoever [[G3739]] causes [[G4624]] one [[G1520]] of these [[G3778]] little ones [[G3398]] who [[G3588]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me {to stumble}, [[G1473]] it would be [[G1510]] better [[G2570]] for him [[G846]] to have [[G1487]] a large [[G3684]] millstone [[G3458]] hung [[G4029]] around [[G4012]] his [[G846]] neck [[G5137]] and [[G2532]] to be thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]] 
43 If [[G1437]] your [[G4771]] hand [[G5495]] causes you to fall into sin, [[G4624]] cut it off. [[G609]] It is [[G1510]] better [[G2570]] for you [[G4771]] to enter [[G1525]] life [[G2222]] crippled [[G2948]] than [[G2228]] to have [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] hands [[G5495]] [and] go [[G565]] into [[G1519]] hell, [[G1067]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] unquenchable [[G762]] fire. [[G4442]] 
44 where [[G3699]] their [[G846]] worm [[G4663]] {does} not [[G3756]] die, [[G5053]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] is not quenched. [[G4570]] 
45 If [[G1437]] your [[G4771]] foot [[G4228]] causes you to fall into sin, [[G4624]] cut it off. [[G609]] It is [[G1510]] better [[G2570]] for you [[G4771]] to enter [[G1525]] life [[G2222]] lame [[G5560]] than [[G2228]] to have [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] feet [[G4228]] [and] be thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] hell. [[G1067]] 
46 where [[G3699]] their [[G846]] worm [[G4663]] {does} not [[G3756]] die, [[G5053]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] is not quenched. [[G4570]] 
47 And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] your [[G4771]] eye [[G3788]] causes you to fall into sin, [[G4624]] pluck it out. [[G1544]] It is [[G1510]] better [[G2570]] for you [[G4771]] to enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] with one eye [[G3442]] than [[G2228]] to have [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] eyes [[G3788]] [and] be thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] hell, [[G1067]] 
48 where [[G3699]] ‘their [[G846]] worm [[G4663]] never [[G3756]] dies, [[G5053]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] is never quenched.’ [[G4570]] 
49 For [[G1063]] everyone [[G3956]] will be salted [[G233]] with fire. [[G4442]] 
50 Salt [is] [[G217]] good, [[G2570]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] [it] [[G217]] loses its saltiness, [[G358]] with [[G1722]] what [[G5101]] will you season [[G741]] it? [[G846]] Have [[G2192]] salt [[G217]] among [[G1722]] yourselves, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] be at peace [[G1514]] with [[G1722]] one another.” [[G240]]
