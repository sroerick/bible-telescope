[[Mark 10|←]] • [[Mark 12|→]]
1 As [[G3753]] they approached [[G1448]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] [and came] to [[G1519]] Bethphage [[G967]] and [[G2532]] Bethany [[G963]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of Olives, [[G1636]] [Jesus] sent [[G649]] two [[G1417]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] 
2 and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “Go [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] village [[G2968]] ahead of [[G2713]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] as soon [[G2112]] as you enter [[G1531]] it, [[G846]] you will find [[G2147]] a colt [[G4454]] tied [there], [[G1210]] on [[G1909]] which [[G3739]] no one [[G3762]] has ever sat. [[G2523]] Untie [[G3089]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] bring [it to Me]. [[G5342]] 
3 If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] asks, [[G2036]] ‘Why [[G5101]] are you doing [[G4160]] this?’ [[G3778]] tell [him], [[G2036]] ‘The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] needs [[G5532]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] will return [[G649]] it [[G846]] shortly.’” [[G2112]] 
4 [So] [[G2532]] they went [[G565]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] [the] colt [[G4454]] outside [[G1854]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] street, [[G296]] tied [[G1210]] at [[G4314]] a doorway. [[G2374]] They untied [[G3089]] it, [[G846]] 
5 and [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] who were [[G3588]] standing [[G2476]] there [[G1563]] asked, [[G2036]] “Why [[G5101]] are you [[G4160]] untying [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] colt?” [[G4454]] 
6 [The disciples] answered [[G2036]] as [[G2531]] Jesus [[G2424]] had instructed [them], [[G2036]] and [[G2532]] [the people] gave them permission. [[G863]] 
7 They led [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] colt [[G4454]] to [[G4314]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] threw [[G1911]] their [[G846]] cloaks [[G2440]] over it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He sat [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] it. [[G846]] 
8 Many [ in the crowd ] [[G4183]] spread [[G4766]] their [[G846]] cloaks [[G2440]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] road, [[G3598]] while [[G1161]] others [spread] [[G243]] branches [[G4746]] they had cut [[G2875]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] fields. [[G68]] 
9 The [ones who] [[G3588]] went ahead [[G4254]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] followed [[G190]] were shouting: [[G2896]] “Hosanna!” [[G5614]] “Blessed is [[G2127]] He [who] [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord!” [[G2962]] 
10 “Blessed [[G2127]] [is] the [[G3588]] coming [[G2064]] kingdom [[G932]] of our [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] David!” [[G1138]] “Hosanna [[G5614]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] highest!” [[G5310]] 
11 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] entered [[G1525]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] [and went] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple courts. [[G2411]] He looked around at [[G4017]] everything, [[G3956]] [but since] [[G3588]] [it] [[G5610]] was [[G1510]] already [[G2235]] late, [[G3796]] He went out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] Bethany [[G963]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Twelve. [[G1427]] 
12 The [[G3588]] next day, [[G1887]] [when] they [[G846]] had left [[G1831]] Bethany, [[G963]] [Jesus] was hungry. [[G3983]] 
13 Seeing [[G3708]] in [[G575]] the distance [[G3113]] a fig tree [[G4808]] in [[G2192]] leaf, [[G5444]] He went [[G2064]] to see [[G2147]] if [[G1487]] there was [[G687]] any [fruit] [[G5100]] on [[G1722]] it. [[G846]] But when [[G2532]] He reached [[G2064]] it, [[G846]] He found [[G2147]] nothing [on it] [[G3762]] except [[G1487]] leaves, [[G5444]] since [[G1063]] it was [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] season [[G2540]] for figs. [[G4810]] 
14 Then [[G2532]] He said [[G2036]] to [the tree], [[G846]] “{May} no one [[G3367]] ever [[G3371]] eat [[G5315]] of [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] fruit {again}.” [[G2590]] And [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [this statement]. [[G191]] 
15 When [[G2532]] they arrived [[G2064]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] [Jesus] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] [and] began [[G756]] to drive out [[G1544]] those who [[G3588]] were buying [[G59]] and [[G2532]] selling [[G4453]] [there]. [[G2411]] He overturned [[G2690]] the [[G3588]] tables [[G5132]] of the [[G3588]] money changers [[G2855]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seats [[G2515]] of those [[G3588]] selling [[G4453]] doves. [[G4058]] 
16 And [[G2532]] He would not allow [[G863]] anyone [[G5100]] to carry [[G1308]] merchandise [[G4632]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] temple courts. [[G2411]] 
17 Then [[G2532]] He began to teach [[G1321]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] declare, [[G2036]] “Is it not written: [[G1125]] ‘My [[G1473]] house [[G3624]] will be called [[G2564]] a house [[G3624]] of prayer [[G4335]] for all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] nations’? [[G1484]] But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] have made [[G4160]] it [[G846]] ‘a den [[G4693]] of robbers.’” [[G3027]] 
18 When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] heard [this], [[G191]] they looked for [[G2212]] a way [[G4459]] to kill [[G622]] Him. [[G846]] For [[G1063]] they were afraid [[G5399]] of Him, [[G846]] because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] crowd [[G3793]] was astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] His [[G846]] teaching. [[G1322]] 
19 And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] evening [[G3796]] came, [[G1096]] [Jesus and His disciples] went [[G1607]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city. [[G4172]] 
20 [As] [[G2532]] they were walking back [[G3899]] in the morning, [[G4404]] they saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] fig tree [[G4808]] withered [[G3583]] from [[G1537]] [its] roots. [[G4491]] 
21 Peter [[G4074]] remembered [it] [[G363]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Look, [[G2400]] Rabbi! [[G4461]] The [[G3588]] fig tree [[G4808]] You cursed [[G2672]] has withered.” [[G3583]] 
22 “Have [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] in God,” [[G2316]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to them. [[G846]] 
23 “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] if anyone [[G3739]] says [[G2036]] to this [[G3778]] mountain, [[G3735]] ‘Be lifted up [[G142]] and [[G2532]] thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea,’ [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] has no doubt [[G1252]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] but [[G235]] believes [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] [it] [[G2980]] will happen, [[G1096]] it will be done [[G1510]] for him. [[G846]] 
24 Therefore [[G1223]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whatever [[G3745]] you ask [[G154]] in prayer, [[G4336]] believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] you have received [it], [[G2983]] and [it] [[G2532]] will be [[G1510]] yours. [[G4771]] 
25 And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] you stand [[G4739]] to pray, [[G4336]] if [[G1487]] you hold [[G2192]] anything [[G5100]] against [[G2596]] [another], [[G5100]] forgive [it], [[G863]] so that [[G2443]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] will forgive [[G863]] your [[G4771]] trespasses [[G3900]] as well.” [[G2532]] 
26 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3756]] forgive, [[G863]] neither [[G3761]] Father [[G3962]] {will} your [[G4771]] who [is] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] forgive [[G863]] your [[G4771]] trespasses. [[G3900]] 
27 After their return [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was walking [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] [and] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] came up [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him. [[G846]] 
28 “By [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] are You doing [[G4160]] these things?” [[G3778]] they asked. [[G2036]] “[And] [[G2228]] who [[G5101]] gave [[G1325]] You [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] authority [[G1849]] to [[G2443]] do [[G4160]] [them]?” [[G3778]] 
29 “I will ask [[G1905]] you [[G4771]] one [[G1520]] question,” [[G3056]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G2036]] “and [if] [[G2532]] you answer [[G611]] Me, [[G1473]] I will tell [[G2046]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I am doing [[G4160]] these things. [[G3778]] 
30 The [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] of John, [[G2491]] was it [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] or [[G2228]] from [[G1537]] men? [[G444]] Answer [[G611]] Me!” [[G1473]] 
31 They deliberated [[G1260]] among [[G4314]] themselves [[G1438]] what [[G5101]] they should answer: [[G2036]] “If [[G1437]] we say, [[G2036]] ‘From [[G1537]] heaven,’ [[G3772]] He will ask, [[G2046]] ‘Why [[G1223]] then [[G3767]] did you not believe [[G4100]] him?’ [[G846]] 
32 But [[G235]] if we say, [[G2036]] ‘From [[G1537]] men’...” [[G444]] they were afraid of [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] for [[G1063]] they all [[G537]] held [[G2192]] that [[G3588]] John [[G2491]] truly [[G3689]] was [[G1510]] a prophet. [[G4396]] 
33 So [[G2532]] they answered [[G611]] [Him], [[G2424]] “We do not know.” [[G1492]] And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G3004]] “Neither [[G3761]] {will} I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I am doing [[G4160]] these things.” [[G3778]]
