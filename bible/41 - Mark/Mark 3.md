[[Mark 2|←]] • [[Mark 4|→]]
1 Once again [[G3825]] [Jesus] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] a man [[G444]] with [[G2192]] a [[G3588]] withered [[G3583]] hand [[G5495]] was [[G1510]] there. [[G1563]] 
2 In order to [[G2443]] accuse [[G2723]] Him, [[G846]] they were watching [[G3906]] {to see} if [[G1487]] He would heal [[G2323]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath. [[G4521]] 
3 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] said [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] with [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] withered [[G3584]] hand, [[G5495]] “Stand up [[G1453]] among [us].” [[G3319]] 
4 And [[G2532]] He asked [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Which is lawful [[G1832]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath: [[G4521]] to do good [[G15]] or [[G2228]] to do evil, [[G2554]] to save [[G4982]] life [[G5590]] or [[G2228]] to destroy [it]?” [[G615]] But [[G1161]] they were silent. [[G4623]] 
5 [Jesus] looked around at [[G4017]] them [[G846]] with [[G3326]] anger [[G3709]] [and] sorrow [[G4818]] at [[G1909]] [their] [[G3588]] hardness [[G4457]] of [[G3588]] heart. [[G2588]] Then [[G2532]] He said [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] “Stretch out [[G1614]] your [[G4771]] hand.” [[G5495]] So he stretched [it] out, [[G1614]] and [[G2532]] [it] [[G5495]] was restored. [[G600]] 
6 At this, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] went out [[G1831]] [and] plotted [[G1325]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Herodians [[G2265]] how [[G3704]] they might kill [[G622]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
7 [So] [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] withdrew [[G402]] with [[G3326]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] accompanied by [[G190]] a large [[G4183]] crowd [[G4128]] from [[G575]] Galilee, [[G1056]] Judea, [[G2449]] 
8 Jerusalem, [[G2414]] Idumea, [[G2401]] the region beyond [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] Jordan, [[G2446]] and [[G2532]] the vicinity of [[G4012]] Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon. [[G4605]] [The] large [[G4183]] crowd [[G4128]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him [[G846]] when they heard [[G191]] what great things [[G3745]] He was doing. [[G4160]] 
9 [Jesus] asked [[G2036]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G2443]] {have} a boat [[G4142]] ready [[G4342]] for Him [[G846]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] would not crush [[G2346]] Him. [[G846]] 
10 For [[G1063]] He had healed [[G2323]] so many [[G4183]] that [[G5620]] all [[G3745]] who had [[G2192]] diseases [[G3148]] were pressing forward [[G1968]] to [[G2443]] touch [[G680]] Him. [[G846]] 
11 And when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirits [[G4151]] saw [[G2334]] Him, [[G846]] they fell down before [[G4363]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] cried out, [[G2896]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God!” [[G2316]] 
12 But [[G2532]] He ordered [[G2008]] them [[G846]] sternly [[G4183]] not [[G3361]] to [[G2443]] make [[G4160]] Him [[G846]] known. [[G5318]] 
13 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] went up [[G305]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] called for [[G4341]] those [[G3739]] He [[G846]] wanted, [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] they came [[G565]] to [[G4314]] Him. [[G846]] 
14 He appointed [[G4160]] twelve [[G1427]] [of them] [[G3739]] [whom] [[G2532]] He designated as [[G3687]] apostles, [[G652]] to [[G2443]] accompany [[G1510]] Him, [[G846]] to [[G2443]] be sent out [[G649]] to preach, [[G2784]] 
15 and [[G2532]] to have [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] to drive out [[G1544]] demons. [[G1140]] 
16 [These are] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] He appointed: [[G4160]] Simon [[G4613]] (whom He named [[G2007]] Peter), [[G4074]] 
17 James [[G2385]] [son] [[G3588]] of [[G3588]] Zebedee [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] his [[G2385]] brother [[G80]] John [[G2491]] ([whom] [[G846]] He named [[G3686]] Boanerges, [[G993]] meaning [[G1510]] Sons [[G5207]] of Thunder), [[G1027]] 
18 Andrew, [[G406]] Philip, [[G5376]] Bartholomew, [[G918]] Matthew, [[G3156]] Thomas, [[G2381]] James [[G2385]] [son] [[G3588]] of Alphaeus, [[G256]] Thaddaeus, [[G2280]] Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] Zealot, [[G2581]] 
19 and [[G2532]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] who [[G3739]] later [[G2532]] betrayed [[G3860]] Him. [[G846]] 
20 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] went [[G2064]] home, [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] once again [[G3825]] a [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] gathered, [[G4905]] so that [[G5620]] [He and His disciples] could [[G1410]] not [[G3361]] even [[G3366]] eat. [[G5315]] 
21 [When] [[G2532]] His family [[G3844]] heard [about this], [[G191]] they went out [[G1831]] to take custody [[G2902]] of Him, [[G846]] saying, [[G2036]] “He is out of His mind.” [[G1839]] 
22 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] who [[G3588]] had come down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] were saying, [[G2036]] “He is possessed [[G2192]] by Beelzebul,” [[G954]] and, [[G2532]] “By [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] of the [[G3588]] demons [[G1140]] He drives out [[G1544]] demons.” [[G1140]] 
23 So [[G2532]] [Jesus] called them together [[G4341]] [and] began to speak [[G2036]] to them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] parables: [[G3850]] “How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] Satan [[G4567]] drive out [[G1544]] Satan? [[G4567]] 
24 If [[G1437]] a kingdom [[G932]] is divided [[G3307]] against [[G1909]] itself, [[G1438]] [it] [[G932]] cannot [[G1410]] stand. [[G2476]] 
25 If [[G1437]] a house [[G3614]] is divided [[G3307]] against [[G1909]] itself, [[G1438]] [it] [[G3614]] cannot [[G1410]] stand. [[G2476]] 
26 And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] Satan [[G4567]] is divided [[G3307]] and [[G2532]] rises [[G450]] against [[G1909]] himself, [[G1438]] he cannot [[G1410]] stand; [[G2476]] [his] end [[G5056]] has come. [[G2192]] 
27 Indeed, [[G235]] no one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] enter [[G1525]] a strong man’s [[G2478]] house [[G3614]] to steal [[G1283]] his [[G846]] possessions [[G4632]] unless [[G1437]] he first ties up [[G1210]] the [[G3588]] strong man. [[G2478]] Then [[G5119]] he can plunder [[G1283]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3614]] 
28 Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of men [[G444]] will be forgiven [[G863]] all [[G3956]] sins [[G265]] and [[G2532]] blasphemies, [[G988]] as many as [[G3745]] they utter. [[G987]] 
29 But [[G1161]] whoever [[G3739]] blasphemes [[G987]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] {will} never [[G3756]] be [[G2192]] forgiven; [[G859]] he is [[G1510]] guilty [[G1777]] [of] eternal [[G166]] sin.” [[G265]] 
30 [ Jesus made this statement ] because [[G3754]] they were claiming, [[G2036]] “He has [[G2192]] an unclean [[G169]] spirit.” [[G4151]] 
31 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] stood [[G4739]] outside. [[G1854]] They sent [someone] in [[G649]] to [[G4314]] summon [[G2564]] Him, [[G846]] 
32 and [[G2532]] a crowd [[G3793]] was sitting [[G2521]] around [[G4012]] Him. [[G846]] “Look,” [[G2400]] He was told, [[G3004]] “Your [[G4771]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] are outside, [[G1854]] asking for [[G2212]] You.” [[G4771]] 
33 But [[G2532]] [Jesus] replied, [[G611]] “Who [[G5101]] are [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] brothers?” [[G80]] 
34 Looking at [[G4017]] those [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] in a circle [[G2945]] around [[G4012]] Him, [[G846]] He said, [[G3004]] “Here [are] [[G2400]] My [[G1473]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] brothers! [[G80]] 
35 For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3739]] does [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] brother [[G80]] and [[G2532]] sister [[G79]] and [[G2532]] mother.” [[G3384]]
