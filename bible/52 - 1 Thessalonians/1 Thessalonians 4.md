1 Finally, [[G3063]] brothers, [[G80]] we ask [[G2065]] and [[G2532]] encourage [[G3870]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] to live [[G4043]] in a way [[G4459]] that is pleasing [[G700]] to God, [[G2316]] as [[G2531]] you have received [[G3880]] from [[G3844]] us. [[G1473]] This is how [[G2531]] you already live, [[G4043]] so [[G2443]] you should do so [[G4052]] all the more. [[G3123]] 
2 For [[G1063]] you know [[G1492]] [the] [[G5101]] instructions [[G3852]] we gave [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] by the authority of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
3 For [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] will [[G2307]] that [[G3778]] you [[G4771]] should be holy: [[G38]] You [[G4771]] must abstain [[G568]] from [[G575]] sexual immorality; [[G4202]] 
4 each [[G1538]] of you [[G4771]] must know [how] [[G1492]] to control [[G2932]] his [[G1438]] [own] [[G3588]] body [[G4632]] in [[G1722]] holiness [[G38]] and [[G2532]] honor, [[G5092]] 
5 not [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] lustful [[G1939]] passion [[G3806]] like [[G2509]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] who [[G3588]] do not know [[G1492]] God; [[G2316]] 
6 [and] no one [[G3361]] should ever exploit [[G5233]] [or] [[G2532]] take advantage of [[G4122]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] in [[G1722]] [this] [[G3588]] regard, [[G4229]] because [[G1360]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] will avenge [[G1558]] all [[G3956]] such [acts], [[G3778]] as [[G2531]] we have already told [[G4302]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] solemnly warned [you]. [[G1263]] 
7 For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] {has} not [[G3756]] called [[G2564]] us [[G1473]] to [[G1909]] impurity, [[G167]] but [[G235]] to [[G1722]] holiness. [[G38]] 
8 Anyone, [[G3588]] then, [[G5105]] who rejects [this command] [[G114]] {does} not [[G3756]] reject [[G114]] man [[G444]] but [[G235]] God, [[G2316]] the very [One who] [[G3588]] gives [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] His [[G846]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
9 Now [[G1161]] about [[G4012]] brotherly love, [[G5360]] you do [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] need [anyone] [[G5532]] to write [[G1125]] to you, [[G4771]] because [[G1063]] you [[G4771]] yourselves [[G846]] have been [[G1510]] taught by God [[G2312]] to love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]] 
10 And [[G2532]] indeed, [[G1063]] you are showing [[G4160]] this [love] [[G846]] to [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] throughout [[G1722]] Macedonia. [[G3109]] But [[G1161]] we urge [[G3870]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] to excel [[G4052]] more and more [[G3123]] 
11 and [[G2532]] to aspire [[G5389]] to live quietly, [[G2270]] to attend to [[G4238]] your own [[G2398]] [matters], [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] to work with [[G2038]] your [[G4771]] own [[G2398]] hands, [[G5495]] as [[G2531]] we instructed [[G3853]] you. [[G4771]] 
12 Then [[G2443]] you will behave [[G4043]] properly [[G2156]] toward [[G4314]] outsiders, [[G1854]] [without] [[G2532]] being [[G2192]] dependent [[G5532]] [on anyone]. [[G3367]] 
13 Brothers, [[G80]] we do not want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be uninformed [[G50]] about [[G4012]] those who [[G3588]] sleep [ in death ], [[G2837]] so that [[G2443]] you will not grieve [[G3076]] like [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] rest, [[G3062]] who [[G3588]] are [[G2192]] without [[G3361]] hope. [[G1680]] 
14 For [[G1063]] since [[G1487]] we believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] died [[G599]] and [[G2532]] rose again, [[G450]] we also believe that [[G3779]] God [[G2316]] will bring [[G71]] with [[G4862]] [Jesus] [[G846]] those who [[G3588]] have fallen asleep [[G2837]] in [[G1223]] [Him]. [[G2424]] 
15 By [[G1722]] [the] word [[G3056]] of [the] Lord, [[G2962]] we declare [[G3004]] to you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] we [[G1473]] who are [[G3588]] alive [[G2198]] [and] remain [[G4035]] until [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] will by no means precede [[G5348]] those who [[G3588]] have fallen asleep. [[G2837]] 
16 For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Himself [[G846]] will descend [[G2597]] from [[G575]] heaven [[G3772]] with [[G1722]] a loud command, [[G2752]] with [[G1722]] the voice [[G5456]] of an archangel, [[G743]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] [the] trumpet [[G4536]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] will be the first to rise. [[G450]] 
17 After that, [[G1899]] we [[G1473]] who are [[G3588]] alive [[G2198]] [and] remain [[G4035]] will be caught up [[G726]] together [[G260]] with [[G4862]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] [the] clouds [[G3507]] to [[G1519]] meet [[G529]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] in [[G1519]] [the] air. [[G109]] And [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] we will [[G1510]] always {be} [[G3842]] with [[G4862]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
18 Therefore [[G5620]] encourage [[G3870]] one another [[G240]] with [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] words. [[G3056]]
