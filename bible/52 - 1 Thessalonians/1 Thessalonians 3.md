1 So [[G1352]] [when] we could bear [it] [[G4722]] no longer, [[G3371]] we were willing [[G2106]] to be left [[G2641]] on our own [[G3441]] in [[G1722]] Athens. [[G116]] 
2 We sent [[G3992]] Timothy, [[G5095]] our [[G1473]] brother [[G80]] and [[G2532]] God’s [[G2316]] fellow worker [[G4904]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of Christ, [[G5547]] to [[G1519]] strengthen [[G4741]] and [[G2532]] encourage [[G3870]] you [[G4771]] in [[G5228]] your [[G4771]] faith, [[G4102]] 
3 so that [[G3588]] none [of you] [[G3367]] would be shaken [[G4525]] by [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] trials. [[G2347]] For [[G1063]] you [[G846]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we are destined [[G2749]] for [[G1519]] this. [[G3778]] 
4 Indeed, [[G1063]] when [[G3753]] we were [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] we kept warning you [[G4302]] that [[G3754]] we would [[G3195]] suffer persecution; [[G2346]] and as [[G2531]] you know, [[G1492]] it has come to pass. [[G1096]] 
5 For this reason, [[G1223]] [when] I could bear [it] [[G4722]] no longer, [[G3371]] I [[G2504]] sent [[G3992]] to [[G1519]] find out about [[G1097]] your [[G4771]] faith, [[G4102]] [for fear that] [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] tempter [[G3985]] {had} somehow [[G4459]] tempted [[G3985]] you [[G4771]] and [caused] [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] labor [[G2873]] to be [[G1096]] in [[G1519]] vain. [[G2756]] 
6 But [[G1161]] now [[G737]] Timothy [[G5095]] has returned [[G2064]] from [[G575]] [ his visit] [[G4771]] with the good news [[G2097]] about your [[G4771]] faith, [[G4102]] [your] [[G3588]] love, [[G26]] and [[G2532]] [the] fond [[G18]] memories [[G3417]] you have preserved, [[G2192]] longing [[G1971]] to see [[G3708]] us [[G1473]] just as [[G2509]] we [[G1473]] [long to see] [[G2532]] you. [[G4771]] 
7 For this reason, [[G1223]] brothers, [[G80]] in [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] our [[G1473]] distress [[G318]] and [[G2532]] persecution, [[G2347]] we have been reassured [[G3870]] about [[G1909]] you, [[G4771]] because of [[G1223]] your [[G4771]] faith. [[G4102]] 
8 For [[G3754]] now [[G3568]] we can go on living, [[G2198]] as long as [[G1437]] you [[G4771]] are standing firm [[G4739]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
9 How [[G5101]] can we [[G1410]] [adequately] thank [[G2169]] God [[G2316]] for [[G4012]] you [[G4771]] in return for [[G1909]] our great joy [[G5463]] over [[G1223]] you [[G4771]] in [His] presence? [[G1715]] 
10 Night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] we pray [[G1189]] most earnestly [[G5228]] that [[G1519]] we may see [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] face to face [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] supply [[G2675]] what [[G3588]] is lacking [[G5303]] from your [[G4771]] faith. [[G4102]] 
11 Now [[G1161]] {may} our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] Himself, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] direct [[G2720]] our [[G1473]] way [[G3598]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]] 
12 And [[G1161]] {may} the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] cause you to increase [[G4121]] and [[G2532]] overflow [[G4052]] with love [[G26]] for [[G1519]] one another [[G240]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] everyone [else], [[G3956]] just as [[G2509]] our [[G1473]] [love] [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] you [overflows], [[G4771]] 
13 so that [[G1519]] He may establish [[G4741]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] in blamelessness [[G273]] [and] [[G1722]] holiness [[G42]] before [[G1715]] our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] His [[G846]] saints. [[G40]] Amen. [[G281]]
