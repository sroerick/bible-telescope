1 Now [[G1161]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] times [[G5550]] and [[G2532]] seasons, [[G2540]] brothers, [[G80]] {we do} not [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] to write [[G1125]] to you. [[G4771]] 
2 For [[G1063]] you [[G846]] {are} fully [[G199]] aware [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [the] day [[G2250]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] will come [[G2064]] like [[G5613]] a thief [[G2812]] in [[G1722]] [the] night. [[G3571]] 
3 While [[G3752]] [people] are saying, [[G3004]] “Peace [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] security,” [[G803]] destruction [[G3639]] will come [[G2186]] upon them [[G846]] suddenly, [[G160]] like [[G5618]] labor pains [[G5604]] on [[G3588]] a pregnant woman, [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] they will not escape. [[G1628]] 
4 But [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] [the] darkness [[G4655]] so that [[G2443]] [this] [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] should overtake [[G2638]] you [[G4771]] like [[G5613]] a thief. [[G2812]] 
5 For [[G1063]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] sons [[G5207]] of [the] light [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] sons [[G5207]] of [the] day; [[G2250]] we do not belong [[G1510]] to [the] night [[G3571]] [or] [[G3761]] to [the] darkness. [[G4655]] 
6 So [[G686]] then, [[G3767]] let us not sleep [[G2518]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] others [do], [[G3062]] but [[G235]] let us remain awake [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] sober. [[G3525]] 
7 For [[G1063]] those who [[G3588]] sleep, [[G2518]] sleep [[G2518]] at night; [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] get drunk, [[G3182]] get drunk [[G3184]] at night. [[G3571]] 
8 But [since] [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] belong to [[G1510]] [the] day, [[G2250]] let us be sober, [[G3525]] putting on [[G1746]] [the] breastplate [[G2382]] of faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] love, [[G26]] and [[G2532]] [the] helmet [[G4030]] [of our] hope [[G1680]] of salvation. [[G4991]] 
9 For [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] has not appointed [[G5087]] us [[G1473]] to [[G1519]] [suffer] wrath, [[G3709]] but [[G235]] to [[G1519]] obtain [[G4047]] salvation [[G4991]] through [[G1223]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
10 He [[G3588]] died [[G599]] for [[G4012]] us [[G1473]] so that, [[G2443]] whether [[G1535]] we are awake [[G1127]] or [[G1535]] asleep, [[G2518]] we may live [[G2198]] together [[G260]] with [[G4862]] Him. [[G846]] 
11 Therefore [[G1352]] encourage [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] build [[G3618]] one [[G1520]] another {up}, [[G1520]] just as [[G2531]] you are already doing. [[G4160]] 
12 But [[G1161]] we ask [[G2065]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] to acknowledge [[G1492]] those who [[G3588]] work diligently [[G2872]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] [who] preside [[G4291]] over you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] give you instruction. [[G3560]] 
13 In [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] hold [[G2233]] them [[G846]] in highest {regard} [[G5228]] because of [[G1223]] their [[G846]] work. [[G2041]] Live in peace [[G1514]] with [[G1722]] one another. [[G1438]] 
14 And [[G1161]] we urge [[G3870]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] to admonish [[G3560]] the [[G3588]] unruly, [[G813]] encourage [[G3888]] the [[G3588]] fainthearted, [[G3642]] help [[G472]] the [[G3588]] weak, [[G772]] [and] be patient [[G3114]] with [[G4314]] everyone. [[G3956]] 
15 Make sure that [[G3708]] no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] repays [[G591]] evil [[G2556]] for [[G473]] evil. [[G2556]] Always [[G3842]] pursue [[G1377]] what [is] [[G3588]] good [[G18]] for [[G1519]] one another [[G240]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] all [people]. [[G3956]] 
16 Rejoice [[G5463]] at all times. [[G3842]] 
17 Pray [[G4336]] without ceasing. [[G89]] 
18 Give thanks [[G2168]] in [[G1722]] every circumstance, [[G3956]] for [[G1063]] this [is] [[G3778]] God’s [[G2316]] will [[G2307]] for [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
19 Do not extinguish [[G4570]] the [[G3588]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
20 Do not treat [[G1848]] prophecies {with contempt}, [[G4394]] 
21 but [[G1161]] test [[G1381]] all things. [[G3956]] Hold fast [[G2722]] to what [is] [[G3588]] good. [[G2570]] 
22 Abstain [[G568]] from [[G575]] every [[G3956]] form [[G1491]] of evil. [[G4190]] 
23 Now [[G1161]] {may} the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of peace [[G1515]] Himself [[G846]] sanctify [[G37]] you [[G4771]] completely, [[G3651]] and [[G2532]] {may} your [[G4771]] entire [[G3648]] spirit, [[G4151]] soul, [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] body [[G4983]] be kept [[G5083]] blameless [[G274]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
24 The [One who] [[G3588]] calls [[G2564]] you [[G4771]] [is] faithful, [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] [He] [[G3739]] will do [it]. [[G4160]] 
25 Brothers, [[G80]] pray [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] us [[G1473]] as well. [[G2532]] 
26 Greet [[G782]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] with [[G1722]] a holy [[G40]] kiss. [[G5370]] 
27 I charge [[G3726]] you [[G4771]] [before] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] [to have this] [[G3588]] letter [[G1992]] read [[G314]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]] 
28 [May] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [be] with [[G3326]] you. [[G4771]]
