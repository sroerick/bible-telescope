# Titus 1
[[2 Timothy 4|←]] • [[Titus 2|→]]
1 Paul, [[G3972]] a servant [[G1401]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] an apostle [[G652]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] in service of [[G2596]] [the] faith [[G4102]] of God’s [[G2316]] elect [[G1588]] and [[G2532]] [of their] knowledge [[G1922]] of [the] truth [[G225]] that [[G3588]] leads to [[G2596]] godliness, [[G2150]] 
2 in [[G1909]] [the] hope [[G1680]] of eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] which [[G3739]] God, [[G2316]] who cannot lie, [[G893]] promised [[G1861]] before [[G4253]] time [[G5550]] began. [[G166]] 
3 [In His] own [[G2398]] time, [[G2540]] He has revealed [[G5319]] His [[G846]] message [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] [the] proclamation [[G2782]] entrusted [[G4100]] to me [[G1473]] by [[G2596]] [the] command [[G2003]] of God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Savior. [[G4990]] 
4 To Titus, [[G5103]] [my] true [[G1103]] child [[G5043]] in [[G2596]] [our] common [[G2839]] faith: [[G4102]] Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Savior. [[G4990]] 
5 The reason [[G5484]] I left [[G620]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] Crete [[G2914]] [was] that [[G2443]] you would set in order [[G1930]] what was [[G3588]] unfinished [[G3007]] and [[G2532]] appoint [[G2525]] elders [[G4245]] in every [[G2596]] town, [[G4172]] as [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] directed [[G1299]] you. [[G4771]] 
6 [An elder must] [[G1487]] be [[G1510]] blameless, [[G410]] [the] husband [[G435]] of one [[G1520]] wife, [[G1135]] having [[G2192]] children [[G5043]] who are believers [[G4103]] [and are] not [[G3361]] open to [[G1722]] accusation [[G2724]] of indiscretion [[G810]] or [[G2228]] insubordination. [[G506]] 
7 As [[G5613]] God’s [[G2316]] steward, [[G3623]] an overseer [[G1985]] must [[G1163]] be [[G1510]] above reproach— [[G410]] not [[G3361]] self-absorbed, [[G829]] not [[G3361]] quick-tempered, [[G3711]] not [[G3361]] given to drunkenness, [[G3943]] not [[G3361]] violent, [[G4131]] not [[G3361]] greedy for money. [[G146]] 
8 Instead, [[G235]] [he must be] hospitable, [[G5382]] a lover of good, [[G5358]] self-controlled, [[G4998]] upright, [[G1342]] holy, [[G3741]] [and] disciplined. [[G1468]] 
9 He must hold firmly [[G472]] to the [[G3588]] trustworthy [[G4103]] message [[G3056]] as [[G2596]] it was taught, [[G1322]] so that [[G2443]] by [[G1722]] sound [[G5198]] teaching [[G1319]] he will be able [[G1510]] to encourage [others] [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] refute [[G1651]] those who [[G3588]] contradict [this message]. [[G483]] 
10 For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] are [[G1510]] rebellious [[G506]] and [[G2532]] full of empty talk [[G3151]] and [[G2532]] deception, [[G5423]] especially [[G3122]] those [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] circumcision, [[G4061]] 
11 who [[G3739]] must [[G1163]] be silenced. [[G1993]] For [the] sake of [[G5484]] dishonorable [[G150]] gain, [[G2771]] [they] [[G3748]] undermine [[G396]] entire [[G3650]] households [[G3624]] [and] teach [[G1321]] things [[G3739]] they should [[G1163]] not. [[G3361]] 
12 [As] one [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] own [[G2398]] prophets [[G4396]] has said, [[G2036]] “Cretans [[G2912]] [are] always [[G104]] liars, [[G5583]] evil [[G2556]] beasts, [[G2342]] lazy [[G692]] gluttons.” [[G1064]] 
13 This [[G3778]] testimony [[G3141]] is [[G1510]] true. [[G227]] Therefore [[G156]] rebuke [[G1651]] them [[G846]] sternly, [[G664]] so that [[G2443]] they will be sound [[G5198]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] 
14 [and] will pay no attention [[G4337]] to Jewish [[G2451]] myths [[G3454]] [or] [[G2532]] [to the] commands [[G1785]] of men [[G444]] who have rejected [[G654]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] 
15 To the [[G3588]] pure, [[G2513]] all things [are] [[G3956]] pure; [[G2513]] but [[G1161]] to the [[G3588]] defiled [[G3392]] and [[G2532]] unbelieving, [[G571]] nothing [[G3762]] [is] pure. [[G2513]] Indeed, [[G235]] both [[G2532]] their [[G846]] minds [[G3563]] and [[G2532]] [their] [[G3588]] consciences [[G4893]] are defiled. [[G3392]] 
16 They profess [[G3670]] to know [[G1492]] God, [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] they deny [Him] [[G720]] by [their] [[G3588]] actions. [[G2041]] They are [[G1510]] detestable, [[G947]] disobedient, [[G545]] and [[G2532]] unfit [[G96]] for [[G4314]] any [[G3956]] good [[G18]] deed. [[G2041]]
