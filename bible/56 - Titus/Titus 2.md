1 But [[G1161]] [as for] you, [[G4771]] speak [[G2980]] the things that [[G3739]] are consistent with [[G4241]] sound [[G5198]] doctrine. [[G1319]] 
2 Older [men] [[G4246]] are to be [[G1510]] temperate, [[G3524]] dignified, [[G4586]] self-controlled, [[G4998]] [and] sound [[G5198]] in faith, [[G4102]] love, [[G26]] and [[G3588]] perseverance. [[G5281]] 
3 Older [women], [[G4247]] likewise, [[G5615]] are to be reverent [[G2412]] in [[G1722]] [their] behavior, [[G2688]] not [[G3361]] slanderers [[G1228]] [or] [[G3366]] addicted [[G1402]] to much [[G4183]] wine, [[G3631]] [but] teachers of good. [[G2567]] 
4 In this way [[G2443]] they can train [[G4994]] the [[G3588]] young [women] [[G3501]] to [[G1510]] love [their] husbands [[G5362]] [and] children, [[G5388]] 
5 [to be] self-controlled, [[G4998]] pure, [[G53]] managers of their households, [[G3626]] kind, [[G18]] [and] subject [[G5293]] to [their] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] husbands, [[G435]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] will not be discredited. [[G987]] 
6 In the same way, [[G5615]] urge [[G3870]] the [[G3588]] younger [men] [[G3501]] to be self-controlled. [[G4993]] 
7 In [[G4012]] everything, [[G3956]] show [[G3930]] yourself [[G4572]] {to be} an example [[G5179]] [by doing] good [[G2570]] works. [[G2041]] In [[G1722]] [your] [[G3588]] teaching [[G1319]] [show] integrity, [[G861]] dignity, [[G4587]] 
8 [and] wholesome [[G5199]] speech [[G3056]] [that is] above reproach, [[G176]] so that [[G2443]] anyone [[G3588]] who [[G1537]] opposes [us] [[G1727]] will be ashamed [[G1788]] to have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3367]] bad [[G5337]] to say [[G3004]] about [[G4012]] us. [[G1473]] 
9 Slaves [[G1401]] are to submit [[G5293]] to their own [[G2398]] masters [[G1203]] in [[G1722]] everything, [[G3956]] to be [[G1510]] well-pleasing, [[G2101]] not [[G3361]] argumentative, [[G483]] 
10 not [[G3361]] stealing [from them], [[G3557]] but [[G235]] showing [[G1731]] all [[G3956]] good [[G18]] faith, [[G4102]] so that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] every respect [[G3956]] they will adorn [[G2885]] the [[G3588]] teaching [[G1319]] about [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Savior. [[G4990]] 
11 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of God [[G2316]] has appeared, [[G2014]] bringing salvation [[G4992]] to all [[G3956]] men. [[G444]] 
12 It instructs [[G3811]] us [[G1473]] to [[G2443]] renounce [[G720]] ungodliness [[G763]] and [[G2532]] worldly [[G2886]] passions, [[G1939]] [and] to live [[G2198]] sensible, [[G4996]] upright, [[G1346]] and [[G2532]] godly [lives] [[G2153]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] present [[G3568]] age, [[G165]] 
13 as we await [[G4327]] the [[G3588]] blessed [[G3107]] hope [[G1680]] and [[G2532]] glorious [[G1391]] appearance [[G2015]] of [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] great [[G3173]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Savior, [[G4990]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
14 He [[G3739]] gave [[G1325]] Himself [[G1438]] for [[G5228]] us [[G1473]] to [[G2443]] redeem [[G3084]] us [[G1473]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] lawlessness [[G458]] and [[G2532]] to purify [[G2511]] for Himself [[G1438]] a people [[G2992]] for His own possession, [[G4041]] zealous [[G2207]] for good [[G2570]] deeds. [[G2041]] 
15 Speak [[G2980]] these things [[G3778]] [as] [[G2532]] you encourage [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] rebuke [[G1651]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] authority. [[G2003]] {Let} no one [[G3367]] despise [[G4065]] you. [[G4771]]
