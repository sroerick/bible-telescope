1 Again [[H7725]] I lifted [[H5375]] up my eyes [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] before me [[H2009]] a flying [[H5774]] scroll. [[H4039]] 
2 “What [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] see?” [[H7200]] asked [the angel]. [[H559]] “I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] a flying [[H5774]] scroll,” [[H4039]] I replied, [[H559]] “twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] wide.” [[H7341]] 
3 Then he told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] “This [[H2063]] is the curse [[H423]] that is going out [[H3318]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of all [[H3605]] the land, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] according [to] [[H3644]] one [side] of [the scroll], [[H2088]] every [[H3605]] thief [[H1589]] will be removed; [[H5352]] and according to [[H3644]] the other side, [[H2088]] everyone [[H3605]] who swears falsely [[H7650]] will be removed. [[H5352]] 
4 I will send it out, [[H3318]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] and it will enter [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the thief [[H1590]] and the house [[H1004]] of him who swears [[H7650]] falsely [[H8267]] by My name. [[H8034]] It will remain [[H3885]] inside [[H8432]] his house [[H1004]] and destroy it, [[H3615]] [down to] [[H854]] its timbers [[H6086]] and its stones.” [[H68]] 
5 Then the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking [[H1696]] with me came forward [[H3318]] and told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] “Now [[H4994]] lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] and see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] is approaching.” [[H3318]] 
6 “What [[H4100]] is it?” [[H1931]] I asked. [[H559]] And he replied, [[H559]] “It is [[H2063]] a measuring basket [[H374]] that is approaching.” [[H3318]] Then he continued, [[H559]] “This [[H2063]] is their iniquity [[H5869]] in all [[H3605]] the land.” [[H776]] 
7 And behold, [[H2009]] the cover [[H3603]] of lead [[H5777]] was raised, [[H5375]] and there was [[H259]] a woman [[H802]] sitting [[H3427]] inside [[H8432]] the basket. [[H374]] 
8 “This [[H2063]] is Wickedness,” [[H7564]] he said. [[H559]] And he shoved her down [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the basket, [[H374]] pushing down [[H7993]] the lead [[H5777]] cover [[H68]] over [[H413]] its opening. [[H6310]] 
9 Then I lifted [[H5375]] up my eyes [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] two [[H8147]] women [[H802]] approaching, [[H3318]] with the wind [[H7307]] in their wings. [[H3671]] Their [[H2007]] wings [[H3671]] were like those [[H3671]] of a stork, [[H2624]] and they lifted up [[H5375]] the basket [[H374]] between [[H996]] heaven [[H8064]] and [[H996]] earth. [[H776]] 
10 “Where [[H575]] are they [[H1992]] taking [[H1980]] the basket?” [[H374]] I asked [[H559]] the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking [[H1696]] with me.  
11 “To build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for it  in the land [[H776]] of Shinar,” [[H8152]] he told me. [[H559]] “And when it is ready, [[H3559]] the basket will be set [[H3240]] there [[H8033]] on [[H5921]] its pedestal.” [[H4369]]
