1 An oracle [[H4853]] of the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] concerning [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] [Thus] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who stretches out [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] and lays the foundation [[H3245]] of the earth, [[H776]] who forms [[H3335]] the spirit [[H7307]] of man [[H120]] within him: [[H7130]] 
2 “Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will make [[H7760]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a cup [[H5592]] of drunkenness [[H7478]] to all [[H3605]] the surrounding [[H5439]] peoples. [[H5971]] Judah [[H3063]] will be [[H1961]] besieged, [[H4692]] as well as [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
3 On that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] when all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth [[H776]] gather [[H622]] against her, [[H5921]] I will make [[H7760]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a heavy [[H4614]] stone [[H68]] for all [[H3605]] the peoples; [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] who would heave it away [[H6006]] will be severely [[H8295]] injured. [[H8295]] 
4 On that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “I will strike [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] horse [[H5483]] with panic, [[H8541]] and [every] rider [[H7392]] with madness. [[H7697]] I will keep a watchful [[H6491]] eye [[H5869]] on [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] but I will strike [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the horses [[H5483]] of the nations [[H5971]] with blindness. [[H5788]] 
5 Then the leaders [[H441]] of Judah [[H3063]] will say [[H559]] in their hearts: [[H3820]] ‘The people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] are my strength, [[H556]] for the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] [is] their God.’ [[H430]] 
6 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will make [[H7760]] the clans [[H441]] of Judah [[H3063]] like a firepot [[H3595]] in a woodpile, [[H6086]] like a flaming [[H784]] torch [[H3940]] among the sheaves; [[H5995]] they will consume [[H398]] all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] around them [[H5439]] on [[H5921]] the right [[H3225]] and on [[H5921]] the left, [[H8040]] while the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] remain [[H5750]] secure [[H8478]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
7 The LORD [[H3068]] will save [[H3467]] the tents [[H168]] of Judah [[H3063]] first, [[H7223]] so that [[H4616]] the glory [[H8597]] of the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] [and] [[H8597]] of the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] may not [[H3808]] be greater [[H1431]] than [[H5921]] that of Judah. [[H3063]] 
8 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] will defend [[H1598]] the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] so that [[H1931]] the weakest [[H3782]] among them  will be [[H1961]] like David, [[H1732]] and the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] will be like God, [[H430]] like the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] going before them. [[H6440]] 
9 So [[H1961]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will set out [[H1245]] to destroy [[H8045]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] that come [[H935]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
10 Then I will pour out [[H8210]] on [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] and on [[H5921]] the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] a spirit [[H7307]] of grace [[H2580]] and prayer, [[H8469]] and they will look [[H5027]] on Me, [[H413]] the One [[H834]] they have pierced. [[H1856]] They will mourn [[H5594]] for Him [[H5921]] as one mourns [[H5594]] an only child, [[H3173]] and weep bitterly [[H4843]] for Him [[H5921]] as one grieves [[H4843]] a firstborn son. [[H1060]] 
11 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the mourning [[H4553]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] will be as great [[H1431]] as the mourning [[H4553]] of Hadad-rimmon [[H1910]] in the plain [[H1237]] of Megiddo. [[H4023]] 
12 The land [[H776]] will mourn, [[H5594]] each [[H4940]] clan [[H4940]] on its own: [[H905]] the clan [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] and their wives, [[H802]] the clan [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of Nathan [[H5416]] and their wives, [[H802]] 
13 the clan [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of Levi [[H3878]] and their wives, [[H802]] the clan [[H4940]] of Shimei [[H8097]] and their wives, [[H802]] 
14 and all [[H3605]] the remaining [[H7604]] clans [[H4940]] and their wives. [[H802]]
