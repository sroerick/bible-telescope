# Zechariah 1
[[Haggai 2|←]] • [[Zechariah 2|→]]
1 In the eighth [[H8066]] month [[H2320]] of the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of [the reign] of Darius, [[H1867]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1121]] of Berechiah, [[H1296]] the son [[H1121]] of Iddo, [[H5714]] saying: [[H559]] 
2 “The LORD [[H3068]] was very [[H7110]] angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] your forefathers. [[H1]] 
3 So tell [the people] [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘Return [[H7725]] to Me,’ [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] ‘and I will return [[H7725]] to you,’ [[H413]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
4 Do not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] like your forefathers, [[H1]] to whom [[H834]] the former [[H7223]] prophets [[H5030]] proclaimed: [[H7121]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘Turn [[H7725]] now [[H4994]] from your evil [[H7451]] ways [[H1870]] and your evil [[H7451]] deeds.’ [[H4611]] But they did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] or pay attention [[H7181]] to Me, [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 Where [[H346]] are your forefathers now? [[H1]] And the prophets, [[H5030]] do they live [[H2421]] forever? [[H5769]] 
6 But [[H389]] did not [[H3808]] My words [[H1697]] and My statutes, [[H2706]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] My servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] overtake [[H5381]] your forefathers? [[H1]] They repented [[H7725]] and said, [[H559]] ‘Just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] purposed [[H2161]] to do [[H6213]] to us  according to our ways [[H1870]] and deeds, [[H4611]] so [[H3651]] He has done [[H6213]] to us. [[H854]] 
7 On the twenty-fourth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the eleventh [[H6249]] month, [[H2320]] the month [[H2320]] of Shebat, [[H7627]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Darius, [[H1867]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1121]] of Berechiah, [[H1296]] the son [[H1121]] of Iddo. [[H5714]] 
8 I looked out [[H7200]] into the night [[H3915]] and saw [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] riding [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] a red [[H122]] horse [[H5483]] that [[H1931]] stood [[H5975]] among [[H996]] the myrtle trees [[H1918]] in the hollow. [[H4699]] Behind him [[H310]] were red, [[H122]] sorrel, [[H8320]] and white [[H3836]] horses. [[H5483]] 
9 “What [[H4100]] are these, [[H428]] my lord?” [[H113]] I asked. [[H559]] And the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking [[H1696]] with me  replied, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] will show [[H7200]] you what [[H4100]] they are.” [[H1992]] 
10 Then the man [[H376]] standing [[H5975]] among [[H996]] the myrtle trees [[H1918]] explained, [[H6030]] “They [[H428]] are the ones [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has sent [[H7971]] to patrol [[H1980]] the earth.” [[H776]] 
11 And [the riders] answered [[H6030]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3069]] who stood [[H5975]] among [[H996]] the myrtle trees, [[H1918]] “We have patrolled [[H1980]] the earth, [[H776]] and behold, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] is at rest [[H3427]] and tranquil.” [[H8252]] 
12 Then the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “How long, [[H5704]] O LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] will You [[H859]] withhold mercy [[H3808]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] and the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] with which [[H834]] You have been angry [[H2194]] these [[H2088]] seventy [[H7657]] years?” [[H8141]] 
13 So the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H6030]] kind [[H2896]] and comforting [[H5150]] words [[H1697]] to the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking [[H1696]] with me.  
14 Then the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking [[H1696]] with me said, [[H559]] “Proclaim [[H7121]] this word: [[H559]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘I am very [[H1419]] jealous [[H7065]] for Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Zion, [[H6726]] 
15 but I [[H589]] am fiercely angry [[H7110]] with [[H5921]] the nations [[H1471]] that are at ease. [[H7600]] For [[H834]] I [[H589]] was a little [[H4592]] angry, [[H7107]] but they [[H1992]] have increased [[H5826]] the calamity.’ [[H7451]] 
16 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will return [[H7725]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] with mercy, [[H7356]] and there  My house [[H1004]] will be rebuilt, [[H1129]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] and a measuring line [[H6961]] will be stretched out [[H5186]] over [[H5921]] Jerusalem.’ [[H3389]] 
17 Proclaim [[H7121]] further: [[H5750]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘My cities [[H5892]] will again [[H5750]] overflow [[H6327]] with prosperity; [[H2896]] the LORD [[H3068]] will again [[H5750]] comfort [[H5162]] Zion [[H6726]] [and] [[H5750]] choose [[H977]] Jerusalem.’” [[H3389]] 
18 Then I looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] four [[H702]] horns. [[H7161]] 
19 So I asked [[H559]] the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking [[H1696]] with me,  “What [[H4100]] are these?” [[H428]] And he told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] “These [[H428]] are the horns [[H7161]] that [[H834]] scattered [[H2219]] Judah, [[H3063]] Israel, [[H3478]] and Jerusalem.” [[H3389]] 
20 Then the LORD [[H3068]] showed [[H7200]] me four [[H702]] craftsmen. [[H2796]] 
21 “What [[H4100]] are these [[H428]] coming [[H935]] to do?” [[H6213]] I asked. [[H559]] And He replied, [[H559]] “These [[H428]] are the horns [[H7161]] that [[H834]] scattered [[H2219]] Judah [[H3063]] so that [[H6310]] no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] could raise [[H5375]] his head; [[H7218]] but the [craftsmen] [[H428]] have come [[H935]] to terrify [[H2729]] them [[H853]] [and] throw down [[H3034]] these horns [[H7161]] of the nations [[H1471]] that lifted up [[H5375]] their horns [[H7161]] against [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] to scatter it.” [[H2219]]
