1 Behold, [[H2009]] a day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is coming [[H935]] when your plunder [[H7998]] will be divided [[H2505]] in your presence. [[H7130]] 
2 For I will gather [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] for battle [[H4421]] against [[H413]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the city [[H5892]] will be captured, [[H3920]] the houses [[H1004]] looted, [[H8155]] and the women [[H802]] ravished. [[H7693]] Half [[H2677]] of the city [[H5892]] will go [[H3318]] into captivity, [[H1473]] but the rest [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] will not [[H3808]] be removed [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] the city. [[H5892]] 
3 Then the LORD [[H3069]] will go out [[H3318]] to fight [[H3898]] against those [[H1992]] nations, [[H1471]] as He fights [[H3898]] in the day [[H3117]] of battle. [[H7128]] 
4 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] His feet [[H7272]] will stand [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the Mount [[H2022]] of Olives, [[H2132]] east [[H6924]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the Mount [[H2022]] of Olives [[H2132]] will be split [[H1234]] in two [[H2677]] from east [[H4217]] to west, [[H3220]] forming a great [[H1419]] valley, [[H1516]] with half [[H2677]] the mountain [[H2022]] moving [[H4185]] to the north [[H6828]] and half [[H2677]] to the south. [[H5045]] 
5 You will flee [[H5127]] by My mountain [[H2022]] valley, [[H1516]] for [[H3588]] [it] [[H1516]] will extend [[H5060]] to [[H413]] Azal. [[H682]] You will flee [[H5127]] as [[H834]] you fled [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] the earthquake [[H7494]] in the days [[H3117]] of Uzziah [[H5818]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]] Then the LORD [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] will come, [[H935]] and all [[H3605]] the holy ones [[H6918]] with Him. [[H5973]] 
6 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] there will be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] light, [[H216]] no cold [[H3368]] or frost. [[H7087]] 
7 It will be [[H1961]] a day [[H3117]] known [[H3045]] only [[H259]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] without [[H3808]] day [[H3117]] or night; [[H3915]] but when evening [[H6153]] comes, [[H1961]] there will be [[H1961]] light. [[H216]] 
8 And [[H1961]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] living [[H2416]] water [[H4325]] will flow out [[H3318]] from Jerusalem, [[H3389]] half [[H2677]] of it toward [[H413]] the eastern [[H6931]] sea [[H3220]] and the other half [[H2677]] toward [[H413]] the western [[H314]] sea, [[H3220]] in summer [[H7019]] and winter alike. [[H2779]] 
9 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] will become [[H1961]] King [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth— [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] alone, [[H259]] and His name [[H8034]] alone. [[H259]] 
10 All [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] from Geba [[H1387]] to Rimmon [[H7417]] south [[H5045]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] will be turned [[H5437]] into a plain, [[H6160]] but Jerusalem will be raised up [[H7213]] and will remain [[H3427]] in her place, [[H8478]] from the Benjamin [[H1144]] Gate [[H8179]] to [[H5704]] the site [[H4725]] of the First [[H7223]] Gate, [[H8179]] to [[H5704]] the Corner [[H6434]] Gate, [[H8179]] and from the Tower [[H4026]] of Hananel [[H2606]] to [[H5704]] the royal [[H4428]] winepresses. [[H3342]] 
11 People will live [[H3427]] there,  and never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] will there be [[H1961]] an [utter] destruction. [[H2764]] So Jerusalem [[H3389]] will dwell [[H3427]] securely. [[H983]] 
12 And this [[H2063]] will be [[H1961]] the plague [[H4046]] with which the LORD [[H3068]] strikes [[H5062]] all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] who [[H834]] have warred [[H6633]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]] Their flesh [[H1320]] will rot [[H4743]] while they [[H1931]] stand [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] their feet, [[H7272]] their eyes [[H5869]] will rot [[H4743]] in their sockets, [[H2356]] and their tongues [[H3956]] will rot [[H4743]] in their mouths. [[H6310]] 
13 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] a great [[H7227]] panic [[H4103]] from the LORD [[H3068]] will come upon them, [[H1961]] so that each [[H376]] will seize [[H2388]] the hand [[H3027]] of another, [[H7453]] and the hand [[H3027]] of one will rise [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] the other. [[H7453]] 
14 Judah [[H3063]] will also [[H1571]] fight [[H3898]] at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the wealth [[H2428]] of all [[H3605]] the surrounding [[H5439]] nations [[H1471]] will be collected— [[H622]] gold, [[H2091]] silver, [[H3701]] and apparel [[H899]] in great abundance. [[H7230]] 
15 And a similar [[H3651]] plague [[H4046]] will strike [[H1961]] the horses [[H5483]] and mules, [[H6505]] camels [[H1581]] and donkeys, [[H2543]] and all [[H3605]] the animals [[H929]] in those [[H1992]] camps. [[H4264]] 
16 Then all [[H3605]] the survivors [[H3498]] from [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] that came [[H935]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] will go up [[H5927]] year [[H8141]] after year [[H8141]] to worship [[H7812]] the King, [[H4428]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] and to celebrate [[H2287]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Tabernacles. [[H5521]] 
17 And should any of the families [[H4940]] of the earth [[H776]] not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] to worship [[H7812]] the King, [[H4428]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the rain [[H1653]] will not [[H3808]] fall [[H1961]] on them. [[H5921]] 
18 And if [[H518]] the people [[H4940]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] and enter in, [[H935]] then rain will not [[H3808]] fall on them; [[H5921]] this will be [[H1961]] the plague [[H4046]] the LORD [[H3068]] inflicts [[H5062]] on the nations [[H1471]] who [[H834]] do not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] to celebrate [[H2287]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Tabernacles. [[H5521]] 
19 This [[H2063]] will be [[H1961]] the punishment [[H2403]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and of all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] do not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] to celebrate [[H2287]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Tabernacles. [[H5521]] 
20 On that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] HOLY [[H6944]] TO THE LORD [[H3068]] will be [inscribed] [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the bells [[H4698]] of the horses, [[H5483]] and the cooking pots [[H5518]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] like the sprinkling basins [[H4219]] before [[H6440]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
21 Indeed, every [[H3605]] pot [[H5518]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah [[H3063]] will be [[H1961]] holy [[H6944]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] and all [[H3605]] who sacrifice [[H2076]] will come [[H935]] and take [[H3947]] some [pots] [[H1992]] and cook [[H1310]] in them.  And on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] there will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] a Canaanite [[H3669]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]
