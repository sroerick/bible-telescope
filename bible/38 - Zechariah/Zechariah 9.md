1 An Oracle: [[H4853]] The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is against the land [[H776]] of Hadrach [[H2317]] and will rest [[H4496]] upon Damascus— [[H1834]] for [[H3588]] the eyes [[H5869]] of men [[H120]] and of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] are upon the LORD— [[H3068]] 
2 and also [[H1571]] upon Hamath, [[H2574]] which borders it, [[H1379]] as well as Tyre [[H6865]] and Sidon, [[H6721]] though [[H3588]] they are very [[H3966]] shrewd. [[H2449]] 
3 Tyre [[H6865]] has built [[H1129]] herself  a fortress; [[H4692]] she has heaped up [[H6651]] silver [[H3701]] like dust, [[H6083]] and gold [[H2742]] like the dirt [[H2916]] of the streets. [[H2351]] 
4 Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] will impoverish her [[H3423]] and cast [[H5221]] her power [[H2428]] into the sea, [[H3220]] and she [[H1931]] will be consumed [[H398]] by fire. [[H784]] 
5 Ashkelon [[H831]] will see [[H7200]] and fear; [[H3372]] Gaza [[H5804]] will writhe in agony, [[H3966]] as will Ekron, [[H6138]] for [[H3588]] her hope [[H4007]] will wither. [[H954]] There will cease to be [[H6]] a king [[H4428]] in Gaza, [[H5804]] and Ashkelon [[H831]] will be uninhabited. [[H3808]] 
6 A mixed race [[H4464]] will occupy [[H3427]] Ashdod, [[H795]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] the pride [[H1347]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] 
7 I will remove [[H5493]] the blood [[H1818]] from their mouths [[H6310]] and the abominations [[H8251]] from between [[H996]] their teeth. [[H8127]] Then they [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] will become a remnant [[H7604]] for our God; [[H430]] they will become [[H1961]] like a clan [[H441]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and Ekron [[H6138]] will be like the Jebusites. [[H2983]] 
8 But I will camp around [[H2583]] My house [[H1004]] because of an army, [[H4675]] because of those who march to and fro, [[H5674]] and never again [[H3808]] will an oppressor [[H5065]] overrun [[H5674]] [My people], [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] I keep watch [[H7200]] with My own eyes. [[H5869]] 
9 Rejoice [[H1523]] greatly, [[H3966]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion! [[H6726]] Shout in triumph, [[H7321]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem! [[H3389]] See, [[H2009]] your King [[H4428]] comes [[H935]] to you,  righteous [[H6662]] and victorious, [[H3467]] gentle [[H6041]] and riding [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] a donkey, [[H2543]] on [[H5921]] a colt, [[H5895]] the foal [[H1121]] of a donkey. [[H860]] 
10 And I will cut off [[H3772]] the chariot [[H7393]] from Ephraim [[H669]] and the horse [[H5483]] from Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the bow [[H7198]] of war [[H4421]] will be broken. [[H3772]] Then He will proclaim [[H1696]] peace [[H7965]] to the nations; [[H1471]] His dominion will extend [[H4915]] from sea [[H3220]] to [[H5704]] sea, [[H3220]] and from the Euphrates [[H5104]] to [[H5704]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
11 As for you, [[H859]] because of the blood [[H1818]] of [My] covenant, [[H1285]] I will release [[H7971]] your prisoners [[H615]] from the waterless [[H369]] pit. [[H953]] 
12 Return [[H7725]] to your stronghold, [[H1225]] O prisoners [[H615]] of hope; [[H8615]] even [[H1571]] today [[H3117]] I declare [[H5046]] that I will restore [[H7725]] to you  double. [[H4932]] 
13 For [[H3588]] I will bend [[H1869]] Judah [[H3063]] as My bow [[H7198]] and fit it [[H4390]] with Ephraim. [[H669]] I will rouse [[H5782]] your sons, [[H1121]] O Zion, [[H6726]] against [[H5921]] the sons [[H1121]] of Greece. [[H3120]] I will make you [[H7760]] like the sword [[H2719]] of a mighty man. [[H1368]] 
14 Then the LORD [[H3068]] will appear [[H7200]] over them, [[H5921]] and His arrow [[H2671]] will go forth [[H3318]] like lightning. [[H1300]] The Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] will sound [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] and advance [[H1980]] in the whirlwinds [[H5591]] of the south. [[H8486]] 
15 The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will shield [[H1598]] them. [[H5921]] They will consume [[H398]] and conquer [[H3533]] with slingstones; [[H68]] they will drink [[H8354]] [and] roar [[H1993]] as with [[H3644]] wine. [[H3196]] And they will be filled [[H4390]] like [sacrificial] basins, [[H4219]] [drenched] like the corners [[H2106]] of the altar. [[H4196]] 
16 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] will save them [[H3467]] as the flock [[H6629]] of His people; [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] like jewels [[H68]] in a crown, [[H5145]] they will sparkle [[H5264]] over [[H5921]] His land. [[H127]] 
17 How [[H4100]] lovely they will be, [[H2898]] and how [[H4100]] beautiful! [[H3308]] Grain [[H1715]] will make the young men [[H970]] flourish, [[H5107]] and new wine, [[H8492]] the young women. [[H1330]]
