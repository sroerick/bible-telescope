# Lamentations 1
[[Jeremiah 52|←]] • [[Lamentations 2|→]]
1 How [[H349]] lonely [[H910]] lies [[H3427]] the city, [[H5892]] once so full [[H7227]] of people! [[H5971]] She who was great [[H7227]] among the nations [[H1471]] has become [[H1961]] like a widow. [[H490]] The princess [[H8282]] of the provinces [[H4082]] has become [[H1961]] a slave. [[H4522]] 
2 She weeps [[H1058]] aloud [[H1058]] in the night, [[H3915]] with tears [[H1832]] upon [[H5921]] her cheeks. [[H3895]] Among all [[H3605]] her lovers [[H157]] there is no one [[H369]] to comfort [her]. [[H5162]] All [[H3605]] her friends [[H7453]] have betrayed her; [[H898]] they have become [[H1961]] her enemies. [[H341]] 
3 Judah [[H3063]] has gone into exile [[H1540]] under affliction [[H6040]] and harsh [[H7230]] slavery; [[H5656]] she [[H1931]] dwells [[H3427]] among the nations [[H1471]] but finds [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] place to rest. [[H4494]] All [[H3605]] her pursuers [[H7291]] have overtaken her [[H5381]] in the midst [[H996]] of her distress. [[H4712]] 
4 The roads [[H1870]] to Zion [[H6726]] mourn, [[H57]] because no one [[H1097]] comes [[H935]] to her appointed feasts. [[H4150]] All [[H3605]] her gates [[H8179]] are deserted; [[H8074]] her priests [[H3548]] groan, [[H584]] her maidens [[H1330]] grieve, [[H3013]] and she herself [[H1931]] is bitter with anguish. [[H4751]] 
5 Her foes [[H6862]] have become [[H1961]] her masters; [[H7218]] her enemies [[H341]] are at ease. [[H7951]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has brought her grief [[H3013]] because of [[H5921]] her many [[H7230]] transgressions. [[H6588]] Her children [[H5768]] have gone away [[H1980]] as captives [[H7628]] before [[H6440]] the enemy. [[H6862]] 
6 All [[H3605]] the splendor [[H1926]] has departed [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the Daughter of Zion. [[H1323]] Her princes [[H8269]] are [[H1961]] like deer [[H354]] that find [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] pasture; [[H4829]] they lack [[H3808]] the strength [[H3581]] to flee [[H1980]] in the face of [[H6440]] the hunter. [[H7291]] 
7 In the days [[H3117]] of her affliction [[H6040]] and wandering [[H4788]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] remembers [[H2142]] all [[H3605]] the treasures [[H4262]] that [[H834]] were hers [[H1961]] in days [[H3117]] of old. [[H6924]] When her people [[H5971]] fell [[H5307]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the adversary, [[H6862]] she had no [[H369]] one to help. [[H5826]] Her enemies [[H6862]] looked at her, [[H7200]] laughing [[H7832]] at [[H5921]] her downfall. [[H4868]] 
8 Jerusalem [[H3389]] has sinned greatly; [[H2399]] therefore [[H5921]] she has become [[H1961]] an object of scorn. [[H5206]] All [[H3605]] who honored her [[H3513]] now despise her, [[H2107]] for [[H3588]] they have seen [[H7200]] her nakedness; [[H6172]] she [[H1931]] herself groans [[H584]] and turns [[H7725]] away. [[H268]] 
9 Her uncleanness [[H2932]] stains her skirts; [[H7757]] she did not [[H3808]] consider [[H2142]] her end. [[H319]] Her downfall [[H3381]] was astounding; [[H6382]] there was no one [[H369]] to comfort her. [[H5162]] Look, [[H7200]] O LORD, [[H3068]] on my affliction, [[H6040]] for [[H3588]] the enemy [[H341]] has triumphed! [[H1431]] 
10 The adversary [[H6862]] has seized [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] her treasures. [[H4261]] For [[H3588]] she has seen [[H7200]] the nations [[H1471]] enter [[H935]] her sanctuary— [[H4720]] those [[H834]] You had forbidden [[H6680]] to enter [[H935]] Your assembly. [[H6951]] 
11 All [[H3605]] her people [[H5971]] groan [[H584]] as they search [[H1245]] for bread. [[H3899]] They have traded [[H5414]] their treasures [[H4262]] for food [[H400]] to keep themselves alive. [[H7725]] Look, [[H7200]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and consider, [[H5027]] for [[H3588]] I have become [[H1961]] despised. [[H2151]] 
12 Is this nothing [[H3808]] to you, [[H413]] all [[H3605]] you who pass by? [[H5674]] Look around [[H5027]] and see! [[H7200]] Is there [[H3426]] any sorrow [[H4341]] like mine, [[H4341]] which [[H834]] was inflicted [[H5953]] on me,  which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] made me suffer [[H3013]] on the day [[H3117]] of His fierce [[H2740]] anger? [[H639]] 
13 He sent [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] from on high; [[H4791]] He made it seep [[H7287]] into my bones; [[H6106]] He spread [[H6566]] a net [[H7568]] for my feet [[H7272]] and turned [[H7725]] me back. [[H268]] He made [[H5414]] me desolate, [[H8076]] faint [[H1739]] all [[H3605]] the day long. [[H3117]] 
14 My transgressions [[H6588]] are bound into [[H8244]] a yoke, [[H5923]] knit together [[H8276]] by His hand; [[H3027]] they have come [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] my neck, [[H6677]] and the Lord [[H136]] has broken [[H3782]] my strength. [[H3581]] He has handed me over [[H5414]] to those I cannot [[H3808]] withstand. [[H6965]] 
15 The Lord [[H136]] has rejected [[H5541]] all [[H3605]] the warriors [[H47]] in my midst; [[H7130]] He has summoned [[H7121]] an army [[H4150]] against me [[H5921]] to crush [[H7665]] my young warriors. [[H970]] Like grapes in a winepress [[H1660]] the Lord [[H136]] has trampled [[H1869]] the Virgin [[H1330]] Daughter [[H1323]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
16 For [[H5921]] these things [[H428]] I [[H589]] weep; [[H1058]] my eyes [[H5869]] flow [[H3381]] with tears. [[H4325]] For [[H3588]] there is no one nearby [[H7368]] to comfort me, [[H5162]] no one to revive [[H7725]] my soul. [[H5315]] My children [[H1121]] are [[H1961]] destitute [[H8074]] because [[H3588]] the enemy [[H341]] has prevailed. [[H1396]] 
17 Zion [[H6726]] stretches out [[H6566]] her hands, [[H3027]] but there is no [[H369]] one to comfort her. [[H5162]] The LORD [[H3068]] has decreed [[H6680]] against Jacob [[H3290]] that his neighbors [[H5439]] become his foes. [[H6862]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] has become [[H1961]] an unclean thing [[H5079]] among them. [[H996]] 
18 The LORD [[H3069]] is righteous, [[H6662]] for [[H3588]] I have rebelled [[H4784]] against His command. [[H6310]] Listen, [[H8085]] all you people; [[H3605]] look upon [[H7200]] my suffering. [[H4341]] My young men [[H970]] and maidens [[H1330]] have gone [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]] 
19 I called out [[H7121]] to my lovers, [[H157]] but they [[H1992]] have betrayed me. [[H7411]] My priests [[H3548]] and elders [[H2205]] perished [[H1478]] in the city [[H5892]] while [[H3588]] they searched for [[H1245]] food [[H400]] to keep themselves alive. [[H7725]] 
20 Behold, [[H7200]] O LORD, [[H3068]] how [[H3588]] distressed I am. [[H6862]] I am churning [[H2560]] within; [[H4578]] my heart [[H3820]] is overturned, [[H2015]] for [[H3588]] I have been most rebellious. [[H4784]] Outside, [[H2351]] the sword [[H2719]] bereaves; [[H7921]] inside, [[H1004]] there is death. [[H4194]] 
21 People have heard [[H8085]] my [[H589]] groaning, [[H584]] but there is no [[H369]] one to comfort me. [[H5162]] All [[H3605]] my enemies [[H341]] have heard [[H8085]] of my trouble; [[H7451]] they are glad [[H7797]] that [[H3588]] You [[H859]] have caused it. [[H6213]] May You bring [[H935]] the day [[H3117]] You have announced, [[H7121]] so that they may become [[H1961]] like me. [[H3644]] 
22 Let all [[H3605]] their wickedness [[H7451]] come [[H935]] before You, [[H6440]] and deal with them [[H5953]] as [[H834]] You have dealt with me [[H5953]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] my transgressions. [[H6588]] For [[H3588]] my groans [[H585]] are many, [[H7227]] and my heart [[H3820]] is faint. [[H1742]]
