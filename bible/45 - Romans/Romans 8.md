1 Therefore, [[G686]] [there is] now [[G3568]] no [[G3762]] condemnation [[G2631]] for those who [are] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
2 For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] has set you [[G1659]] [free] [[G4771]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of sin [[G266]] and [[G2532]] death. [[G2288]] 
3 For [[G1063]] what [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] was powerless to do [[G102]] in [[G1722]] that [[G3739]] it was weakened [[G770]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] God [did] [[G2316]] by sending [[G3992]] His [[G1438]] [own] [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] [the] likeness [[G3667]] of sinful [[G266]] man, [[G4561]] [ as an offering ] for [[G4012]] sin. [[G266]] He [thus] condemned [[G2632]] sin [[G266]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] 
4 so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] righteous standard [[G1345]] of the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] might be fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G1473]] who [[G3588]] {do} not [[G3361]] live [[G4043]] according to [[G2596]] [the] flesh [[G4561]] but [[G235]] according to [[G2596]] [the] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
5 Those [[G3588]] who live [[G1510]] according to [[G2596]] [the] flesh [[G4561]] set their minds [[G5426]] on the things [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] flesh; [[G4561]] but [[G1161]] those [who live] [[G3588]] according to [[G2596]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] [set their minds on] the things [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
6 The [[G3588]] mind [[G5427]] of the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] [is] death, [[G2288]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] mind [[G5427]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] [is] life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] peace, [[G1515]] 
7 because [[G1360]] the [[G3588]] mind [[G5427]] of the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] [is] hostile [[G2189]] to [[G1519]] God: [[G2316]] It does not submit [[G5293]] to [[G3588]] God’s [[G2316]] Law, [[G3551]] nor [[G3761]] can it [do so]. [[G1410]] 
8 Those [[G3588]] controlled by [[G1722]] [the] flesh [[G4561]] cannot [[G1410]] please [[G700]] God. [[G2316]] 
9 You, [[G4771]] however, [[G1161]] are [[G1510]] controlled not by [[G1722]] [the] flesh, [[G4561]] but [[G235]] by [[G1722]] [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] if [[G1512]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of God [[G2316]] lives [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] {does} not [[G3756]] have [[G2192]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of Christ, [[G5547]] he [[G3778]] {does} not [[G3756]] belong [[G1510]] to [Christ]. [[G846]] 
10 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] Christ [[G5547]] [is] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] [your] [[G3588]] body [is] [[G4983]] dead [[G3498]] because of [[G1223]] sin, [[G266]] yet [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] [gives you] life [[G2222]] because of [[G1223]] righteousness. [[G1343]] 
11 And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of Him [[G3588]] who raised [[G1453]] Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead [[G3498]] lives [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] He who [[G3588]] raised [[G1453]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead [[G3498]] will also give life [[G2227]] to your [[G4771]] mortal [[G2349]] bodies [[G4983]] through [[G1223]] His [[G846]] Spirit, [[G4151]] who [[G3588]] dwells [[G1774]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] 
12 Therefore, [[G686]] brothers, [[G80]] we have [[G1510]] [an] obligation, [[G3781]] [but it is] not [[G3756]] to the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] to live [[G2198]] according to [[G2596]] [it]. [[G4561]] 
13 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] you live [[G2198]] according to [[G2596]] [the] flesh, [[G4561]] you will [[G3195]] die; [[G599]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] by [the] Spirit [[G4151]] you put to death [[G2289]] the [[G3588]] deeds [[G4234]] of the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] you will live. [[G2198]] 
14 For [[G1063]] all who [[G3745]] are led [[G71]] by [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of God [[G2316]] are [[G1510]] sons [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]] 
15 For [[G1063]] you did not receive [[G2983]] a spirit [[G4151]] of slavery [[G1397]] that returns you [[G3825]] to [[G1519]] fear, [[G5401]] but [[G235]] you received [[G2983]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of sonship, [[G5206]] by [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] we cry, [[G2896]] “Abba! [[G5]] Father!” [[G3962]] 
16 The [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] Himself [[G846]] testifies with [[G4828]] our [[G1473]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] children. [[G5043]] 
17 And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] [we are] children, [[G5043]] then [[G2532]] [we are] heirs: [[G2818]] heirs [[G2818]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] co-heirs [[G4789]] with Christ— [[G5547]] if indeed [[G1512]] we suffer with [Him], [[G4841]] so that [[G2443]] we may also be glorified with [Him]. [[G4888]] 
18 I consider [[G3049]] that [[G3754]] [our] [[G3588]] present [[G3568]] sufferings [[G3804]] [are] not [[G3756]] comparable [[G514]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] that will be [[G3195]] revealed [[G601]] in [[G1519]] us. [[G1473]] 
19 The [[G3588]] creation [[G2937]] waits [[G553]] in eager expectation [[G603]] for the [[G3588]] revelation [[G602]] of the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]] 
20 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] creation [[G2937]] was subjected [[G5293]] to [[G3588]] futility, [[G3153]] not [[G3756]] by its own will, [[G1635]] but [[G235]] because of [[G1223]] the [One who] [[G3588]] subjected [it], [[G5293]] in [[G1909]] hope [[G1680]] 
21 that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] creation [[G2937]] itself [[G846]] will be set free [[G1659]] from [[G575]] [its] [[G3588]] bondage [[G1397]] to decay [[G5356]] [and brought] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] glorious [[G1391]] freedom [[G1657]] of the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of God. [[G2316]] 
22 We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] creation [[G2937]] has been groaning together [[G4959]] in the pains of childbirth [[G4944]] until [[G891]] the present time. [[G3568]] 
23 Not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] that, [[G1161]] but [[G235]] we [[G1473]] ourselves, [[G846]] who have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] firstfruits [[G536]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] groan [[G4727]] inwardly [[G846]] as we wait eagerly for [[G553]] [our] adoption as sons, [[G5206]] the [[G3588]] redemption [[G629]] of our [[G1473]] bodies. [[G4983]] 
24 For [[G1063]] in this [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] we were saved; [[G4982]] but [[G1161]] hope [[G1680]] that is seen [[G991]] is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] hope [at all]. [[G1680]] [Who] [[G5101]] hopes for [[G1679]] what [[G3739]] he can already see? [[G991]] 
25 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] we hope for [[G1679]] what [[G3739]] we do not yet see, [[G991]] we wait for [it] [[G553]] patiently. [[G5281]] 
26 In the same way, [[G5615]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] helps us [[G4878]] in our [[G1473]] weakness. [[G769]] For [[G1063]] we do not know [[G1492]] how [[G5101]] we ought [[G1163]] to pray, [[G4336]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] Himself [[G846]] intercedes [for us] [[G5241]] with groans [[G4726]] too deep for words. [[G215]] 
27 And [[G1161]] He who [[G3588]] searches [[G2045]] [our] [[G3588]] hearts [[G2588]] knows [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] mind [[G5427]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] because [[G3754]] [the Spirit] intercedes [[G1793]] for [[G5228]] [the] saints [[G40]] according to [the will] [[G2596]] [of] God. [[G2316]] 
28 And [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] works all things together [[G4903]] for [[G1519]] [the] good [[G18]] of those who [[G3588]] love [[G25]] [Him], [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] are [[G1510]] called [[G2822]] according to [[G2596]] [His] purpose. [[G4286]] 
29 For [[G3754]] those [[G3739]] [God] foreknew, [[G4267]] He also predestined [to be] [[G4309]] conformed to [[G4832]] the [[G3588]] image [[G1504]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] so that [[G1519]] He [[G846]] would be [[G1510]] [the] firstborn [[G4416]] among [[G1722]] many [[G4183]] brothers. [[G80]] 
30 And [[G1161]] those [[G3739]] He predestined [[G4309]] He also called; [[G2564]] [those] [[G3739]] He called [[G2564]] He [also] justified; [[G1344]] [those] [[G3739]] He justified [[G1344]] He also glorified. [[G1392]] 
31 What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] shall we say [[G2046]] in response to [[G4314]] these things? [[G3778]] If [[G1487]] God [is] [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] us, [[G1473]] who [can be] [[G5101]] against [[G2596]] us? [[G1473]] 
32 He who [[G3739]] did not spare [[G5339]] [His] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] Son [[G5207]] but [[G235]] gave [[G3860]] Him up [[G846]] for [[G5228]] us [[G1473]] all, [[G3956]] how [[G4459]] {will He} not [[G3780]] also, [[G2532]] along with [[G4862]] Him, [[G846]] freely give [[G5483]] us [[G1473]] all [[G3956]] things? [[G3588]] 
33 Who [[G5101]] will bring any charge [[G1458]] against [[G2596]] God’s [[G2316]] elect? [[G1588]] [It is] God [[G2316]] [who] [[G3588]] justifies. [[G1344]] 
34 Who [is] [[G5101]] there [[G3588]] to condemn [us]? [[G2632]] [For] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] died, [[G599]] and [[G1161]] more than that [[G3123]] was raised to life, [[G1453]] is [[G1510]] at [[G1722]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of God— [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] He is interceding [[G1793]] for [[G5228]] us. [[G1473]] 
35 Who [[G5101]] shall separate [[G5563]] us [[G1473]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of Christ? [[G5547]] {Shall} trouble [[G2347]] or [[G2228]] distress [[G4730]] or [[G2228]] persecution [[G1375]] or [[G2228]] famine [[G3042]] or [[G2228]] nakedness [[G1132]] or [[G2228]] danger [[G2794]] or [[G2228]] sword? [[G3162]] 
36 As [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “For Your sake [[G1752]] we face death [[G2289]] all [[G3650]] day long; [[G2250]] we are considered [[G3049]] as [[G5613]] sheep [[G4263]] to be slaughtered.” [[G4967]] 
37 No, [[G235]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G3778]] we are more than conquerors [[G5245]] through [[G1223]] Him who [[G3588]] loved [[G25]] us. [[G1473]] 
38 For [[G1063]] I am convinced [[G3982]] that [[G3754]] neither [[G3777]] death [[G2288]] nor [[G3777]] life, [[G2222]] neither [[G3777]] angels [[G32]] nor [[G3777]] principalities, [[G746]] neither [[G3777]] the present [[G1764]] nor [[G3777]] the future, [[G3195]] nor [[G3777]] any powers, [[G1411]] 
39 neither [[G3777]] height [[G5313]] nor [[G3777]] depth, [[G899]] nor [[G3777]] anything [[G5100]] else [[G2087]] in all creation, [[G2937]] will be able [[G1410]] to separate [[G5563]] us [[G1473]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of God [[G2316]] that [is] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord. [[G2962]]
