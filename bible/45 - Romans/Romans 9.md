[[Romans 8|←]] • [[Romans 10|→]]
1 I speak [[G3004]] [the] truth [[G225]] in [[G1722]] Christ; [[G5547]] I am not lying, [[G5574]] as confirmed [[G4828]] by my [[G1473]] conscience [[G4893]] in [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
2 I [[G1473]] have [[G1510]] deep [[G3173]] sorrow [[G3077]] and [[G2532]] unceasing [[G88]] anguish [[G3601]] in [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] heart. [[G2588]] 
3 For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] could wish that [[G2172]] I myself [[G846]] were [[G1510]] cursed [[G331]] [and] cut off from [[G575]] Christ [[G5547]] for the sake of [[G5228]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] my [[G1473]] own flesh and blood, [[G4773]] 
4 [the people of] [[G3748]] Israel. [[G2475]] [Theirs is] [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] adoption as sons; [[G5206]] [theirs] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] divine glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] covenants; [[G1242]] [theirs] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] giving of the Law, [[G3548]] the [[G3588]] temple worship, [[G2999]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] promises. [[G1860]] 
5 [Theirs are] [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] patriarchs, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] them [ proceeds ] [[G3739]] [the] human [descent] [[G4561]] of Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] God [[G2316]] over [[G1909]] all, [[G3956]] forever [[G165]] worthy of praise! [[G2128]] Amen. [[G281]] 
6 [It is] not [[G3756]] as though [[G3634]] God’s [[G2316]] word [[G3056]] has failed. [[G1601]] For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] who [are] [[G3588]] descended from [[G1537]] Israel [[G2474]] [are] [[G3778]] Israel. [[G2474]] 
7 Nor [[G3761]] because [[G3754]] they are [[G1510]] Abraham’s [[G11]] descendants [[G4690]] [are] they all [[G3956]] [his] children. [[G5043]] On the contrary, [[G235]] “Through [[G1722]] Isaac [[G2464]] your [[G4771]] offspring [[G4690]] will be reckoned.” [[G2564]] 
8 So [[G3778]] it is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] [who are] [[G3778]] God’s [[G2316]] children, [[G5043]] but [it is] [[G235]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] who are regarded [[G3049]] as [[G1519]] offspring. [[G4690]] 
9 For [[G1063]] this [is] [[G3778]] what [[G3588]] [the] promise [[G1860]] stated: [[G3056]] “At [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] appointed time [[G2540]] I will return, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] Sarah [[G4564]] will have [[G1510]] a son.” [[G5207]] 
10 Not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] that, [[G1161]] but [[G235]] Rebecca’s [children] [[G4479]] were [[G2192]] conceived [[G2845]] by [[G1537]] one [man], [[G1520]] our [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] Isaac. [[G2464]] 
11 Yet [[G1063]] before [the twins] [[G3380]] were born [[G1080]] [or] [[G3366]] had done [[G4238]] anything [[G5100]] good [[G18]] or [[G2228]] bad, [[G5337]] in order that [[G2443]] God’s [[G2316]] plan [[G4286]] of [[G2596]] election [[G1589]] might stand, [[G3306]] 
12 not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] works [[G2041]] but [[G235]] by [[G1537]] Him who [[G3588]] calls, [[G2564]] she [[G846]] was told, [[G2046]] “The [[G3588]] older [[G3173]] will serve [[G1398]] the [[G3588]] younger.” [[G1640]] 
13 So [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “Jacob [[G2384]] I loved, [[G25]] but [[G1161]] Esau [[G2269]] I hated.” [[G3404]] 
14 What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] shall we say? [[G2046]] [Is] [[G3361]] God [[G2316]] unjust? [[G93]] Absolutely not! [[G1096]] 
15 For [[G1063]] He says [[G3004]] to [[G3588]] Moses: [[G3475]] “I will have mercy on [[G1653]] whom [[G3739]] I have mercy, [[G1653]] and [[G2532]] I will have compassion on [[G3627]] whom [[G3739]] I have compassion.” [[G3627]] 
16 So [[G686]] then, [[G3767]] [it does] not [depend] [[G3756]] on man’s [[G3588]] desire [[G2309]] [or] [[G3761]] effort, [[G5143]] but [[G235]] on [[G3588]] God’s [[G2316]] mercy. [[G1653]] 
17 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] says [[G3004]] to [[G3588]] Pharaoh: [[G5328]] “I raised you up [[G1825]] for [[G1519]] this very [[G846]] [purpose], [[G3778]] that [[G3704]] I might display [[G1731]] My [[G1473]] power [[G1411]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3704]] My [[G1473]] name [[G3686]] might be proclaimed [[G1229]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] 
18 Therefore [[G686]] [God] has mercy [[G1653]] on whom [[G3739]] He wants [to have mercy ], [[G2309]] and [[G1161]] He hardens [[G4645]] whom [[G3739]] He wants [ to harden ]. [[G2309]] 
19 One of you will say [[G2046]] to me, [[G1473]] “Then [[G3767]] why [[G5101]] does [God] still find fault? [[G3201]] For [[G1063]] who [[G5101]] can resist [[G436]] His [[G846]] will?” [[G1013]] 
20 But [[G3304]] who [[G5101]] are you, [[G1510]] O [[G5599]] man, [[G444]] to talk back [[G470]] to God? [[G2316]] [Shall] [[G3361]] what [[G3588]] is formed [[G4110]] say [[G2046]] to Him who [[G3588]] formed [it], [[G4111]] “Why [[G5101]] have you made [[G4160]] me [[G1473]] like this?” [[G3779]] 
21 {Does} not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] potter [[G2763]] have [[G2192]] the right [[G1849]] to make [[G4160]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] lump [[G5445]] of clay [[G4081]] one [[G3739]] vessel [[G4632]] for [[G1519]] special occasions [[G5092]] and [[G1161]] [another] [[G3739]] for [[G1519]] common use? [[G819]] 
22 What if [[G1487]] God, [[G2316]] intending [[G2309]] to show [[G1731]] [His] [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] and [[G2532]] make [[G1107]] His [[G846]] power {known}, [[G1415]] bore [[G5342]] with [[G1722]] great [[G4183]] patience [[G3115]] [the] vessels [[G4632]] of His wrath, [[G3709]] prepared [[G2675]] for [[G1519]] destruction? [[G684]] 
23 [What if He did this] [[G2532]] to [[G2443]] make [[G1107]] the [[G3588]] riches [[G4149]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] glory {known} [[G1391]] to [[G1909]] [the] vessels [[G4632]] of [His] mercy, [[G1656]] whom [[G3739]] He prepared in advance [[G4282]] for [[G1519]] glory— [[G1391]] 
24 including [[G2532]] us, [[G1473]] whom [[G3739]] He has called [[G2564]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] from [[G1537]] [the] Jews, [[G2453]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] [the] Gentiles? [[G1484]] 
25 As [[G5613]] He says [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] Hosea: [[G5617]] “I will call [them] [[G2564]] My [[G1473]] people [[G2992]] who [are] [[G3588]] not [[G3756]] My [[G1473]] people, [[G2992]] and [I will call her] [[G2532]] [My] beloved [[G25]] who [is] [[G3588]] not [[G3756]] [My] beloved,” [[G25]] 
26 and, [[G2532]] “It will happen that [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] very place [[G5117]] where [[G3739]] it was said [[G2046]] to them, [[G846]] ‘You [[G4771]] [are] not [[G3756]] My [[G1473]] people,’ [[G2992]] they will be called [[G2564]] ‘sons [[G5207]] of [the] living [[G2198]] God.’” [[G2316]] 
27 Isaiah [[G2268]] cries out [[G2896]] concerning [[G5228]] Israel: [[G2474]] “Though [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of the [[G3588]] Israelites [[G2474]] is [[G1510]] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sand [[G285]] of the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] [only] the [[G3588]] remnant [[G5275]] will be saved. [[G4982]] 
28 For [[G1063]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] will carry out [[G4160]] [His] sentence [[G3056]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] thoroughly [[G4931]] and [[G2532]] decisively.” [[G4932]] 
29 [It is] just as [[G2531]] Isaiah [[G2268]] predicted: [[G4302]] “Unless [[G1487]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] of Hosts [[G4519]] had left [[G1459]] us [[G1473]] descendants, [[G4690]] we would have become [[G1096]] like [[G5613]] Sodom, [[G4670]] we would have resembled [[G3666]] Gomorrah.” [[G1116]] 
30 What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] will we say? [[G2046]] That [[G3754]] [the] Gentiles, [[G1484]] who [[G3588]] did not pursue [[G1377]] righteousness, [[G1343]] have obtained [[G2638]] [it], [[G1343]] a righteousness [[G1343]] that [is] [[G3588]] by [[G1537]] faith; [[G4102]] 
31 but [[G1161]] Israel, [[G2474]] who pursued [[G1377]] a law [[G3551]] of righteousness, [[G1343]] has not attained [[G5348]] [it]. [[G3551]] 
32 Why [not]? [[G1223]] Because [their pursuit was] [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] but [[G235]] as if [it were] [[G5613]] by [[G1537]] works. [[G2041]] They stumbled [[G4350]] over the [[G3588]] stumbling [[G4348]] stone, [[G3037]] 
33 as [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “See, [[G2400]] I lay [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] Zion [[G4622]] a stone [[G3037]] of stumbling, [[G4348]] and [[G2532]] a rock [[G4073]] of offense; [[G4625]] and [[G2532]] the [one who] [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] Him [[G846]] will never be put to shame.” [[G2617]]
