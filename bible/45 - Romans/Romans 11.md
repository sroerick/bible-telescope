1 I ask [[G3004]] then, [[G3767]] {did} God [[G2316]] reject [[G683]] His [[G846]] people? [[G2992]] Absolutely not! [[G1096]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] an Israelite [[G2475]] [myself], [[G2532]] a descendant [[G4690]] of Abraham, [[G11]] from [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Benjamin. [[G958]] 
2 God [[G2316]] did not reject [[G683]] His [[G846]] people, [[G2992]] whom [[G3739]] He foreknew. [[G4267]] Do you not know [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] says [[G3004]] about [[G1722]] Elijah, [[G2243]] how [[G5613]] he appealed [[G1793]] to God [[G2316]] against [[G2596]] Israel: [[G2474]] 
3 “Lord, [[G2962]] they have killed [[G615]] Your [[G4771]] prophets [[G4396]] [and] torn down [[G2679]] Your [[G4771]] altars. [[G2379]] I [[G2504]] [am] the only one [[G3441]] left, [[G5275]] and [[G2532]] they are seeking [[G2212]] my [[G1473]] life [ as well ]”? [[G5590]] 
4 [And] [[G235]] what [was] [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] divine reply [[G5538]] to him? [[G846]] “I have reserved [[G2641]] for Myself [[G1683]] seven thousand [[G2035]] men [[G435]] who [[G3748]] {have} not [[G3756]] bowed [[G2578]] [the] knee [[G1119]] to Baal.” [[G896]] 
5 In the same way, [[G3779]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] present [[G3568]] time [[G2540]] there is [[G1096]] a remnant [[G3005]] chosen by [[G1589]] grace. [[G5485]] 
6 And [[G1161]] if [it is] [[G1487]] by grace, [[G5485]] [then it is] no longer [[G3765]] by [[G1537]] works. [[G2041]] Otherwise, [[G1893]] grace [[G5485]] {would} no longer [[G3765]] be [[G1096]] grace. [[G5485]] 
7 What [[G5101]] then? [[G3767]] What [[G3739]] Israel [[G2474]] was seeking, [[G1934]] it failed to obtain, [[G2013]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] elect [[G1589]] [did]. [[G2013]] The [[G3588]] others [[G3062]] were hardened, [[G4456]] 
8 as [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “God [[G2316]] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] a spirit [[G4151]] of stupor, [[G2659]] eyes [[G3788]] that [[G3588]] could not see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] ears [[G3775]] that [[G3588]] could not hear, [[G191]] to [[G2193]] this very day.” [[G4594]] 
9 And [[G2532]] David [[G1138]] says: [[G3004]] “{May} their [[G846]] table [[G5132]] become [[G1096]] a snare [[G3803]] and [[G2532]] a trap, [[G2339]] a stumbling block [[G4625]] and [[G2532]] a retribution [[G468]] to them. [[G846]] 
10 {May} their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] be darkened [[G4654]] [so] they cannot see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] backs [[G3577]] be bent [[G4781]] forever.” [[G3956]] 
11 I ask [[G3004]] then, [[G3767]] did they stumble [[G4417]] so as [[G2443]] to lose their share? [[G4098]] Absolutely not! [[G1096]] However, [[G235]] because of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] trespass, [[G3900]] salvation [has come] [[G4991]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] to [[G1519]] make [Israel] jealous. [[G3863]] 
12 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] their [[G846]] trespass [[G3900]] [means] riches [[G4149]] for [the] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] failure [[G2275]] [means] riches [[G4149]] for [the] Gentiles, [[G1484]] how much [[G4214]] greater [ riches ] [[G3123]] {will} their [[G846]] fullness [bring]! [[G4138]] 
13 I am speaking [[G3004]] to you [[G4771]] Gentiles. [[G1484]] Inasmuch [[G1909]] {as} I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] [the] apostle [[G652]] to [the] Gentiles, [[G1484]] I magnify [[G1392]] my [[G1473]] ministry, [[G1248]] 
14 in the hope that [[G1487]] I may provoke [[G3863]] my [[G1473]] [own] [[G3588]] people {to jealousy} [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] save [[G4982]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them. [[G846]] 
15 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] their [[G846]] rejection [[G580]] [is the] reconciliation [[G2643]] of [the] world, [[G2889]] what [[G5101]] [will their] [[G3588]] acceptance [be] [[G4356]] but [[G1487]] life [[G2222]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead? [[G3498]] 
16 If [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] first part [of the dough] [[G536]] [is] holy, [[G40]] so [is] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole batch; [[G5445]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] root [[G4491]] [is] holy, [[G40]] so [are] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] branches. [[G2798]] 
17 Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] some [[G5100]] branches [[G2798]] have been broken off, [[G1575]] and [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] a wild olive shoot, [[G65]] have been grafted in [[G1461]] among [[G1722]] [the others] [[G846]] to share [[G4791]] in the [[G3588]] nourishment [[G4096]] of the [[G3588]] olive [[G1636]] root, [[G4491]] 
18 {do} not [[G3361]] boast over [[G2620]] those [[G3588]] branches. [[G2798]] If [[G1487]] [you do, remember this]: [[G2620]] You [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3756]] support [[G941]] the [[G3588]] root, [[G4491]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] root [ supports ] [[G4491]] you. [[G4771]] 
19 You will say [[G2046]] then, [[G3767]] “Branches [[G2798]] were broken off [[G1575]] so that [[G2443]] I [[G1473]] could be grafted in.” [[G1461]] 
20 That is correct: [[G2573]] They were broken off [[G1575]] because of [[G3588]] unbelief, [[G570]] but [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] stand [[G2476]] by faith. [[G4102]] {Do} not [[G3361]] be arrogant, [[G5308]] but [[G235]] be afraid. [[G5399]] 
21 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] {did} not [[G3756]] spare [[G5339]] the [[G3588]] natural [[G5449]] branches, [[G2798]] He will [not] spare [[G5339]] you [[G4771]] [either]. [[G3761]] 
22 Take notice, [[G2400]] therefore, [[G3767]] [of the] kindness [[G5544]] and [[G2532]] severity [[G663]] of God: [[G2316]] severity [[G663]] to [[G1909]] those who [[G3588]] fell, [[G4098]] but [[G1161]] kindness [[G5544]] to [[G1909]] you, [[G4771]] if [[G1437]] you continue in [[G1961]] [His] [[G3588]] kindness. [[G5544]] Otherwise [[G1893]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] will be cut off. [[G1581]] 
23 And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] they [[G2548]] do not persist [[G1961]] in unbelief, [[G570]] they will be grafted in, [[G1461]] for [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] able [[G1415]] to graft [[G1461]] them {in} [[G846]] again. [[G3825]] 
24 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] you [[G4771]] were cut [[G1581]] from [[G1537]] a wild olive tree, [[G65]] and [[G2532]] contrary to [[G3844]] nature [[G5449]] were grafted [[G1461]] into [[G1519]] [one that is] cultivated, [[G2565]] how much [[G4214]] more [ readily ] [[G3123]] {will} these, [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] natural [branches], [[G5449]] be grafted into [[G1461]] [their] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] olive tree! [[G1636]] 
25 I do not want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be ignorant [[G50]] of this [[G3778]] mystery, [[G3466]] brothers, [[G80]] so that [[G2443]] you will not be [[G1510]] conceited: [[G5429]] A hardening [[G4457]] in [[G575]] part [[G3313]] has come [[G1096]] to Israel, [[G2474]] until [[G891]] the [[G3588]] full number [[G4138]] of the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] has come in. [[G1525]] 
26 And [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] all [[G3956]] Israel [[G2474]] will be saved, [[G4982]] as [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “The [[G3588]] Deliverer [[G4506]] will come [[G2240]] from [[G1537]] Zion; [[G4622]] He will remove [[G654]] godlessness [[G763]] from [[G575]] Jacob. [[G2384]] 
27 And [[G2532]] this [is] [[G3778]] My [[G1473]] covenant [[G1242]] with them [[G846]] when [[G3752]] I take away [[G851]] their [[G846]] sins.” [[G266]] 
28 Regarding [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] [they are] enemies [[G2190]] on your account; [[G1223]] but [[G1161]] regarding [[G2596]] election, [[G1589]] [they are] loved [[G27]] on account of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] patriarchs. [[G3962]] 
29 For [[G1063]] God’s [[G2316]] gifts [[G5486]] and [[G2532]] [His] [[G3588]] call [[G2821]] [are] irrevocable. [[G278]] 
30 Just as [[G5618]] you [who] [[G4771]] formerly [[G4218]] disobeyed [[G544]] God [[G2316]] have now received mercy [[G1653]] through their [[G3778]] disobedience, [[G543]] 
31 so [[G3779]] they [[G3778]] too [[G2532]] have now disobeyed, [[G544]] in order that [[G2443]] they [[G846]] too [[G2532]] may now receive mercy [[G1653]] through the [[G3588]] mercy [[G1656]] [shown to] you. [[G5212]] 
32 For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] has consigned [[G4788]] all [men] [[G3956]] to [[G1519]] disobedience [[G543]] so that [[G2443]] He may have mercy on [[G1653]] them all. [[G3956]] 
33 O, [[G5599]] [the] depth [[G899]] of [the] riches [[G4149]] of [the] wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] knowledge [[G1108]] of God! [[G2316]] How [[G5613]] unsearchable [[G419]] His [[G846]] judgments, [[G2917]] and [[G2532]] untraceable [[G421]] His [[G846]] ways! [[G3598]] 
34 “Who [[G5101]] has known [[G1097]] [the] mind [[G3563]] of [the] Lord? [[G2962]] Or [[G2228]] who [[G5101]] has been [[G1096]] His [[G846]] counselor?” [[G4825]] 
35 “Who [[G5101]] has first given [[G4272]] to God, [[G846]] that [[G2532]] God should repay [[G467]] him?” [[G846]] 
36 For [[G3754]] from [[G1537]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] Him [[G846]] [are] all things. [[G3956]] To Him [be] [[G846]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] forever! [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]
