[[G4869]] [They] [[G3748]] are [[G1510]] distinguished [[G1978]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] apostles, [[G652]] and [[G2532]] [they] [[G3739]] were [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] before [[G4253]] I [was]. [[G1473]]

11 Greet [[G782]] Herodion, [[G2267]] my [[G1473]] fellow countryman. [[G4773]] Greet [[G782]] those [[G3588]] from [[G1537]] the [household] [[G3588]] of Narcissus [[G3488]] who [[G3588]] are [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
12 Greet [[G782]] Tryphena [[G5170]] and [[G2532]] Tryphosa, [[G5173]] [ women ] who [[G3588]] have worked hard [[G2872]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] Greet [[G782]] [my] [[G3588]] beloved [[G27]] Persis, [[G4069]] who [[G3748]] has worked [[G2872]] very hard [[G4183]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
13 Greet [[G782]] Rufus, [[G4504]] chosen [[G1588]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] [who has been a mother] to me [[G1473]] as well. [[G2532]] 
14 Greet [[G782]] Asyncritus, [[G799]] Phlegon, [[G5393]] Hermes, [[G2060]] Patrobas, [[G3969]] Hermas, [[G2057]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]] 
15 Greet [[G782]] Philologus [[G5378]] and [[G2532]] Julia, [[G2456]] Nereus [[G3517]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] sister, [[G79]] and [[G2532]] Olympas [[G3652]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]] 
16 Greet [[G782]] one another [[G240]] with [[G1722]] a holy [[G40]] kiss. [[G5370]] All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] of Christ [[G5547]] send you greetings. [[G782]] 
17 Now [[G1161]] I urge [[G3870]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] to watch out for [[G4648]] those who [[G3588]] create [[G4160]] divisions [[G1370]] and [[G2532]] obstacles [that are] [[G4625]] contrary to [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] teaching [[G1322]] you [[G4771]] have learned. [[G3129]] Turn away [[G1578]] from [[G575]] them. [[G846]] 
18 For [[G1063]] such people [[G5108]] {are} not [[G3756]] serving [[G1398]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Christ, [[G5547]] but [[G235]] their [[G1438]] [own] [[G3588]] appetites. [[G2836]] By [[G1223]] smooth talk [[G5542]] and [[G2532]] flattery [[G2129]] they deceive [[G1818]] the [[G3588]] hearts [[G2588]] of the [[G3588]] naive. [[G172]] 
19 Everyone [[G3956]] [has heard] [[G864]] about your [[G4771]] obedience, [[G5218]] so [[G3767]] I rejoice [[G5463]] over [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]] But [[G1161]] I want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be [[G1510]] wise [[G4680]] about [[G1519]] what [is] [[G3588]] good [[G18]] and [[G1161]] innocent [[G185]] about [[G1519]] what [is] [[G3588]] evil. [[G2556]] 
20 The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of peace [[G1515]] will soon crush [[G4937]] Satan [[G4567]] under [[G5259]] your [[G4771]] feet. [[G4228]] The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [be] with [[G3326]] you. [[G4771]] 
21 Timothy, [[G5095]] my [[G1473]] fellow worker, [[G4904]] sends you greetings, [[G782]] as do [[G2532]] Lucius, [[G3066]] Jason, [[G2394]] and [[G2532]] Sosipater, [[G4989]] my [[G1473]] fellow countrymen. [[G4773]] 
22 I, [[G1473]] Tertius, [[G5060]] who [[G3588]] wrote down [[G1125]] this [[G3588]] letter, [[G1992]] greet [[G782]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
23 Gaius, [[G1050]] who [[G3588]] has hosted [[G3581]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] sends you greetings. [[G782]] Erastus, [[G2037]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] treasurer, [[G3623]] sends you greetings, [[G782]] [as does] [[G2532]] [our] [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] Quartus. [[G2890]] 
24 The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] our [[G1473]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [be] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] all. [[G3956]] Amen. [[G281]] 
25 Now [[G1161]] to Him who [[G3588]] is able [[G1410]] to strengthen [[G4741]] you [[G4771]] by [[G2596]] my [[G1473]] gospel [[G2098]] and [[G2532]] by the [[G3588]] proclamation [[G2782]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] according to [[G2596]] [the] revelation [[G602]] of [the] mystery [[G3466]] concealed [[G4601]] for ages past, [[G166]] 
26 but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] revealed [[G5319]] [and] made known [[G1107]] through [[G5037]] the writings [[G1124]] of the prophets [[G4397]] by [[G2596]] [the] command [[G2003]] of the [[G3588]] eternal [[G166]] God, [[G2316]] in order to lead [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] to the [[G1519]] obedience [[G5218]] [that comes from] faith— [[G4102]] 
27 [to the] only [[G3441]] wise [[G4680]] God [[G2316]] [be] [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] forever [[G165]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ! [[G5547]] Amen. [[G281]]
