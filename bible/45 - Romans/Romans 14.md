1 Accept [[G4355]] him whose [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] is weak, [[G770]] without [[G3361]] passing judgment [[G1253]] on [his] opinions. [[G1261]] 
2 For [[G3303]] one [man] [[G3739]] has faith [[G4100]] to eat [[G5315]] all things, [[G3956]] while [[G1161]] another, [[G3588]] who is weak, [[G770]] eats [[G2068]] [only] vegetables. [[G3001]] 
3 The [one who] [[G3588]] eats [everything] [[G2068]] must not belittle [[G1848]] the [one who] [[G3588]] [does not], [[G2068]] and [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] does not eat [everything] [[G2068]] must not judge [[G2919]] the [one who] [[G3588]] [does], [[G2068]] for [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] has accepted [[G4355]] him. [[G846]] 
4 Who [[G5101]] are [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] to judge [[G2919]] someone else’s [[G245]] servant? [[G3610]] To [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] master [[G2962]] he stands [[G4739]] or [[G2228]] falls. [[G4098]] And [[G1161]] he will stand, [[G2476]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is able [[G1414]] to make him stand. [[G2476]] 
5 One [man] [[G3739]] regards [[G2919]] [a certain] day [[G2250]] above [[G3844]] [the others], [[G2250]] while [[G1161]] someone [else] [[G3739]] considers [[G2919]] every [[G3956]] day [alike]. [[G2250]] Each [one] [[G1538]] should be fully convinced [[G4135]] in [[G1722]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] mind. [[G3563]] 
6 He who [[G3588]] observes [[G5426]] [a special] day [[G2250]] [does so] [[G5426]] to [the] Lord; [[G2962]] he who [[G3588]] eats [[G2068]] [does so] [[G2068]] to [the] Lord, [[G2962]] for [[G1063]] he gives thanks [[G2168]] to God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] he who [[G3588]] abstains [[G2068]] [does so] [[G2068]] to [the] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] gives thanks [[G2168]] to God. [[G2316]] 
7 For [[G1063]] none [[G3762]] of us [[G1473]] lives [[G2198]] to himself [alone], [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] none [ of us ] [[G3762]] dies [[G599]] to himself [alone]. [[G1438]] 
8 If [[G1437]] we live, [[G2198]] we live [[G2198]] to the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G5037]] if [[G1437]] we die, [[G599]] we die [[G599]] to the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] So [[G3767]] whether [[G1437]] we live [[G2198]] [or] [[G5037]] die, [[G599]] we belong to [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
9 For [[G1519]] this reason [[G3778]] Christ [[G5547]] died [[G599]] and [[G2532]] returned to life, [[G2198]] so that [[G2443]] He might be the Lord of [[G2961]] both [[G2532]] [the] dead [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] [the] living. [[G2198]] 
10 Why, [[G5101]] then, [[G1161]] {do} you [[G4771]] judge [[G2919]] your [[G4771]] brother? [[G80]] Or [[G2228]] why [[G5101]] {do} you [[G4771]] belittle [[G1848]] your [[G4771]] brother? [[G80]] For [[G1063]] we will all stand before [[G3936]] God’s [[G2316]] judgment seat. [[G968]] 
11 It is written: [[G1125]] “[As surely as] I [[G1473]] live, [[G2198]] says [[G3004]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] every [[G3956]] knee [[G1119]] will bow [[G2578]] before Me; [[G1473]] every [[G3956]] tongue [[G1100]] will confess [[G1843]] to God.” [[G2316]] 
12 So [[G686]] then, [[G3767]] each [[G1538]] of us [[G1473]] will give [[G1325]] an account [[G3056]] of [[G4012]] himself [[G1438]] to God. [[G2316]] 
13 Therefore [[G3767]] let us stop judging [[G2919]] one another. [[G240]] Instead, [[G235]] make up your mind [[G2919]] not [[G3361]] to put [[G5087]] [any] stumbling block [[G4348]] or [[G2228]] obstacle [[G4625]] in your brother’s way. [[G80]] 
14 I am convinced [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] fully persuaded [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] that [[G3754]] nothing [is] [[G3762]] unclean [[G2839]] in [[G1223]] itself. [[G1438]] But if [[G1487]] [anyone] [[G3588]] regards [[G3049]] something [[G5100]] as [[G1510]] unclean, [[G2839]] [then] for him [[G1565]] [it is] unclean. [[G2839]] 
15 If [[G1487]] your [[G4771]] brother [[G80]] is distressed [[G3076]] by [[G1223]] [what you eat], [[G1033]] you are no longer acting [[G4043]] in [[G2596]] love. [[G26]] {Do} not [[G3361]] by [[G3588]] [your eating] [[G1033]] destroy [[G622]] your [[G4771]] [brother], [[G1565]] for [[G5228]] whom [[G3739]] Christ [[G5547]] died. [[G599]] 
16 {Do} not {allow} [[G3361]] what [[G3588]] you [consider] [[G4771]] good, [[G18]] then, [[G3767]] to be spoken of as evil. [[G987]] 
17 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] not [a matter of] [[G3756]] eating [[G1035]] and [[G2532]] drinking, [[G4213]] but [[G235]] of righteousness, [[G1343]] peace, [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] joy [[G5479]] in [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
18 For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3588]] serves [[G1398]] Christ [[G5547]] in [[G1722]] this way [[G3778]] [is] pleasing [[G2101]] to God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] approved [[G1384]] by men. [[G444]] 
19 So [[G686]] then, [[G3767]] let us pursue [[G1377]] what leads to [[G3588]] peace [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] to [[G3588]] mutual [[G240]] edification. [[G3619]] 
20 {Do} not [[G3361]] destroy [[G2647]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] of God [[G2316]] for the sake of [[G1752]] food. [[G1033]] All [food is] [[G3956]] clean, [[G2513]] but [[G235]] [it is] wrong [[G2556]] for a man [[G444]] to let his eating be [[G2068]] a stumbling block. [[G4348]] 
21 [It is] better [[G2570]] not [[G3361]] to eat [[G5315]] meat [[G2907]] [or] [[G3366]] drink [[G4095]] wine [[G3631]] [or to do anything] [[G3366]] [to cause] [[G3739]] your [[G4771]] brother [[G80]] to stumble. [[G4350]] 
22 Keep [[G2192]] your [[G4771]] belief [[G4102]] [about such matters] [[G3739]] between [[G2596]] yourself [[G4572]] [and] [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]] Blessed [is] [[G3107]] the [one who] [[G3588]] does not condemn [[G2919]] himself [[G1438]] by [[G1722]] what [[G3739]] he approves. [[G1381]] 
23 But [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] has doubts [[G1252]] is condemned [[G2632]] if [[G1437]] he eats, [[G5315]] because [his eating is] [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] from [[G1537]] faith; [[G4102]] and [[G1161]] everything [[G3956]] that [is] [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] from [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] is [[G1510]] sin.
