[[Romans 9|←]] • [[Romans 11|→]]
1 Brothers, [[G80]] my [[G1699]] heart’s [[G2588]] desire [[G2107]] and [[G2532]] prayer [[G1162]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] [the Israelites] [[G846]] [is] for [[G1519]] [their] salvation. [[G4991]] 
2 For [[G1063]] I testify [[G3140]] about them [[G846]] that [[G3754]] they are [[G2192]] zealous [[G2205]] for God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] on the basis of [[G2596]] knowledge. [[G1922]] 
3 Because [[G1063]] they were ignorant [[G50]] of God’s [[G2316]] righteousness [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] sought [[G2212]] to establish [[G2476]] [their] [[G3588]] own, [[G2398]] they did not submit [[G5293]] to [[G3588]] God’s [[G2316]] righteousness. [[G1343]] 
4 Christ [is] [[G5547]] [the] end [[G5056]] of the Law, [[G3551]] in order to bring [[G1519]] righteousness [[G1343]] to everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believes. [[G4100]] 
5 For [[G1063]] concerning the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1343]] that [[G3588]] is by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] Moses [[G3475]] writes: [[G1125]] “The [[G3588]] man [who] [[G444]] does [[G4160]] these things [[G846]] will live [[G2198]] by [[G1722]] them.” [[G846]] 
6 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1343]] that is by [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] says: [[G3004]] “Do not say [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] heart, [[G2588]] ‘Who [[G5101]] will ascend [[G305]] into [[G1519]] heaven?’ [[G3772]] (that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] to bring Christ down [[G2609]] ) [[G5547]] 
7 or, [[G2228]] ‘Who [[G5101]] will descend [[G2597]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Abyss?’ [[G12]] (that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] to bring [[G321]] Christ [[G5547]] up from [[G1537]] [the] dead).” [[G3498]] 
8 But [[G235]] what [[G5101]] does it say? [[G3004]] “The [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] is [[G1510]] near [[G1451]] you, [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] mouth [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] heart,” [[G2588]] that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] of faith [[G4102]] we are proclaiming: [[G2784]] 
9 that [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] you confess [[G3670]] with [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] mouth, [[G4750]] “Jesus [[G2424]] [is] Lord,” [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] heart [[G2588]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] raised [[G1453]] Him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] you will be saved. [[G4982]] 
10 For [[G1063]] with [your] heart [[G2588]] [you] believe [[G4100]] [and are] [[G1519]] justified, [[G1343]] and [[G1161]] with [your] mouth [[G4750]] [you] confess [[G3670]] [and are] [[G1519]] saved. [[G4991]] 
11 [It is] just as [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] says: [[G3004]] “Anyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] Him [[G846]] will never [[G3756]] be put to shame.” [[G2617]] 
12 For [[G1063]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] difference [[G1293]] between [[G5037]] Jew [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greek: [[G1672]] The [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Lord [[G2962]] [is Lord] of all, [[G3956]] [and] gives richly [[G4147]] to [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] call [[G1941]] on Him, [[G846]] 
13 for, [[G1063]] “Everyone who [[G3956]] calls on [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] will be saved.” [[G4982]] 
14 How [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] can they call [[G1941]] on [[G1519]] [the One] [[G3739]] in whom they have not believed? [[G4100]] And [[G1161]] how [[G4459]] can they believe in [the One] [[G4100]] of whom [[G3739]] they have not heard? [[G191]] And [[G1161]] how [[G4459]] can they hear [[G191]] without [[G5565]] [someone] to preach? [[G2784]] 
15 And [[G1161]] how [[G4459]] can they preach [[G2784]] unless [[G1437]] they are sent? [[G649]] As [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “How [[G5613]] beautiful [are] [[G5611]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] of those who [[G3588]] bring good news!” [[G2097]] 
16 But [[G235]] not [[G3756]] all of them [[G3956]] welcomed [[G5219]] the [[G3588]] good news. [[G2098]] For [[G1063]] Isaiah [[G2268]] says, [[G3004]] “Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G5101]] has believed [[G4100]] our [[G1473]] message?” [[G189]] 
17 Consequently, [[G686]] faith [comes] [[G4102]] by [[G1537]] hearing, [[G189]] and [[G1161]] hearing [[G189]] by [[G1223]] [the] word [[G4487]] of Christ. [[G5547]] 
18 But [[G235]] I ask, [[G3004]] did they not hear? [[G191]] Indeed [they did]: [[G3304]] “Their [[G846]] voice [[G5353]] has gone out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] their [[G846]] words [[G4487]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ends [[G4009]] of the [[G3588]] world.” [[G3625]] 
19 I ask [[G3004]] instead: [[G235]] {Did} Israel [[G2474]] not [[G3756]] understand? [[G1097]] First, [[G4413]] Moses [[G3475]] says: [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] will make you jealous [[G3863]] by [those who are] [[G1909]] not [[G3756]] a nation; [[G1484]] I will make you angry [[G3949]] by [[G1909]] a nation [[G1484]] without understanding.” [[G801]] 
20 And [[G1161]] Isaiah [[G2268]] boldly [[G662]] says: [[G3004]] “I was found [[G2147]] by [[G1722]] those who [[G3588]] did not seek [[G2212]] Me; [[G1473]] I revealed Myself [[G1717]] to those who [[G3588]] did not ask for [[G1905]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
21 But [[G1161]] as for [[G4314]] Israel [[G2474]] he says: [[G3004]] “All [[G3650]] day long [[G2250]] I have held out [[G1600]] My [[G1473]] hands [[G5495]] to [[G4314]] [a] disobedient [[G544]] and [[G2532]] obstinate [[G483]] people.” [[G2992]]
