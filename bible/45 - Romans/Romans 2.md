[[Romans 1|←]] • [[Romans 3|→]]
1 You [[G1510]] therefore [[G1352]] have no excuse, [[G379]] [you] [[G444]] who [[G3956]] pass judgment [on another]. [[G2919]] For [[G1063]] on [[G1722]] whatever grounds [[G3739]] you judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] other, [[G2087]] you are condemning [[G2632]] yourself, [[G4572]] because [[G1063]] [you who] [[G3588]] pass judgment [[G2919]] do [[G4238]] the [[G3588]] same things. [[G846]] 
2 And [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] God’s [[G2316]] judgment [[G2917]] against [[G1909]] those who [[G3588]] do [[G4238]] such things [[G5108]] is [[G1510]] based on [[G2596]] truth. [[G225]] 
3 [So when] [[G1161]] [you], [[G3588]] O [[G5599]] man, [[G444]] pass judgment on [[G2919]] [others], [[G3588]] yet [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] the same things, [[G5108]] do you think [[G3049]] you [[G4771]] will escape [[G1628]] God’s [[G2316]] judgment? [[G2917]] 
4 Or [[G2228]] do you disregard [[G2706]] the [[G3588]] riches [[G4149]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] kindness, [[G5544]] tolerance, [[G463]] and [[G2532]] patience, [[G3115]] not realizing [[G50]] that [[G3754]] God’s [[G2316]] kindness [[G5543]] leads [[G71]] you [[G4771]] to [[G1519]] repentance? [[G3341]] 
5 But [[G1161]] because of [[G2596]] your [[G4771]] hard [[G4643]] and [[G2532]] unrepentant [[G279]] heart, [[G2588]] you are storing up [[G2343]] wrath [[G3709]] against yourself [[G4572]] for [[G1722]] [the] day [[G2250]] of wrath, [[G3709]] [when] [[G2532]] God’s [[G2316]] righteous judgment [[G1341]] will be revealed. [[G602]] 
6 [God] [[G3739]] “will repay [[G591]] each one [[G1538]] according to [[G2596]] his [[G846]] deeds.” [[G2041]] 
7 To those who [[G3588]] by [[G2596]] perseverance [[G5281]] in doing [[G2041]] good [[G18]] seek [[G2212]] glory, [[G1391]] honor, [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] immortality, [[G861]] [He will give] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]] 
8 But [[G1161]] for those who [[G3588]] [are] self-seeking [[G2052]] and [[G2532]] who reject [[G544]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] and [[G1161]] follow [[G3982]] wickedness, [[G93]] [there will be] wrath [[G3709]] and [[G2532]] anger. [[G2372]] 
9 [There will be] trouble [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] distress [[G4730]] for [[G1909]] every [[G3956]] human [[G444]] being [[G5590]] who [[G3588]] does [[G2716]] evil, [[G2556]] first [[G4412]] for the Jew, [[G2453]] then [[G2532]] for the Greek; [[G1672]] 
10 but [[G1161]] glory, [[G1391]] honor, [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] for everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] does [[G2038]] good, [[G18]] first [[G2453]] for the Jew, [[G4412]] then [[G2532]] for the Greek. [[G1672]] 
11 For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] does not show [[G1510]] favoritism. [[G4382]] 
12 All who [[G3745]] sin [[G264]] apart from the Law [[G460]] will also perish [[G622]] apart from the Law, [[G460]] and [[G2532]] all who [[G3745]] sin [[G264]] under [[G1722]] [the] Law [[G3551]] will be judged [[G2919]] by [[G1223]] [the] Law. [[G3551]] 
13 For [it is] [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] hearers [[G202]] of [the] Law [[G3551]] [who are] righteous [[G1342]] before [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] but [it is] [[G235]] the [[G3588]] doers [[G4163]] of [the] Law [[G3551]] [who] will be declared righteous. [[G1344]] 
14 Indeed, [[G1063]] when [[G3752]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] who [[G3588]] do not have [[G2192]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] do [[G4160]] by nature [[G5449]] what [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] Law [requires], [[G3551]] they are [[G1510]] a law [[G3551]] to themselves, [[G1438]] [even though] they [[G3778]] do not have [[G2192]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] 
15 [since] they [[G3748]] show [that] [[G1731]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] of the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] is written [[G1123]] on [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] their [[G846]] consciences [[G4893]] also [[G2532]] bearing witness, [[G4828]] [and] their [[G240]] thoughts [[G3053]] either [[G3342]] accusing [[G2723]] or [[G2228]] defending [them]. [[G626]] 
16 [ This will come to pass ] on [[G1722]] that [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] when [[G3753]] God [[G2316]] will judge [[G2919]] men’s [[G444]] secrets [[G2927]] through [[G1223]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] as proclaimed by [[G2596]] my [[G1473]] gospel. [[G2098]] 
17 Now [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] if [[G1487]] you call [yourself] [[G2028]] a Jew; [[G2453]] [if you] [[G2532]] rely on [[G1879]] [the] Law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] boast [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] God; [[G2316]] 
18 [if you] [[G2532]] know [[G1097]] [His] [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] and [[G2532]] approve [[G1381]] of what [[G3588]] is superior [[G1308]] because you are instructed [[G2727]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Law; [[G3551]] 
19 [if you] [[G5037]] are convinced [that] [[G3982]] you [[G4572]] are [[G1510]] a guide [[G3595]] for [the] blind, [[G5185]] a light [[G5457]] for those [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] darkness, [[G4655]] 
20 an instructor [[G3810]] of [the] foolish, [[G878]] a teacher [[G1320]] of infants, [[G3516]] [because] you have [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] the [[G3588]] embodiment [[G3446]] of knowledge [[G1108]] and [[G2532]] truth— [[G225]] 
21 {you,} then, [[G3767]] who [[G3588]] teach [[G1321]] others, [[G2087]] do you not teach [[G1321]] yourself? [[G4572]] You who [[G3588]] preach [[G2784]] against [[G3361]] stealing, [[G2813]] do you steal? [[G2813]] 
22 You who [[G3588]] forbid [[G3004]] adultery, [[G3431]] do you commit adultery? [[G3431]] You who [[G3588]] abhor [[G948]] idols, [[G1497]] do you rob temples? [[G2416]] 
23 You who [[G3739]] boast [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] do you dishonor [[G818]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] breaking [[G3847]] the [[G3588]] Law? [[G3551]] 
24 As [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “God’s [[G2316]] name [[G3686]] is blasphemed [[G987]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] because of [[G1223]] you.” [[G4771]] 
25 Circumcision [[G4061]] has value [[G5623]] if [[G1437]] you observe [[G4238]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] you [[G1510]] break [[G3848]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] your [[G4771]] circumcision [[G4061]] has become [[G1096]] uncircumcision. [[G203]] 
26 If [[G1437]] a man who is not circumcised [[G203]] keeps [[G5442]] the [[G3588]] requirements [[G1345]] of the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] {will} not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] uncircumcision [[G203]] be regarded [[G3049]] as [[G1519]] circumcision? [[G4061]] 
27 The [one who is] [[G3588]] physically [[G5449]] uncircumcised [[G203]] [yet] keeps [[G5055]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] will condemn [[G2919]] you [[G4771]] who, [[G3588]] [even though you have] [[G1223]] [the] written code [[G1121]] and [[G2532]] circumcision, [[G4061]] [are] a lawbreaker. [[G3848]] 
28 A [man] [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] a Jew [[G2453]] [ because he is one ] [[G1722]] outwardly, [[G5318]] nor [[G3761]] [is] circumcision [[G4061]] [ only ] outward [[G5318]] [and] [[G1722]] physical. [[G4561]] 
29 No, [[G235]] a man [is] [[G3588]] a Jew [[G2453]] [ because he is one ] [[G1722]] inwardly, [[G2927]] and [[G2532]] circumcision [is a matter] [[G4061]] of the heart, [[G2588]] by [[G1722]] [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] not [[G3756]] by the written code. [[G1121]] [Such a man’s] [[G3739]] praise [[G1868]] [does] not [come] [[G3756]] from [[G1537]] men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] from [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]]
