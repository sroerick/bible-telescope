1 What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] shall we say [[G2046]] [that] Abraham, [[G11]] our [[G1473]] forefather, [[G3962]] has discovered? [[G2147]] 
2 If [[G1487]] Abraham [[G11]] was indeed justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] works, [[G2041]] he had [[G2192]] something to boast about, [[G2745]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] before [[G4314]] God. [[G2316]] 
3 For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] {does} the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] say? [[G3004]] “Abraham [[G11]] believed [[G4100]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] it was credited [[G3049]] to him [[G846]] as [[G1519]] righteousness.” [[G1343]] 
4 Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] wages [[G3408]] of [[G3588]] [the] worker [[G2038]] are not credited [[G3049]] as [[G2596]] a gift, [[G5485]] but [[G235]] as [[G2596]] an obligation. [[G3783]] 
5 However, [[G1161]] to the [one who] [[G3588]] does not work, [[G2038]] but [[G1161]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] Him who [[G3588]] justifies [[G1344]] the [[G3588]] wicked, [[G765]] his [[G846]] faith [[G4102]] is credited [[G3049]] as [[G1519]] righteousness. [[G1343]] 
6 And [[G2532]] David [[G1138]] speaks [[G3004]] likewise [[G2509]] of the [[G3588]] blessedness [[G3108]] of the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] to whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] credits [[G3049]] righteousness [[G1343]] apart from [[G5565]] works: [[G2041]] 
7 “Blessed [[G3107]] [are they] whose [[G3739]] iniquities [[G458]] are forgiven, [[G863]] whose [[G3739]] sins [[G266]] are covered. [[G1943]] 
8 Blessed [is] [[G3107]] [the] man [[G435]] [whose] sin [[G266]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] will never count [[G3049]] against him.” [[G3739]] 
9 [Is] this [[G3778]] blessing [[G3108]] [only] [[G3767]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] circumcised, [[G4061]] or [[G2228]] also [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] uncircumcised? [[G203]] We have been saying [[G3004]] that [[G3588]] Abraham’s [[G11]] faith [[G4102]] was credited [[G3049]] as [[G1519]] righteousness. [[G1343]] 
10 In what context [[G4459]] was it credited? [[G3049]] [Was it after] [[G1510]] his circumcision, [[G4061]] or [[G2228]] [before]? [[G203]] [It was] not [[G3756]] [after], [[G4061]] but [[G235]] [before]. [[G203]] 
11 And [[G2532]] he received [[G2983]] [the] sign [[G4592]] of circumcision [[G4061]] [as] a seal [[G4973]] of the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1343]] that [he had] [[G3588]] by [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] [while] [[G1722]] [he was still] uncircumcised. [[G203]] So then, [[G1519]] he [[G846]] is [[G1510]] [the] father [[G3962]] of all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believe [[G4100]] [but] [[G2532]] are not circumcised, [[G203]] in order that [[G1519]] righteousness [[G1343]] might be credited [[G3049]] to them. [[G846]] 
12 And [[G2532]] [he is also the] father [[G3962]] of the circumcised [[G4061]] who [[G3588]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] are circumcised, [[G4061]] but [[G235]] who [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] walk [[G4748]] in the [[G3588]] footsteps [[G2487]] of the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] [that] [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] Abraham [[G11]] had before he was circumcised. [[G203]] 
13 For [[G1063]] it was not [[G3756]] through [[G1223]] [the] Law [[G3551]] [that] Abraham [[G11]] [and] [[G2228]] his [[G846]] descendants [[G4690]] were promised [[G1860]] that [[G3588]] he [[G846]] would be [[G1510]] heir [[G2818]] [of the] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] through [[G1223]] [the] righteousness [[G1343]] that comes by faith. [[G4102]] 
14 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] those [[G3588]] [who live by] [[G1537]] [the] Law [[G3551]] [are] heirs, [[G2818]] faith [[G4102]] is useless [[G2758]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] is worthless, [[G2673]] 
15 because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] brings [[G2716]] wrath. [[G3709]] And [[G1161]] where [[G3757]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] law, [[G3551]] [there is] no [[G3761]] transgression. [[G3847]] 
16 Therefore, [[G1223]] [the promise comes] [[G3778]] by [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] so that [[G2443]] [it] [[G1860]] may rest on [[G2596]] grace [[G5485]] [and] may be [[G1510]] guaranteed [[G949]] to all [[G3956]] [Abraham’s] [[G3588]] offspring— [[G4690]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] to those who are [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] to those who are [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] [the] faith [[G4102]] of Abraham. [[G11]] [He] [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] father [[G3962]] of us [[G1473]] all. [[G3956]] 
17 As [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “I have made [[G5087]] you [[G4771]] a father [[G3962]] of many [[G4183]] nations.” [[G1484]] [He is our father] in the presence of [[G2713]] God, [[G2316]] in whom [[G3739]] he believed, [[G4100]] the [God who] [[G3588]] gives life [[G2227]] to the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] calls [[G2564]] [into] being [[G1510]] what [[G3588]] {does} not [[G3361]] yet [[G5613]] exist. [[G1510]] 
18 Against [[G3844]] all hope, [[G1680]] [Abraham] [[G3739]] in [[G1909]] hope [[G1680]] believed [[G4100]] and so [[G1519]] became [[G1096]] [the] father [[G3962]] of many [[G4183]] nations, [[G1484]] just as [[G2596]] he had been told, [[G2046]] “So [[G3779]] {shall} your [[G4771]] offspring [[G4690]] be.” [[G1510]] 
19 Without [[G3361]] weakening [[G770]] in [his] [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] he acknowledged [[G2657]] the [[G3588]] decrepitness [[G3499]] of his [[G1438]] body [[G4983]] (since he was [[G5225]] about [[G4225]] a hundred years old) [[G1541]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] lifelessness [[G3500]] of Sarah’s [[G4564]] womb. [[G3388]] 
20 Yet [[G1161]] he did not waver [[G1252]] through disbelief [[G570]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] of God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] was strengthened [[G1743]] in his [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] [and] gave [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] to God, [[G2316]] 
21 being fully persuaded that [[G4135]] [God] was [[G1510]] able [[G1415]] to do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] He had promised. [[G1861]] 
22 That is why [[G1352]] “it was credited [[G3049]] to him [[G846]] as [[G1519]] righteousness.” [[G1343]] 
23 Now [[G1161]] [the words] [[G3754]] “it was credited [[G3049]] to him” [[G846]] were written [[G1125]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] for [[G1223]] [Abraham], [[G846]] 
24 but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] us, [[G1473]] to whom [[G3739]] [righteousness] will be credited— [[G3049]] for us who [[G3588]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] Him who [[G3588]] raised [[G1453]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]] 
25 [He] [[G3739]] was delivered over to death [[G3860]] for [[G1223]] our [[G1473]] trespasses [[G3900]] and [[G2532]] was raised to life [[G1453]] for [[G1223]] our [[G1473]] justification. [[G1347]]
