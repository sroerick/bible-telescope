# 1 Peter 5
[[1 Peter 4|←]] • [[2 Peter 1|→]]
1 [As] [[G3588]] a fellow elder, [[G4850]] a witness [[G3144]] of [[G3588]] Christ’s [[G5547]] sufferings, [[G3804]] and [[G2532]] a partaker [[G2844]] of the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] to be revealed, [[G601]] I appeal to [[G3870]] [the] elders [[G4245]] among [[G1722]] you: [[G4771]] 
2 Be shepherds [[G4165]] of God’s [[G2316]] flock [[G4168]] [that is] among [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] watching over them [[G1983]] not [[G3361]] out of compulsion, [[G317]] but [[G235]] because it is [[G2596]] God’s [[G2316]] will; [[G1596]] not [[G3366]] out of greed, [[G147]] but [[G235]] out of eagerness; [[G4290]] 
3 not [[G3366]] lording it over [[G2634]] those entrusted to you, [[G2819]] but [[G235]] being [[G1096]] examples [[G5179]] to the [[G3588]] flock. [[G4168]] 
4 And [when] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Chief Shepherd [[G750]] appears, [[G5319]] you will receive [[G2865]] the [[G3588]] crown [[G4735]] of glory [[G1391]] that will never fade away. [[G262]] 
5 Young men, [[G3501]] in the same way, [[G3668]] submit yourselves [[G5293]] to [your] elders. [[G4245]] And [[G1161]] all [of you], [[G3956]] clothe yourselves [[G1463]] with humility [[G5012]] toward one another, [[G240]] because, [[G3754]] “God [[G2316]] opposes [[G498]] [the] proud, [[G5244]] but [[G1161]] gives [[G1325]] grace [[G5485]] to [the] humble.” [[G5011]] 
6 Humble yourselves, [[G5013]] therefore, [[G3767]] under [[G5259]] God’s [[G2316]] mighty [[G2900]] hand, [[G5495]] so that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] [due] time [[G2540]] He may exalt [[G5312]] you. [[G4771]] 
7 Cast [[G1977]] all [[G3956]] your [[G4771]] anxiety [[G3308]] on [[G1909]] Him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] He [[G846]] cares [[G3199]] for [[G4012]] you. [[G4771]] 
8 Be sober-minded [[G3525]] [and] alert. [[G1127]] Your [[G4771]] adversary [[G476]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] prowls around [[G4043]] like [[G5613]] a roaring [[G5612]] lion, [[G3023]] seeking [[G2212]] [someone] [[G5101]] to devour. [[G2666]] 
9 Resist [[G436]] [him], [[G3739]] [standing] firm [[G4731]] in [your] [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] [and] in the knowledge that [[G1492]] your [[G4771]] brothers [[G81]] throughout [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] are undergoing [[G2005]] the [[G3588]] same kinds [[G846]] of [[G3588]] suffering. [[G3804]] 
10 And [[G1161]] [after you] have suffered [[G3958]] for a little while, [[G3641]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of all [[G3956]] grace, [[G5485]] who [[G3588]] has called [[G2564]] you [[G4771]] to [[G1519]] His [[G846]] eternal [[G166]] glory [[G1391]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] will Himself [[G846]] restore [you], [[G2675]] secure [you], [[G4741]] strengthen [you], [[G4599]] [and] establish [you]. [[G2311]] 
11 To Him [be] [[G846]] the [[G3588]] power [[G2904]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]] 
12 Through [[G1223]] Silvanus, [[G4610]] [whom] I regard [[G3049]] as [[G5613]] a [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] brother, [[G80]] I have written [[G1125]] to you [[G4771]] briefly, [[G3641]] encouraging [you] [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] testifying [[G1957]] [that] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] [the] true [[G227]] grace [[G5485]] of God. [[G2316]] Stand firm [[G2476]] in [[G1519]] [it]. [[G3739]] 
13 [The church] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Babylon, [[G897]] chosen together with [you], [[G4899]] sends you greetings, [[G782]] [as does] [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] son [[G5207]] Mark. [[G3138]] 
14 Greet [[G782]] one another [[G240]] with [[G1722]] a kiss [[G5370]] of love. [[G26]] Peace [[G1515]] to all [[G3956]] of you [[G4771]] who [are] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]]
