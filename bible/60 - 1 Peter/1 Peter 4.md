1 Therefore, since [[G3767]] Christ [[G5547]] suffered [[G3958]] in [His] body, [[G4561]] arm yourselves with [[G3695]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] resolve, [[G1771]] because [[G3754]] anyone who [[G3588]] has suffered [[G3958]] [in his] body [[G4561]] is done with [[G3973]] sin. [[G266]] 
2 Consequently, [[G1519]] he does not live out [[G980]] [his] [[G3588]] remaining [[G1954]] time [[G5550]] on earth [[G4561]] for human [[G444]] passions, [[G1939]] but [[G235]] for [the] will [[G2307]] of God. [[G2316]] 
3 For [[G1063]] [you have spent] enough [[G713]] time [[G5550]] in the past [[G3928]] carrying out [[G2716]] the same [[G3588]] desires [[G1013]] as the [[G3588]] pagans: [[G1484]] living [[G4198]] in [[G1722]] debauchery, [[G766]] lust, [[G1939]] drunkenness, [[G3632]] orgies, [[G2970]] carousing, [[G4224]] and [[G2532]] detestable [[G111]] idolatry. [[G1495]] 
4 Because of [[G1722]] this, [[G3739]] they consider it strange [[G3579]] of you [[G4771]] not [[G3361]] to plunge with [them] [[G4936]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] flood [[G401]] of reckless indiscretion, [[G810]] [and] they heap abuse on you. [[G987]] 
5 [But they] [[G3739]] will have to give [[G591]] an account [[G3056]] to Him who [[G3588]] is [[G2192]] ready [[G2093]] to judge [[G2919]] [the] living [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] [the] dead. [[G3498]] 
6 That is why [[G3778]] the gospel was preached [[G2097]] even [[G2532]] to [those who are now] dead, [[G3498]] so that [[G2443]] they might be judged [[G2919]] as [[G2596]] men [[G444]] in [the] flesh, [[G4561]] but [[G1161]] live [[G2198]] according to [[G2596]] God [[G2316]] in [the] spirit. [[G4151]] 
7 The [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] of all [things] [[G3956]] is near. [[G1448]] Therefore [[G3767]] be clear-minded [[G4993]] and [[G2532]] sober, [[G3525]] so [[G1519]] you can pray. [[G4335]] 
8 Above [[G4253]] all, [[G3956]] love [[G26]] one another [[G1438]] deeply, [[G1618]] because [[G3754]] love [[G26]] covers over [[G2572]] a multitude [[G4128]] of sins. [[G266]] 
9 Show hospitality [[G5382]] to [[G1519]] one another [[G240]] without [[G427]] complaining. [[G1112]] 
10 As [[G5613]] good [[G2570]] stewards [[G3623]] of [the] manifold [[G4164]] grace [[G5485]] of God, [[G2316]] each [of you] [[G1538]] [should use] [[G1519]] whatever [[G846]] gift [[G5486]] he has received [[G2983]] to serve [[G1247]] one another. [[G1438]] 
11 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] speaks, [[G2980]] [he should speak] as [[G5613]] one conveying the words of God. [[G3051]] If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] serves, [[G1247]] [he should serve] [[G5613]] with [[G1537]] [the] strength [[G2479]] God [[G2316]] supplies, [[G5524]] so that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] all things [[G3956]] God [[G2316]] may be glorified [[G1392]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] to whom [[G3739]] be [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] power [[G2904]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]] 
12 Beloved, [[G27]] {do} not [[G3361]] be surprised at [[G3579]] the [[G3588]] fiery [[G4451]] trial [[G3986]] that has come [[G1096]] upon [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] as though [[G5613]] something strange [[G3581]] were happening [[G4819]] to you. [[G4771]] 
13 But [[G235]] rejoice [[G5463]] that [[G2526]] you share [[G2841]] in the [[G3588]] sufferings [[G3804]] of Christ, [[G5547]] so that [[G2443]] you may be overjoyed [[G5463]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] revelation [[G602]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] glory. [[G1391]] 
14 If [[G1487]] you are insulted [[G3679]] for [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of Christ, [[G5547]] [you are] blessed, [[G3107]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] of God [[G2316]] rests [[G373]] on [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]] 
15 Indeed, [[G1063]] [none] [[G5100]] of you [[G4771]] should suffer [[G3958]] as [[G5613]] a murderer [[G5406]] or [[G2228]] thief [[G2812]] or [[G2228]] wrongdoer, [[G2555]] or [[G2228]] even as [[G5613]] a meddler. [[G244]] 
16 But [[G1161]] if [you suffer] [[G1487]] as [[G5613]] a Christian, [[G5546]] do not be ashamed, [[G153]] but [[G1161]] glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] [that you bear] [[G1722]] that [[G3778]] name. [[G3686]] 
17 For [it is] [[G3754]] time [for] [[G2540]] judgment [[G2917]] to begin [[G756]] with [[G575]] the [[G3588]] family [[G3624]] of God; [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] it begins [[G4412]] with [[G575]] us, [[G1473]] what [will] [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] outcome [be] [[G5056]] for those who [[G3588]] disobey [[G544]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of God? [[G2316]] 
18 And, [[G2532]] “If [[G1487]] it is hard for [[G3433]] the [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] to be saved, [[G4982]] what [[G4226]] will become of [[G5316]] the [[G3588]] ungodly [[G765]] and [[G2532]] [the] sinner?” [[G268]] 
19 So then, [[G5620]] those who [[G3588]] suffer [[G3958]] according to [[G2596]] God’s [[G2316]] will [[G2307]] should entrust [[G3908]] their [[G846]] souls [[G5590]] to [their] faithful [[G4103]] Creator [[G2939]] and continue [[G1722]] to do good. [[G16]]
