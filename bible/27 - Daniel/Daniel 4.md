1 King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] To the peoples, [[H5972]] nations, [[H524]] and [men of] every [[H3606]] language [[H3961]] who [[H1768]] dwell [[H1753]] in all [[H3606]] the earth: [[H772]] May your prosperity [[H8001]] be multiplied. [[H7680]] 
2 I am pleased [[H8232]] to declare [[H2324]] the signs [[H852]] and wonders [[H8540]] that [[H1768]] the Most High [[H5943]] God [[H426]] has performed [[H5648]] for me: [[H5974]] 
3 How [[H4101]] great [[H7260]] [are] His signs, [[H852]] and how [[H4101]] mighty [[H8624]] His wonders! [[H8540]] His kingdom [[H4437]] is an eternal [[H5957]] kingdom, [[H4437]] and His dominion endures [[H7985]] from [[H5974]] generation [[H1859]] to generation. [[H1859]] 
4 I, [[H576]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] was [[H1934]] at ease [[H7954]] in my house [[H1005]] and flourishing [[H7487]] in my palace. [[H1965]] 
5 I had [[H2370]] a dream, [[H2493]] and it frightened me; [[H1763]] while in [[H5922]] my bed, [[H4903]] the images [[H2031]] and visions [[H2376]] in my mind [[H7217]] alarmed me. [[H927]] 
6 So [[H4481]] I issued [[H7761]] a decree [[H2942]] that all [[H3606]] the wise men [[H2445]] of Babylon [[H895]] be brought [[H5954]] before me [[H6925]] to [[H1768]] interpret [[H6591]] the dream [[H2493]] for me. [[H3046]] 
7 When [[H116]] the magicians, [[H2749]] enchanters, [[H826]] astrologers, [[H3779]] and diviners [[H1505]] came in, [[H5954]] I [[H576]] told [[H560]] them the dream, [[H2493]] and they could not [[H3809]] interpret it [[H6591]] for me.  
8 But at [[H5705]] last, [[H318]] Daniel [[H1841]] came into [[H5954]] my presence [[H6925]] ([his] [[H1768]] name is [[H8036]] Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] after the name [[H8036]] of my god, [[H426]] and the spirit [[H7308]] of the holy [[H6922]] gods [[H426]] is in him.) [[H1768]] And I told [[H560]] him the dream: [[H2493]] 
9 “O Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] chief [[H7229]] of the magicians, [[H2749]] because [[H1768]] I [[H576]] know [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] you have a spirit [[H7308]] of the holy [[H6922]] gods [[H426]] and that no [[H3809]] mystery [[H7328]] baffles [[H598]] you,  explain to me [[H560]] the visions [[H2376]] that [[H1768]] I saw [[H2370]] in my dream, [[H2493]] and the interpretation. [[H6591]] 
10 In these visions [[H2376]] of my mind [[H7217]] as I was lying [[H5922]] in bed, [[H4903]] I saw this [[H2370]] come to pass: [[H1934]] There was [[H431]] a tree [[H363]] in the middle [[H1459]] of the land, [[H772]] and its height [[H7314]] was great. [[H7690]] 
11 The tree [[H363]] grew large [[H7236]] and strong; [[H8631]] its top [[H7314]] reached [[H4291]] the sky, [[H8065]] and it was visible [[H2379]] to the ends [[H5491]] of the earth. [[H772]] 
12 Its leaves [[H6074]] were beautiful, [[H8209]] its fruit [[H4]] was abundant, [[H7690]] and upon it  was food [[H4203]] for all. [[H3606]] Under it [[H8460]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field [[H1251]] found shelter, [[H2927]] in its branches [[H6056]] the birds [[H6853]] of the air [[H8065]] nested, [[H1753]] and from it [[H4481]] every [[H3606]] creature [[H1321]] was fed. [[H2110]] 
13 As I lay [[H5922]] on my bed, [[H4903]] I also saw [[H2370]] in the visions [[H2376]] of my mind [[H7217]] a watcher, [[H5894]] a holy one, [[H6922]] coming down [[H5182]] from [[H4481]] heaven. [[H8065]] 
14 He called out [[H7123]] in a loud voice: [[H2429]] ‘Cut down [[H1414]] the tree [[H363]] and chop off [[H7113]] its branches; [[H6056]] strip off [[H5426]] its leaves [[H6074]] and scatter [[H921]] its fruit. [[H4]] Let the beasts [[H2423]] flee [[H5111]] from [[H4481]] under it, [[H8479]] and the birds [[H6853]] from [[H4481]] its branches. [[H6056]] 
15 But [[H1297]] leave [[H7662]] the stump [[H6136]] with its roots [[H8330]] in the ground, [[H772]] and a band [[H613]] of [[H1768]] iron [[H6523]] and bronze around it, [[H5174]] in the tender grass [[H1883]] of [[H1768]] the field. [[H1251]] Let him be drenched [[H6647]] with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven [[H8065]] and graze [[H2508]] with [[H5974]] the beasts [[H2423]] on the grass [[H6211]] of the earth. [[H772]] 
16 Let his mind [[H3825]] be changed [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] that of a man, [[H606]] and let him be given [[H3052]] the mind [[H3825]] of a beast [[H2423]] till seven [[H7655]] times [[H5732]] pass [[H2499]] him by. [[H5922]] 
17 This decision [[H6600]] is the decree [[H1510]] of the watchers, [[H5894]] the verdict [[H7595]] declared [[H3983]] by the holy ones, [[H6922]] so that [[H5705]] the living [[H2417]] will know [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the Most High [[H5943]] is ruler [[H7990]] over the kingdom [[H4437]] of mankind, [[H606]] and gives it [[H5415]] to whom [[H4479]] He wishes, [[H6634]] setting [[H6966]] over it [[H5921]] the lowliest [[H8215]] of men. [[H606]] 
18 This [[H1836]] is the dream [[H2493]] that I, [[H576]] King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] had. [[H2370]] Now, Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] tell [[H560]] me the interpretation, [[H6591]] because [[H6903]] none [[H3606]] of the wise men [[H2445]] of my kingdom [[H4437]] can [[H3202]] interpret it [[H6591]] for me. [[H3046]] But you [[H607]] [are] able, [[H3546]] because [[H1768]] the spirit [[H7308]] of the holy [[H6922]] gods [[H426]] [is] in you.  
19 For [[H116]] a [[H2298]] time, [[H8160]] Daniel, [[H1841]] who [[H1768]] was also known as [[H8036]] Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] was perplexed, [[H8075]] and his thoughts [[H7476]] alarmed him. [[H927]] So the king [[H4430]] said, [[H6032]] “Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] do not [[H409]] let the dream [[H2493]] or its interpretation [[H6591]] alarm you.” [[H927]] “My lord,” [[H4756]] replied [[H6032]] Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] “may the dream [[H2493]] apply to those who hate you, [[H8131]] and its interpretation [[H6591]] to your enemies! [[H6146]] 
20 The tree [[H363]] you saw, [[H2370]] which [[H1768]] grew large [[H7236]] and strong, [[H8631]] whose top [[H7314]] reached [[H4291]] the sky [[H8065]] and was visible [[H2379]] to all [[H3606]] the earth, [[H772]] 
21 whose foliage [[H6074]] was beautiful [[H8209]] and its fruit [[H4]] abundant, [[H7690]] providing food [[H4203]] for all, [[H3606]] under which [[H8460]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field [[H1251]] lived, [[H1753]] and in whose branches [[H6056]] the birds [[H6853]] of the air [[H8065]] nested— [[H7932]] 
22 you, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] are [that tree]! [[H607]] For you have become great [[H7236]] and strong; [[H8631]] your greatness [[H7238]] has grown [[H7236]] to reach [[H4291]] the sky, [[H8065]] and your dominion [[H7985]] extends to the ends [[H5491]] of the earth. [[H772]] 
23 And [[H1768]] you, O king, [[H4430]] saw [[H2370]] a watcher, [[H5894]] a holy one, [[H6922]] coming down [[H5182]] from [[H4481]] heaven [[H8065]] and saying: [[H560]] ‘Cut down [[H1414]] the tree [[H363]] and destroy it, [[H2255]] but [[H1297]] leave [[H7662]] the stump [[H6136]] with its roots [[H8330]] in the ground, [[H772]] with a band [[H613]] of iron [[H6523]] and bronze [around it], [[H5174]] in the tender grass [[H1883]] of [[H1768]] the field. [[H1251]] Let him be drenched [[H6647]] with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven, [[H8065]] and graze [[H2508]] with [[H5974]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field [[H1251]] till [[H1768]] seven [[H7655]] times [[H5732]] pass [[H2499]] him by. [[H5922]] 
24 This [[H1836]] is the interpretation, [[H6591]] O king, [[H4430]] and this is the decree [[H1510]] that the Most High [[H5943]] has issued [[H4291]] against [[H5922]] my lord [[H4756]] the king: [[H4430]] 
25 You will be driven away [[H2957]] from [[H4481]] mankind, [[H606]] and your dwelling [[H4070]] will be [[H1934]] with [[H5974]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field. [[H1251]] You will feed on [[H2939]] grass [[H6211]] like cattle [[H8450]] and be drenched [[H6647]] with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven, [[H8065]] and seven [[H7655]] times [[H5732]] shall pass [[H2499]] you by, [[H5921]] until [[H5705]] you acknowledge [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the Most High [[H5943]] is ruler [[H7990]] over the kingdom [[H4437]] of mankind, [[H606]] and He gives [[H5415]] it to anyone [[H4479]] He wishes. [[H6634]] 
26 As for the command [[H560]] to leave [[H7662]] the stump [[H6136]] of the tree [[H363]] with its roots, [[H8330]] your kingdom [[H4437]] will be restored [[H7011]] to you [[H4481]] as soon as [[H1768]] you acknowledge [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] Heaven [[H8065]] rules. [[H7990]] 
27 Therefore, [[H3861]] may my advice [[H4431]] be pleasing [[H8232]] to you, [[H5921]] O king. [[H4430]] Break away [[H6562]] from your sins [[H2408]] by doing what is right, [[H6665]] and from your iniquities [[H5758]] by showing mercy [[H2604]] to the oppressed. [[H6033]] Perhaps [[H2006]] there will be [[H1934]] an extension [[H754]] of your prosperity.” [[H7963]] 
28 All [[H3606]] this happened [[H4291]] to [[H5922]] King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar. [[H5020]] 
29 Twelve [[H8648]] months [[H3393]] later, [[H7118]] as he was [[H1934]] walking [[H1981]] on [[H5922]] the roof of the royal palace [[H1965]] of [[H1768]] Babylon, [[H895]] 
30 the king [[H4430]] exclaimed, [[H6032]] “Is this [[H1668]] not [[H3809]] Babylon [[H895]] the Great, [[H7229]] which [[H1768]] I myself [[H576]] have built [[H1124]] by the might [[H8632]] of my power [[H2632]] as a royal [[H4437]] residence [[H1005]] and for the glory [[H3367]] of my majesty?” [[H1923]] 
31 While the words [[H4406]] were still [[H5751]] in the king’s [[H4430]] mouth, [[H6433]] a voice [[H7032]] came [[H5308]] from [[H4481]] heaven: [[H8065]] “It is decreed to you, [[H560]] King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] that the kingdom [[H4437]] has departed [[H5709]] from you. [[H4481]] 
32 You will be driven away [[H2957]] from [[H4481]] mankind [[H606]] to live [[H4070]] with [[H5974]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field, [[H1251]] and you will feed on [[H2939]] grass [[H6211]] like cattle. [[H8450]] And seven [[H7655]] times [[H5732]] will pass [[H2499]] you by, [[H5921]] until [[H5705]] you acknowledge [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the Most High [[H5943]] is ruler [[H7990]] over the kingdom [[H4437]] of men, [[H606]] and He gives [[H5415]] it to anyone [[H4479]] He wishes. [[H6634]] 
33 At that moment [[H8160]] the sentence [[H4406]] against [[H5922]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] was fulfilled. [[H5487]] He was driven away [[H2957]] from [[H4481]] mankind. [[H606]] He ate [[H399]] grass [[H6211]] like cattle, [[H8450]] and his body [[H1655]] was drenched [[H6647]] with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven, [[H8065]] until [[H5705]] his hair [[H8177]] grew [[H7236]] like [the feathers of] an eagle [[H5403]] and his nails [[H2953]] like [the claws of] a bird. [[H6853]] 
34 But at the end [[H7118]] of those days, [[H3118]] I, [[H576]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] looked up [[H5870]] to heaven, [[H8065]] and my sanity [[H4486]] was restored [[H8421]] to me. [[H5922]] Then I praised [[H1289]] the Most High, [[H5943]] and I honored [[H7624]] and glorified [[H1922]] Him who lives [[H2417]] forever: [[H5957]] “For His dominion [[H7985]] is an everlasting [[H5957]] dominion, [[H7985]] and His kingdom [[H4437]] endures from [[H5974]] generation [[H1859]] to generation. [[H1859]] 
35 All [[H3606]] the peoples [[H1753]] of the earth [[H772]] are counted [[H2804]] as nothing, [[H3809]] and He does [[H5648]] as He pleases [[H6634]] with the army [[H2429]] of heaven [[H8065]] and the peoples [[H1753]] of the earth. [[H772]] There is [[H383]] no [[H3809]] one who [[H1768]] can restrain [[H4223]] His hand [[H3028]] or say [[H560]] to Him,  ‘What [[H4101]] have You done?’” [[H5648]] 
36 At  the same time [[H2166]] my sanity [[H4486]] was restored [[H8421]] to me, [[H5922]] and my honor [[H1923]] and splendor [[H2122]] returned [[H8421]] to me [[H5922]] for the glory [[H3367]] of my kingdom. [[H4437]] My advisers [[H1907]] and nobles [[H7261]] sought me out, [[H1156]] and I was restored [[H8627]] to [[H5922]] my throne, [[H4437]] and surpassing [[H3493]] greatness [[H7238]] was added [[H3255]] to me.  
37 Now [[H3705]] I, [[H576]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] praise [[H7624]] and exalt [[H7313]] and glorify [[H1922]] the King [[H4430]] of heaven, [[H8065]] for [[H1768]] all [[H3606]] His works [[H4567]] are true, [[H7187]] and all His ways [[H735]] are just. [[H1780]] And those [[H1768]] who walk [[H1981]] in pride [[H1467]] He is able [[H3202]] to humble. [[H8214]]
