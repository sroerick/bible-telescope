[[Daniel 7|←]] • [[Daniel 9|→]]
1 In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of King [[H4428]] Belshazzar, [[H1112]] a vision [[H2377]] appeared [[H7200]] to me, [[H413]] Daniel, [[H1840]] subsequent [[H310]] to the one that had appeared [[H7200]] to me [[H413]] previously. [[H8462]] 
2 And in the vision [[H2377]] I saw [[H7200]] myself [[H589]] in the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa, [[H7800]] in the province [[H4082]] of Elam. [[H5867]] I saw [[H7200]] in the vision [[H2377]] that I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] beside [[H5921]] the Ulai [[H195]] Canal. [[H180]] 
3 Then I lifted [[H5375]] my eyes [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] a ram [[H352]] with  two horns [[H7161]] standing [[H5975]] beside [[H6440]] the canal. [[H180]] The horns [[H7161]] were long, [[H1364]] but one [[H259]] was longer [[H1364]] than [[H4480]] the other, [[H8145]] and the longer [[H1364]] one grew up [[H5927]] later. [[H314]] 
4 I saw [[H7200]] the ram [[H352]] charging [[H5055]] toward the west [[H3220]] and the north [[H6828]] and the south. [[H5045]] No [[H3605]] animal [[H2416]] could stand [[H5975]] against him, [[H6440]] and there was no [[H369]] deliverance [[H5337]] from his power. [[H3027]] He did [[H6213]] as he pleased [[H7522]] and became great. [[H1431]] 
5 As I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] contemplating all this, [[H995]] suddenly [[H2009]] a goat [[H6842]] with a prominent [[H2380]] horn [[H7161]] between [[H996]] his eyes [[H5869]] came [[H935]] out of [[H4480]] the west, [[H4628]] crossing [[H5921]] the surface [[H6440]] of the entire [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] without [[H369]] touching [[H5060]] the ground. [[H776]] 
6 He came [[H935]] toward [[H5704]] the two-horned [[H7161]] ram [[H352]] I had seen [[H7200]] standing [[H5975]] beside [[H6440]] the canal [[H180]] and rushed [[H7323]] at him [[H413]] with furious [[H2534]] power. [[H3581]] 
7 I saw [[H7200]] him approach [[H5060]] the ram [[H352]] in a rage [[H4843]] against him, [[H413]] and he struck [[H5221]] the ram [[H352]] and shattered [[H7665]] his two [[H8147]] horns. [[H7161]] The ram [[H352]] was [[H1961]] powerless [[H3581]] to stand [[H5975]] against him, [[H6440]] and the goat threw [[H7993]] him to the ground [[H776]] and trampled him, [[H7429]] [and] [[H1961]] no one [[H3808]] could deliver [[H5337]] the ram [[H352]] from his power. [[H3027]] 
8 Thus the goat [[H6842]] became [[H5704]] very [[H3966]] great, [[H1431]] but at the height of his power, [[H6105]] his large [[H1419]] horn [[H7161]] was broken off, [[H7665]] and four [[H702]] prominent [[H2380]] horns came up [[H5927]] in its place, [[H8478]] pointing toward the four [[H702]] winds [[H7307]] of heaven. [[H8064]] 
9 From [[H4480]] one [[H259]] of [these horns] [[H1992]] a [[H259]] little [[H4704]] horn [[H7161]] emerged [[H3318]] and grew [[H1431]] extensively [[H3499]] toward [[H413]] the south [[H5045]] and the east [[H4217]] and toward [[H413]] the Beautiful Land. [[H6643]] 
10 It grew as high [[H1431]] as [[H5704]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and it cast down [[H5307]] some of [[H4480]] the host [[H6635]] and [some] [[H4480]] of the stars [[H3556]] to the earth, [[H776]] and trampled them. [[H7429]] 
11 It magnified itself, [[H1431]] even to [[H5704]] the Prince [[H8269]] of the host; [[H6635]] it removed [[H7311]] His daily sacrifice [[H8548]] and overthrew [[H7993]] the place [[H4349]] of His sanctuary. [[H4720]] 
12 And on account of rebellion, [[H6588]] the host [[H6635]] [and] [[H5921]] the daily sacrifice [[H8548]] were given over [to the horn], [[H5414]] and it flung [[H7993]] truth [[H571]] to the ground [[H776]] and prospered [[H6743]] in whatever it did. [[H6213]] 
13 Then I heard [[H8085]] a [[H259]] holy one [[H6918]] speaking, [[H1696]] and another [[H259]] holy [[H6918]] one said [[H559]] to [him], [[H1696]] “How [[H5704]] long [until the fulfillment of] [[H4970]] the vision [[H2377]] of the daily sacrifice, [[H8548]] the rebellion [[H6588]] that causes desolation, [[H8074]] and the surrender [[H5414]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] and of the host [[H6635]] to be trampled?” [[H4823]] 
14 He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “It will take [[H5704]] 2,300 [[H505]] evenings [[H6153]] and mornings; [[H1242]] then the sanctuary [[H6944]] will be properly restored.” [[H6663]] 
15 While I, [[H589]] Daniel, [[H1840]] was watching [[H7200]] the vision [[H2377]] and trying to [[H1245]] understand it, [[H998]] there [[H2009]] stood [[H5975]] before me [[H5048]] one having the appearance [[H4758]] of a man. [[H1397]] 
16 And I heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of a man [[H120]] calling [[H7121]] from between [the banks of] [[H996]] the Ulai: [[H195]] “Gabriel, [[H1403]] explain [[H995]] the vision [[H4758]] to this man.” [[H1975]] 
17 As he came [[H935]] near [[H681]] to where I stood, [[H5975]] I was terrified [[H1204]] and fell [[H5307]] facedown. [[H5921]] “Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] he said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “understand [[H995]] that [[H3588]] the vision [[H2377]] concerns the time [[H6256]] of the end.” [[H7093]] 
18 While he was speaking [[H1696]] to me, [[H5973]] I fell into a deep sleep, [[H7290]] with [[H5921]] my face [[H6440]] to the ground. [[H776]] Then he touched me, [[H5060]] helped me to my feet [[H5975]] 
19 and said, [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] I will make known to you [[H3045]] what [[H834]] will happen [[H1961]] in the latter time [[H319]] of wrath, [[H2195]] because [[H3588]] it concerns the appointed time [[H4150]] of the end. [[H7093]] 
20 The two-horned [[H7161]] ram [[H352]] that [[H834]] you saw [[H7200]] represents the kings [[H4428]] of Media [[H4074]] and Persia. [[H6539]] 
21 The shaggy [[H8163]] goat [[H6842]] represents the king [[H4428]] of Greece, [[H3120]] and the large [[H1419]] horn [[H7161]] between [[H996]] his eyes [[H5869]] is [[H1931]] the first [[H7223]] king. [[H4428]] 
22 The four [horns] [[H702]] that replaced [[H8478]] the broken [one] [[H7665]] represent four [[H702]] kingdoms [[H4438]] that will rise [[H5975]] from that nation, [[H1471]] but will not have [[H3808]] the same power. [[H3581]] 
23 In the latter part [[H319]] of their reign, [[H4438]] when the rebellion [[H6586]] has reached its full measure, [[H8552]] an insolent [[H5794]] king, [[H4428]] skilled [[H995]] in intrigue, [[H2420]] will come to the throne. [[H5975]] 
24 His power [[H3581]] will be great, [[H6105]] but it [[H3581]] will not be his own. [[H3808]] He will cause terrible destruction [[H7843]] and succeed [[H6743]] in whatever he does. [[H6213]] He will destroy [[H7843]] the mighty men [[H6099]] along with the holy [[H6918]] people. [[H5971]] 
25 Through [[H5921]] his craft [[H7922]] and by his hand, [[H3027]] he will cause deceit [[H4820]] to prosper, [[H6743]] and in his own mind [[H3824]] he will make himself great. [[H1431]] In a time of peace [[H7962]] he will destroy [[H7843]] many, [[H7227]] and he will even stand [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] the Prince [[H8269]] of princes. [[H8269]] Yet he will be broken off, [[H7665]] but not [[H657]] by human hands. [[H3027]] 
26 The vision [[H4758]] of the evenings [[H6153]] and the mornings [[H1242]] that [[H834]] has been spoken [[H559]] is true. [[H571]] Now you [[H859]] must seal up [[H5640]] the vision, [[H2377]] for [[H3588]] it concerns the distant [[H7227]] future.” [[H3117]] 
27 I, [[H589]] Daniel, [[H1840]] was exhausted [[H1961]] and lay ill [[H2470]] for days. [[H3117]] Then I got up [[H6965]] and went about [[H6213]] the king’s [[H4428]] business. [[H4399]] I was devastated [[H8074]] by [[H5921]] the vision; [[H4758]] it was beyond [[H369]] understanding. [[H995]]
