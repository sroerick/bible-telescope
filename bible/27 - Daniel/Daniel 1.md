# Daniel 1
[[Ezekiel 48|←]] • [[Daniel 2|→]]
1 In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] came [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and besieged [[H6696]] it. [[H5921]] 
2 And the Lord [[H136]] delivered [[H5414]] into his hand [[H3027]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] along with some [[H7117]] of the articles [[H3627]] from the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]] He carried [these] off [[H935]] to the land [[H776]] of Shinar, [[H8152]] to the house [[H1004]] of his god, [[H430]] [where] [[H853]] he put [[H935]] [them] [[H3627]] into the treasury [[H1004]] of his god. [[H430]] 
3 Then the king [[H4428]] ordered [[H559]] Ashpenaz, [[H828]] the chief [[H7227]] of his court officials, [[H5631]] to bring in [[H935]] some [[H4480]] Israelites [[H1121]] from the royal [[H4410]] family [[H2233]] and the nobility— [[H6579]] 
4 young men [[H3206]] without [[H369]] blemish, [[H3971]] handsome, [[H2896]] gifted [[H7919]] in all [[H3605]] wisdom, [[H2451]] knowledgeable, [[H3045]] quick [[H4093]] to understand, [[H995]] and qualified [[H3581]] to serve [[H5975]] in the king’s [[H4428]] palace— [[H1964]] and to teach them [[H3925]] the language [[H3956]] and literature [[H5612]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] 
5 The king [[H4428]] assigned [[H4487]] them  daily [[H3117]] provisions [[H1697]] of the royal [[H4428]] food [[H6598]] and wine. [[H3196]] They were to be trained [[H1431]] for three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] at the end [[H7117]] of which they were to enter [[H5975]] the king’s service. [[H4428]] 
6 Among these [young men]  were some [[H1961]] [from] [[H1121]] Judah: [[H3063]] Daniel, [[H1840]] Hananiah, [[H2608]] Mishael, [[H4332]] and Azariah. [[H5838]] 
7 The chief [[H8269]] official [[H5631]] gave [[H7760]] them new names: [[H8034]] To Daniel [[H1840]] he gave [[H7760]] the name Belteshazzar; [[H1095]] to Hananiah, [[H2608]] Shadrach; [[H7714]] to Mishael, [[H4332]] Meshach; [[H4335]] and to Azariah, [[H5838]] Abednego. [[H5664]] 
8 But Daniel [[H1840]] resolved [[H7760]] in [[H5921]] his heart [[H3820]] that [[H834]] he would not [[H3808]] defile [[H1351]] himself with the king’s [[H4428]] food [[H6598]] or wine. [[H3196]] So he asked [[H1245]] the chief [[H8269]] official [[H5631]] for permission [[H834]] not [[H3808]] to defile himself. [[H1351]] 
9 Now God [[H430]] had granted [[H5414]] Daniel [[H1840]] favor [[H2617]] and compassion [[H7356]] from [[H6440]] the chief [[H8269]] official, [[H5631]] 
10 but he [[H8269]] said [[H559]] to Daniel, [[H1840]] “I [[H589]] fear [[H3373]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] who [[H834]] has assigned [[H4487]] your food [[H3978]] and drink. [[H4960]] For [[H834]] why [[H4100]] should he see [[H7200]] your faces [[H6440]] looking thinner [[H2196]] than [[H4480]] those of the other young men [[H3206]] your age? [[H1524]] You would endanger [[H2325]] my head [[H7218]] before the king. [[H4428]] 
11 Then Daniel [[H1840]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the steward [[H4453]] whom [[H834]] the chief [[H8269]] official [[H5631]] had set [[H4487]] over [[H5921]] Daniel, [[H1840]] Hananiah, [[H2608]] Mishael, [[H4332]] and Azariah, [[H5838]] 
12 “Please [[H4994]] test [[H5254]] your servants [[H5650]] for ten [[H6235]] days. [[H3117]] Let us be given [[H5414]] only vegetables [[H2235]] to eat [[H398]] and water [[H4325]] to drink. [[H8354]] 
13 Then compare [[H7200]] our appearances [[H4758]] with those [[H4758]] of the young men [[H3206]] who are eating [[H398]] the royal [[H4428]] food, [[H6598]] and deal [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] your servants [[H5650]] according to what [[H834]] you see.” [[H7200]] 
14 So he consented [[H8085]] to this [[H2088]] and tested them [[H5254]] for ten [[H6235]] days. [[H3117]] 
15 And at [[H4480]] the end [[H7117]] of ten [[H6235]] days, [[H3117]] their appearance was [[H7200]] better [[H2896]] and healthier [[H1277]] than all [[H3605]] the young men [[H3206]] who were eating [[H398]] the king’s [[H4428]] food. [[H6598]] 
16 Thus [[H1961]] the steward [[H4453]] continued to withhold [[H5375]] their choice food [[H6598]] and the wine [[H3196]] they were to drink, [[H4960]] and he gave [[H5414]] them  vegetables [instead]. [[H2235]] 
17 To these [[H428]] four [[H702]] young men [[H3206]] God [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] knowledge [[H4093]] and understanding [[H7919]] in every kind [[H3605]] of literature [[H5612]] and wisdom. [[H2451]] And Daniel [[H1840]] had insight [[H995]] into all kinds [[H3605]] of visions [[H2377]] and dreams. [[H2472]] 
18 Now at the end [[H7117]] of the time [[H3117]] specified [[H559]] by the king, [[H4428]] the chief [[H8269]] official [[H5631]] presented [[H935]] them to [[H6440]] Nebuchadnezzar. [[H5019]] 
19 And the king [[H4428]] spoke with them, [[H1696]] and among [[H854]] all [the young men] [[H3605]] he found [[H4672]] no one [[H3808]] equal to Daniel, [[H1840]] Hananiah, [[H2608]] Mishael, [[H4332]] and Azariah. [[H5838]] So they entered [[H5975]] the king's service. [[H4428]] 
20 In every [[H3605]] matter [[H1697]] of wisdom [[H2451]] and understanding [[H998]] about which [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] consulted [[H1245]] them, [[H1992]] he found them [[H4672]] ten [[H6235]] times [[H3027]] better than [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the magicians [[H825]] and enchanters [[H2748]] in his entire [[H3605]] kingdom. [[H4438]] 
21 And Daniel [[H1840]] remained [[H1961]] there until [[H5704]] the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of King [[H4428]] Cyrus. [[H3566]]
