1 Now it [[H8232]] pleased [[H6925]] Darius [[H1868]] to appoint [[H6966]] 120 [[H3969]] satraps [[H324]] to rule [[H1934]] throughout [[H3606]] the kingdom, [[H4437]] 
2 and over [[H5924]] them three [[H8532]] administrators, [[H5632]] including Daniel, [[H1841]] to whom  these [[H459]] satraps [[H324]] were accountable [[H2941]] so that the king [[H4430]] would not [[H3809]] suffer loss. [[H5142]] 
3 Soon, [[H116]] by [[H6903]] his extraordinary [[H3493]] spirit, [[H7308]] Daniel [[H1841]] distinguished himself [[H5330]] among [[H5922]] the administrators [[H5632]] and satraps. [[H324]] So the king [[H4430]] planned [[H6246]] to set [[H6966]] him over [[H5922]] the whole [[H3606]] kingdom. [[H4437]] 
4 Thus [[H116]] the administrators [[H5632]] and satraps [[H324]] sought [[H1934]] a charge [[H5931]] against Daniel [[H1841]] concerning [[H6655]] the kingdom, [[H4437]] but they could [[H3202]] find [[H7912]] no [[H3606]] charge [[H5931]] or corruption, [[H7844]] because [[H6903]] he [[H1932]] was trustworthy, [[H540]] and no [[H3606]] negligence [[H7960]] or corruption [[H7844]] was found [[H7912]] in him. [[H5922]] 
5 Finally [[H116]] these [[H479]] men [[H1400]] said, [[H560]] “We will never [[H3809]] find [[H7912]] any [[H3606]] charge [[H5931]] against this [[H1836]] Daniel, [[H1841]] unless [[H3861]] we find [something] [[H7912]] against him [[H5922]] concerning the law [[H1882]] of his God.” [[H426]] 
6 So [[H116]] the administrators [[H5632]] and satraps [[H324]] went together [[H7284]] to [[H5922]] the king [[H4430]] and said, [[H560]] “O King [[H4430]] Darius, [[H1868]] may you live [[H2418]] forever! [[H5957]] 
7 All [[H3606]] the royal [[H4437]] administrators, [[H5632]] prefects, [[H5460]] satraps, [[H324]] advisers, [[H1907]] and governors [[H6347]] have agreed [[H3272]] that the king [[H4430]] should establish [[H6966]] an ordinance [[H7010]] and enforce [[H8631]] a decree [[H633]] that [[H1768]] for [[H5705]] thirty [[H8533]] days [[H3118]] anyone [[H3606]] who [[H1768]] petitions [[H1156]] any [[H3606]] god [[H426]] or man [[H606]] except you, [[H3861]] O king, [[H4430]] will be thrown [[H7412]] into the den [[H1358]] of lions. [[H744]] 
8 Therefore, [[H3705]] O king, [[H4430]] establish [[H6966]] the decree [[H633]] and sign [[H7560]] the document [[H3792]] so that [[H1768]] it cannot [[H3809]] be changed— [[H8133]] in accordance with the law [[H1882]] of the Medes [[H4076]] and Persians, [[H6540]] which [[H1768]] cannot [[H3809]] be repealed.” [[H5709]] 
9 Therefore [[H3606]] King [[H4430]] Darius [[H1868]] signed [[H7560]] the written [[H3792]] decree. [[H633]] 
10 Now when [[H1768]] Daniel [[H1841]] learned [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the document [[H3792]] had been signed, [[H7560]] he went [[H5954]] into his house, [[H1005]] where the windows [[H3551]] of his  upper room [[H5952]] opened [[H6606]] toward [[H5049]] Jerusalem, [[H3390]] and three [[H8532]] times [[H2166]] a day [[H3118]] he [[H1932]] got down [[H1289]] on [[H5922]] his knees, [[H1291]] prayed, [[H6739]] and gave thanks [[H3029]] to [[H6925]] his God, [[H426]] just as [[H6903]] he had done [[H5648]] before. [[H4481]] 
11 Then [[H116]] these [[H479]] men [[H1400]] went as a group [[H7284]] and found [[H7912]] Daniel [[H1841]] petitioning [[H1156]] and imploring [[H2604]] his God. [[H426]] 
12 So [[H116]] they approached [[H7127]] the king [[H4430]] and asked [[H560]] about [[H5922]] his royal [[H4430]] decree: [[H633]] “Did you not [[H3809]] sign [[H7560]] a decree [[H633]] that [[H1768]] for [[H5705]] thirty [[H8533]] days [[H3118]] any [[H3606]] man [[H606]] who [[H1768]] petitions [[H1156]] any [[H3606]] god [[H426]] or man [[H606]] except you, [[H3861]] O king, [[H4430]] will be thrown [[H7412]] into the den [[H1358]] of lions? [[H744]] The king [[H4430]] replied, [[H6032]] “According to the law [[H1882]] of the Medes [[H4076]] and Persians, [[H6540]] the order [[H4406]] stands [[H3330]] and it cannot [[H3809]] be repealed. [[H5709]] 
13 Then [[H116]] they told [[H6032]] the king, [[H4430]] “Daniel, [[H1841]] one [[H1768]] of [[H4481]] the exiles [[H1123]] from [[H1768]] Judah, [[H3061]] shows no [[H3809]] regard [[H7761]] for you, [[H5921]] O king, [[H4430]] or for the decree [[H633]] that [[H1768]] you have signed. [[H7560]] He still makes [[H1156]] his petition [[H1159]] three [[H8532]] times [[H2166]] a day.” [[H3118]] 
14 As soon as [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] heard [[H8086]] this, [[H4406]] he was deeply [[H7690]] distressed [[H888]] and set [[H7761]] [his] mind [[H1079]] on delivering [[H7804]] Daniel, [[H1841]] and he labored [[H7712]] until [[H5705]] sundown [[H4606]] to rescue him. [[H5338]] 
15 Then [[H116]] the [[H479]] men [[H1400]] approached [[H7284]] the king {together} [[H4430]] and said [[H560]] to him, [[H4430]] “Remember, [[H3046]] O king, [[H4430]] that by the law [[H1882]] of the Medes [[H4076]] and Persians [[H6540]] no [[H3809]] decree [[H633]] or ordinance [[H7010]] established [[H6966]] by the king [[H4430]] can be changed.” [[H8133]] 
16 So [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] gave the order, [[H560]] and they brought [[H858]] Daniel [[H1841]] and threw him [[H7412]] into the den [[H1358]] of [[H1768]] lions. [[H744]] The king [[H4430]] said [[H6032]] to Daniel, [[H1841]] “May your God, [[H426]] whom [[H1768]] you [[H607]] serve continually, [[H6399]] deliver you!” [[H7804]] 
17 A [[H2298]] stone [[H69]] was brought [[H858]] and placed [[H7761]] over [[H5922]] the mouth [[H6433]] of the den, [[H1358]] and the king [[H4430]] sealed it [[H2857]] with his own signet ring [[H5824]] and with the rings [[H5824]] of his nobles, [[H7261]] so that [[H1768]] nothing [[H3809]] concerning Daniel [[H1841]] could be changed. [[H8133]] 
18 Then [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] went [[H236]] to his palace [[H1965]] and spent the night [[H956]] fasting. [[H2908]] No [[H3809]] entertainment [[H1761]] was brought [[H5954]] before him, [[H6925]] and sleep [[H8139]] fled [[H5075]] from him. [[H5922]] 
19 At the first light [[H5053]] of dawn, [[H8238]] the king [[H4430]] got up [[H6966]] and hurried [[H927]] to the den [[H1358]] of [[H1768]] lions. [[H744]] 
20 When he reached [[H7127]] the den, [[H1358]] he cried out [[H2200]] in a voice [[H7032]] of anguish, [[H6088]] “O Daniel, [[H1841]] servant [[H5649]] of the living [[H2417]] God, [[H426]] has your God, [[H426]] whom [[H1768]] you [[H607]] serve [[H6399]] continually, [[H8411]] been able [[H3202]] to deliver you [[H7804]] from [[H4481]] the lions?” [[H744]] 
21 Then [[H116]] Daniel [[H1841]] replied, [[H4449]] “O king, [[H4430]] may you live [[H2418]] forever! [[H5957]] 
22 My God [[H426]] sent [[H7972]] His angel [[H4398]] and shut [[H5463]] the mouths [[H6433]] of the lions. [[H744]] They have not [[H3809]] hurt me, [[H2255]] for [[H6903]] I was found [[H7912]] innocent [[H2136]] in His sight, [[H6925]] and [[H638]] I have done [[H5648]] no [[H3809]] wrong [[H2248]] against you, [[H6925]] O king.” [[H4430]] 
23 The king [[H4430]] was overjoyed [[H7690]] and gave orders [[H560]] to lift [[H5267]] Daniel [[H1841]] out of [[H4481]] the den, [[H1358]] and when Daniel [[H1841]] was lifted [[H5267]] out of [[H4481]] the den, [[H1358]] no [[H3809]] wounds whatsoever [[H2257]] were found [[H7912]] on him,  because [[H1768]] he had trusted [[H540]] in his God. [[H426]] 
24 At the command [[H560]] of the king, [[H4430]] the [[H479]] men [[H1400]] who [[H1768]] had falsely accused [[H399]] Daniel [[H1841]] were brought [[H858]] and thrown [[H7412]] into the den [[H1358]] of lions— [[H744]] they [[H581]] and their children [[H1123]] and wives. [[H5389]] And before [[H3809]] they had reached [[H4291]] the bottom [[H773]] of the den, [[H1358]] the lions [[H744]] overpowered [[H7981]] them  and crushed [[H1855]] all [[H3606]] their bones. [[H1635]] 
25 Then [[H116]] King [[H4430]] Darius [[H1868]] wrote [[H3790]] to all [[H3606]] the peoples, [[H5972]] nations, [[H524]] and [men of every] language [[H3961]] throughout [[H1753]] the land: [[H772]] “May your prosperity [[H8001]] abound. [[H7680]] 
26 I hereby [[H7761]] decree [[H2942]] that [[H1768]] in every [[H3606]] part [[H7985]] of my kingdom, [[H4437]] [men are to] tremble [[H2112]] in fear [[H1763]] before [[H4481]] the God [[H426]] of [[H1768]] Daniel: [[H1841]] For [[H1768]] He [[H1932]] is the living [[H2417]] God, [[H426]] and He endures forever; [[H7011]] His kingdom [[H4437]] will never [[H3809]] be destroyed, [[H2255]] and His dominion [[H7985]] will never end. [[H5491]] 
27 He delivers [[H7804]] and rescues; [[H5338]] He performs [[H5648]] signs [[H852]] and wonders [[H8540]] in the heavens [[H8065]] and on the earth, [[H772]] for He [[H1768]] has rescued [[H7804]] Daniel [[H1841]] from [[H4481]] the power [[H3028]] of the lions.” [[H744]] 
28 So Daniel [[H1841]] prospered [[H6744]] during the reigns [[H4437]] of Darius [[H1868]] and [[H4437]] of Cyrus [[H3567]] the Persian. [[H6543]]
