1 [Many years later] King [[H4430]] Belshazzar [[H1113]] held [[H5648]] a great [[H7229]] feast [[H3900]] for a thousand [[H506]] of his nobles, [[H7261]] and he drank [[H8355]] wine [[H2562]] with [[H6903]] them. [[H506]] 
2 Under the influence of the wine, [[H2562]] Belshazzar [[H1113]] gave orders [[H560]] to bring [[H858]] in the gold [[H1722]] and silver [[H3702]] vessels [[H3984]] that [[H1768]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] his father [[H2]] had taken [[H5312]] from [[H4481]] the temple [[H1965]] in Jerusalem, [[H3390]] so that the king [[H4430]] could drink [[H8355]] from them,  along with his nobles, [[H7261]] his wives, [[H7695]] and his concubines. [[H3904]] 
3 Thus [[H116]] they brought in [[H858]] the gold [[H1722]] vessels [[H3984]] that [[H1768]] had been taken [[H5312]] from [[H4481]] the temple, [[H1965]] the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] in Jerusalem, [[H3390]] and the king [[H4430]] drank [[H8355]] from them,  along with his nobles, [[H7261]] his wives, [[H7695]] and his concubines. [[H3904]] 
4 As they drank [[H8355]] the wine, [[H2562]] they praised [[H7624]] their gods [[H426]] of gold [[H1722]] and silver, [[H3702]] bronze [[H5174]] and iron, [[H6523]] wood [[H636]] and stone. [[H69]] 
5 At  that moment [[H8160]] the fingers [[H677]] of [[H1768]] a human [[H606]] hand [[H3028]] appeared [[H5312]] and wrote [[H3790]] on [[H5922]] the plaster [[H1528]] of [[H1768]] the wall, [[H3797]] near [[H6903]] the lampstand [[H5043]] in [[H1768]] the royal [[H4430]] palace. [[H1965]] As the king [[H4430]] watched [[H2370]] the hand [[H6447]] that [[H1768]] was writing, [[H3790]] 
6 his face [[H2122]] grew pale [[H8133]] and his thoughts [[H7476]] so alarmed him [[H927]] that his hips [[H2783]] gave way [[H8271]] and his knees [[H755]] knocked together. [[H1668]] 
7 The king [[H4430]] called out for [[H7123]] the enchanters, [[H826]] astrologers, [[H3779]] and diviners [[H1505]] to be brought in, [[H5954]] and he [[H4430]] said [[H560]] to these wise men [[H2445]] of Babylon, [[H895]] “Whoever [[H1768]] reads [[H7123]] this [[H1836]] inscription [[H3792]] and tells me [[H2324]] its interpretation [[H6591]] will be clothed [[H3848]] in purple [[H711]] and have a gold [[H1722]] chain [[H2002]] placed around [[H5922]] his neck, [[H6676]] and he will be made the third [[H8523]] highest ruler [[H7981]] in the kingdom. [[H4437]] 
8 So [[H116]] all [[H3606]] the king’s [[H4430]] wise men [[H2445]] came in, [[H5954]] but they could [[H3546]] not [[H3809]] read [[H7123]] the inscription [[H3792]] or interpret it [[H6591]] for [him]. [[H4430]] 
9 Then [[H116]] King [[H4430]] Belshazzar [[H1113]] became even more [[H7690]] terrified, [[H927]] his face [[H2122]] grew even more pale, [[H8133]] and his nobles [[H7261]] were bewildered. [[H7672]] 
10 Hearing [[H6903]] the outcry [[H4406]] of the king [[H4430]] and his nobles, [[H7261]] the queen [[H4433]] entered [[H5954]] the banquet [[H4961]] hall. [[H1005]] “O king, [[H4430]] may you live [[H2418]] forever,” [[H5957]] she said. [[H560]] “Do not [[H409]] let your thoughts [[H7476]] terrify you, [[H927]] or your face [[H2122]] grow pale. [[H8133]] 
11 There is [[H383]] a man [[H1400]] in your kingdom [[H4437]] who [[H1768]] has the spirit [[H7308]] of the holy [[H6922]] gods in him. [[H426]] In the days [[H3118]] of your father [[H2]] he was found [[H7912]] to have insight, [[H5094]] intelligence, [[H7924]] and wisdom [[H2452]] like [that] [[H2452]] of the gods. [[H426]] Your father, [[H2]] King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] appointed [[H6966]] him chief [[H7229]] of the magicians, [[H2749]] enchanters, [[H826]] astrologers, [[H3779]] [and] diviners. [[H1505]] Your own father, [[H2]] the king, [[H4430]] 
12 did this [[H3606]] because [[H6903]] Daniel, [[H1841]] the one [[H1768]] [he] [[H4430]] named [[H7761]] Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] was found [[H7912]] to have an extraordinary [[H3493]] spirit, [[H7308]] as well as knowledge, [[H4486]] understanding, [[H7924]] and the ability to interpret [[H6590]] dreams, [[H2493]] explain [[H263]] riddles, [[H280]] and solve [[H8271]] difficult problems. [[H7001]] Summon [[H7123]] Daniel, [[H1841]] therefore, [[H3705]] and he will give you [[H2324]] the interpretation. [[H6591]] 
13 So [[H116]] Daniel [[H1841]] was brought [[H5954]] before [[H6925]] the king, [[H4430]] [who] [[H4430]] asked [[H560]] him, [[H1841]] “Are you [[H607]] Daniel, [[H1841]] one [[H1768]] of [[H4481]] the exiles [[H1123]] my father [[H2]] the king [[H4430]] brought [[H858]] from [[H4481]] Judah? [[H3061]] 
14 I have heard [[H8086]] that [[H1768]] the spirit [[H7308]] of the gods [[H426]] is in you,  and that you have insight, [[H5094]] intelligence, [[H7924]] and extraordinary [[H3493]] wisdom. [[H2452]] 
15 Now [[H3705]] the wise men [[H2445]] and enchanters [[H826]] were brought [[H5954]] before me [[H6925]] to read [[H7123]] this [[H1836]] inscription [[H3792]] and interpret it [[H6591]] for me, [[H3046]] but they could [[H3546]] not [[H3809]] give [[H2324]] its [[H4406]] interpretation. [[H6591]] 
16 But [[H576]] I have heard [[H8086]] about you, [[H5922]] that [[H1768]] you are able [[H3202]] to give interpretations [[H6591]] and solve [[H8271]] difficult problems. [[H7001]] Therefore, [[H3705]] if [[H2006]] you can [[H3202]] read [[H7123]] this inscription [[H3792]] and give [[H3046]] me its interpretation, [[H6591]] you will be clothed [[H3848]] in purple [[H711]] and have a gold [[H1722]] chain [[H2002]] placed around [[H1768]] your neck, [[H6676]] and you will be made the third [[H8531]] highest ruler [[H7981]] in the kingdom. [[H4437]] 
17 In response, [[H116]] Daniel [[H1841]] said [[H560]] to the king, [[H4430]] “You may keep [[H1934]] your gifts [[H4978]] for yourself  and give [[H3052]] your rewards [[H5023]] to someone else. [[H321]] Nevertheless, [[H1297]] I will read [[H7123]] the inscription [[H3792]] for the king [[H4430]] and interpret it [[H6591]] for him. [[H3046]] 
18 As for you, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] the Most High [[H5943]] God [[H426]] gave [[H3052]] your father [[H2]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] sovereignty [[H4437]] and greatness, [[H7238]] glory [[H3367]] and honor. [[H1923]] 
19 Because of [[H4481]] the greatness [[H7238]] that [[H1768]] He bestowed [[H3052]] on him,  all [[H3606]] peoples, [[H5972]] nations, [[H524]] and [men of every] language [[H3961]] trembled [[H1934]] in fear [[H1763]] before him. [[H6925]] He killed [[H6992]] whom he wished [[H6634]] and kept alive [[H2418]] whom [[H1768]] he wished; [[H6634]] he exalted [[H7313]] whom [[H1768]] he wished [[H6634]] and humbled [[H8214]] whom [[H1768]] he wished. [[H6634]] 
20 But when [[H1768]] his heart [[H3825]] was exalted [[H7313]] and his spirit [[H7308]] hardened [[H8631]] in pride, [[H2103]] he was deposed [[H5182]] from [[H4481]] his royal [[H4437]] throne, [[H3764]] and his glory [[H3367]] was taken [[H5709]] from him. [[H4481]] 
21 He was driven away [[H2957]] from [[H4481]] mankind, [[H1123]] and his mind [[H3825]] was like [[H5974]] [that of] a beast. [[H2423]] He lived [[H4070]] with [[H5974]] the wild donkeys [[H6167]] and ate [[H2939]] grass [[H6211]] like cattle, [[H8450]] and his body [[H1655]] was drenched [[H6647]] with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven [[H8065]] until [[H5705]] he acknowledged [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the Most High [[H5943]] God [[H426]] is ruler [[H7990]] over the kingdom [[H4437]] of mankind, [[H606]] and He sets [[H6966]] over it [[H5921]] whom [[H4479]] He wishes. [[H6634]] 
22 But you [[H607]] his son, [[H1247]] O Belshazzar, [[H1113]] have not [[H3809]] humbled [[H8214]] your heart, [[H3825]] even though [[H6903]] you knew [[H3046]] all [[H3606]] this. [[H1836]] 
23 Instead, you have exalted [[H7313]] yourself against [[H5922]] the Lord [[H4756]] of heaven. [[H8065]] The vessels [[H3984]] from [[H1768]] His house [[H1005]] were brought [[H858]] to you, [[H6925]] and as you [[H607]] drank [[H8355]] wine from them [[H2562]] with your nobles, [[H7261]] wives, [[H7695]] and concubines, [[H3904]] you praised [[H7624]] gods [[H426]] of silver [[H3702]] and gold, [[H1722]] bronze [[H5174]] and iron, [[H6523]] wood [[H636]] and stone, [[H69]] which [[H1768]] cannot [[H3809]] see [[H2370]] or [[H3809]] hear [[H8086]] or [[H3809]] understand. [[H3046]] But you have failed to [[H3809]] glorify [[H1922]] the God [[H426]] who [holds] [[H1768]] in His hand [[H3028]] your very breath [[H5396]] and all [[H3606]] your ways. [[H735]] 
24 Therefore [[H116]] He sent [[H7972]] the hand [[H3028]] that wrote [[H7560]] the [[H1836]] inscription. [[H3792]] 
25 Now this [[H1836]] is the inscription [[H3792]] that [[H1768]] was written: [[H7560]] MENE, [[H4484]] MENE, [[H4484]] TEKEL, [[H8625]] PARSIN. [[H6537]] 
26 [And] this [[H1836]] is the interpretation [[H6591]] of the message: [[H4406]] MENE [[H4484]] means that God [[H426]] has numbered [[H4483]] the days of your reign [[H4437]] and brought it to an end. [[H8000]] 
27 TEKEL [[H8625]] means that you have been weighed [[H8625]] on the scales [[H3977]] and found [[H7912]] deficient. [[H2627]] 
28 PERES [[H6537]] means that your kingdom [[H4437]] has been divided [[H6537]] and given over [[H3052]] to the Medes [[H4076]] and Persians.” [[H6540]] 
29 Then [[H116]] Belshazzar [[H1113]] gave the command, [[H560]] and they clothed [[H3848]] Daniel [[H1841]] in purple, [[H711]] placed a gold [[H1722]] chain [[H2002]] around [[H5922]] his neck, [[H6676]] and proclaimed [[H3745]] him [[H5922]] the third highest [[H8531]] ruler [[H7990]] in the kingdom. [[H4437]] 
30 That very night [[H3916]] Belshazzar [[H1113]] king [[H4430]] of the Chaldeans [[H3779]] was slain, [[H6992]] 
31 and Darius [[H1868]] the Mede  received [[H6902]] the kingdom [[H4437]] at the age [[H1247]] of sixty-two. [[H8361]]
