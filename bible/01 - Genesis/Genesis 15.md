# Genesis 15
[[Genesis 14|←]] • [[Genesis 16|→]]
1 After [[H310]] these [[H428]] events, [[H1697]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Abram [[H87]] in a vision: [[H4236]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] Abram. [[H87]] I [am] [[H595]] your shield, [[H4043]] your very [[H3966]] great [[H7235]] reward.” [[H7939]] 
2 But Abram [[H87]] replied, [[H559]] “O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] what [[H4100]] can You give me, [[H5414]] since I [[H595]] remain [[H1980]] childless, [[H6185]] and the heir [[H1121]] of my house [[H1004]] is Eliezer [[H461]] of Damascus?” [[H1834]] 
3 Abram [[H87]] continued, [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] You have given [[H5414]] me no [[H3808]] offspring, [[H2233]] so a servant [[H1121]] in my household [[H1004]] will be my heir.” [[H3423]] 
4 Then [[H2009]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came to him, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] one will not [[H3808]] be your heir, [[H3423]] but [[H3588]] one [[H1931]] who [[H834]] comes from [[H3318]] your own body [[H4578]] will be your heir.” [[H3423]] 
5 And [the LORD] took [[H3318]] him [[H853]] outside [[H2351]] and said, [[H559]] “Now [[H4994]] look [[H5027]] to the heavens [[H8064]] and count [[H5608]] the stars, [[H3556]] if you [[H518]] are able.” [[H3201]] Then He declared, [[H559]] “So {shall} [[H3541]] your offspring [[H2233]] be.” [[H1961]] 
6 Abram believed [[H539]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and it was credited [[H2803]] to him  as righteousness. [[H6666]] 
7 [The LORD] also told [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] brought you [[H3318]] out of Ur [[H218]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] to give [[H5414]] you  this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to possess.” [[H3423]] 
8 But [Abram] replied, [[H559]] “Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] how [[H4100]] can I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I will possess it?” [[H3423]] 
9 And [the LORD] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Bring [[H3947]] Me  a heifer, [[H5697]] a goat, [[H5795]] and a ram, [[H352]] [each] three years old, [[H8027]] along with a turtledove [[H8449]] and a young pigeon.” [[H1469]] 
10 So [Abram] brought [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] these to Him, [[H428]] split [[H1334]] each of them [[H853]] down the middle, [[H8432]] and laid [[H5414]] the halves [[H1335]] opposite [[H7125]] each [[H376]] other. [[H7453]] The birds, [[H6833]] however, [[H853]] he did not [[H3808]] cut. [[H1334]] 
11 And the birds of prey [[H5861]] descended [[H3381]] on [[H5921]] the carcasses, [[H6297]] but Abram [[H87]] drove them away. [[H5380]] 
12 As the sun [[H8121]] was [[H1961]] setting, [[H935]] Abram [[H87]] fell [[H5307]] into [[H5921]] a deep sleep, [[H8639]] and suddenly [[H2009]] great [[H1419]] terror [[H367]] and darkness [[H2825]] overwhelmed [[H5307]] him. [[H5921]] 
13 Then the LORD said [[H559]] to Abram, [[H87]] “Know [[H3045]] for certain [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] your descendants [[H2233]] will be [[H1961]] strangers [[H1616]] in a land [[H776]] that is not their own; [[H3808]] they will be enslaved [[H5647]] and mistreated [[H6031]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] years. [[H8141]] 
14 But [[H1571]] I [[H595]] will judge [[H1777]] the nation [[H1471]] they serve as slaves, [[H5647]] and afterward [[H310]] they will depart [[H3318]] with many [[H1419]] possessions. [[H7399]] 
15 You, however, [[H859]] will go [[H935]] to [[H413]] your fathers [[H1]] in peace [[H7965]] and be buried [[H6912]] at a ripe old age. [[H7872]] 
16 In the fourth [[H7243]] generation [[H1755]] [your descendants] will return [[H7725]] here, [[H2008]] for [[H3588]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the Amorites [[H567]] [is] not [[H3808]] yet [[H5704]] complete.” [[H8003]] 
17 When the sun [[H8121]] had set [[H935]] and darkness [[H5939]] had fallen, [[H1961]] behold, [[H2009]] a smoking [[H6227]] firepot [[H8574]] and a flaming [[H784]] torch [[H3940]] appeared and passed [[H5674]] between [[H996]] the halves [[H1506]] [of the carcasses]. [[H428]] 
18 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Abram, [[H87]] saying, [[H559]] “To your descendants [[H2233]] I have given [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] land— [[H776]] from the river [[H5104]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to [[H5704]] the great [[H1419]] River [[H5104]] Euphrates— [[H6578]] 
19 the land of the Kenites, [[H7017]] Kenizzites, [[H7074]] Kadmonites, [[H6935]] 
20 Hittites, [[H2850]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Rephaites, [[H7497]] 
21 Amorites, [[H567]] Canaanites, [[H3669]] Girgashites, [[H1622]] and Jebusites.” [[H2983]]
