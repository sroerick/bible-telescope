[[Genesis 41|←]] • [[Genesis 43|→]]
1 When Jacob [[H3290]] learned [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] there was [[H3426]] grain [[H7668]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] he [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to his sons, [[H1121]] “Why [[H4100]] are you staring at one another?” [[H7200]] 
2 “Look,” [[H2009]] he added, [[H559]] “I have heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] grain [[H7668]] in Egypt. [[H4714]] Go down [[H3381]] there [[H8033]] and buy [[H7666]] some for us,  so that we may live [[H2421]] and not [[H3808]] die.” [[H4191]] 
3 So ten [[H6235]] of Joseph’s [[H3130]] brothers [[H251]] went down [[H3381]] to buy [[H7666]] grain [[H1250]] from Egypt. [[H4714]] 
4 But Jacob [[H3290]] did not [[H3808]] send [[H7971]] Joseph’s [[H3130]] brother [[H251]] Benjamin [[H1144]] with [[H854]] his brothers, [[H251]] for [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] “I am afraid that [[H6435]] harm [[H611]] might befall him.” [[H7122]] 
5 So the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were among [[H8432]] those who [[H935]] came [[H935]] to buy grain, [[H7666]] since [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] had [also] spread [[H1961]] to the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]] 
6 Now Joseph [[H3130]] was the ruler [[H7989]] of [[H5921]] the land, [[H776]] who [[H1931]] sold grain [[H7666]] to all [[H3605]] its [[H776]] people. [[H5971]] So when [his] [[H3130]] brothers [[H251]] arrived, [[H935]] they bowed down [[H7812]] before him  with their faces [[H639]] to the ground. [[H776]] 
7 When Joseph [[H3130]] saw [[H7200]] his brothers, [[H251]] he recognized them, [[H5234]] but he treated them as strangers [[H5234]] and spoke [[H1696]] harshly [[H7186]] to them. [[H854]] “Where [[H370]] have you come from?” [[H935]] he asked. [[H559]] “From the land [[H776]] of Canaan,” [[H3667]] they replied. [[H559]] “[We are here] to buy [[H7666]] food.” [[H400]] 
8 Although Joseph [[H3130]] recognized [[H5234]] his brothers, [[H251]] they [[H1992]] did not [[H3808]] recognize him. [[H5234]] 
9 Joseph [[H3130]] remembered [[H2142]] his dreams [[H2472]] about them  and said, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] are spies! [[H7270]] You have come [[H935]] to see [[H7200]] if our land [[H776]] [is] vulnerable.” [[H6172]] 
10 “Not so, [[H3808]] my lord,” [[H113]] they replied. [[H559]] “Your servants [[H5650]] have come [[H935]] to buy [[H7666]] food. [[H400]] 
11 We [[H5168]] are all [[H3605]] sons [[H1121]] of one [[H259]] man. [[H376]] Your servants [[H5650]] are [[H1961]] honest [men], [[H3651]] not [[H3808]] spies.” [[H7270]] 
12 “No,” [[H3808]] he told [[H559]] them. [[H413]] “You have come [[H935]] to see [[H7200]] if our land [[H776]] [is] vulnerable.” [[H6172]] 
13 But they answered, [[H559]] “Your servants [[H5650]] are twelve [[H8147]] brothers, [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of one [[H259]] man [[H376]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]] The youngest [[H6996]] is now [[H3117]] with [[H854]] our father, [[H1]] and one [[H259]] is no more.” [[H369]] 
14 Then Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Just as I said, [[H1696]] you [[H859]] are spies! [[H7270]] 
15 And this is how [[H2063]] you will be tested: [[H974]] As surely as Pharaoh [[H6547]] lives, [[H2416]] you shall not [[H518]] leave [[H3318]] this [[H2088]] place unless [[H3588]] your youngest [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] comes [[H935]] here. [[H2008]] 
16 Send [[H7971]] one [[H259]] of your number [[H4480]] to get [[H3947]] your brother; [[H251]] the rest of you [[H859]] will be confined [[H631]] so that the truth [[H571]] of your words [[H1697]] may be tested. [[H974]] If [[H518]] they are untrue, [[H3808]] then as surely as Pharaoh [[H6547]] lives, [[H2416]] you [[H859]] are spies!” [[H7270]] 
17 So Joseph imprisoned them [[H622]] for three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] 
18 and on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] [he] [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] and you will live, [[H2421]] [for] I [[H589]] fear [[H3372]] God. [[H430]] 
19 If [[H518]] you [[H859]] are honest, [[H3651]] leave one [[H259]] of your brothers in custody [[H631]] while the rest of you [[H859]] go [[H1980]] and take back [[H935]] grain [[H7668]] to relieve the hunger [[H7459]] of your households. [[H1004]] 
20 Then [[H853]] bring [[H935]] your youngest [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] to me [[H413]] so that your words [[H1697]] can be verified, [[H539]] that you may not [[H3808]] die.” [[H4191]] And to this [[H3651]] they consented. [[H6213]] 
21 Then they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another, [[H251]] “Surely [[H61]] we [[H587]] are being punished [[H818]] because of [[H5921]] our brother. [[H251]] We saw [[H7200]] his [[H5315]] anguish [[H6869]] when he pleaded [[H2603]] with us, [[H413]] but we would not [[H3808]] listen. [[H8085]] That is why [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] distress [[H6869]] has come [[H935]] upon us. [[H413]] 
22 But Reuben [[H7205]] replied: [[H6030]] “Didn’t [[H3808]] I tell [[H559]] you not [[H408]] to sin against [[H2398]] the boy? [[H3206]] But you would not [[H3808]] listen. [[H8085]] Now [[H2009]] we must account for [[H1875]] his blood!” [[H1818]] 
23 They [[H1992]] did not [[H3808]] realize [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Joseph [[H3130]] understood them, [[H8085]] since [[H3588]] there was an interpreter [[H3887]] between them. [[H996]] 
24 And he turned away [[H5437]] from [[H5921]] them and wept. [[H1058]] When he turned back [[H7725]] and spoke [[H1696]] to them, [[H413]] he took [[H3947]] Simeon [[H8095]] from them [[H853]] and had him bound [[H631]] before their eyes. [[H5869]] 
25 Then Joseph [[H3130]] gave orders [[H6680]] to fill their bags [[H3627]] with [[H4390]] grain, [[H1250]] return [[H7725]] each [[H376]] man’s silver [[H3701]] to [[H413]] his sack, [[H8242]] and give [[H5414]] them provisions [[H6720]] for their journey. [[H1870]] This [[H3651]] order was carried out, [[H6213]] 
26 and they loaded [[H5375]] the grain [[H7668]] on [[H5921]] their donkeys [[H2543]] and departed. [[H1980]] 
27 At the place where they lodged for the night, [[H4411]] one [[H259]] of them opened [[H6605]] his sack [[H8242]] to get [[H5414]] feed [[H4554]] for his donkey, [[H2543]] and he saw [[H7200]] his silver [[H3701]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of the sack. [[H572]] 
28 “My money [[H3701]] has been returned!” [[H7725]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his brothers. [[H251]] “It is here [[H2009]] in my sack.” [[H572]] Their hearts [[H3820]] sank, [[H3318]] and trembling, [[H2729]] they turned to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another [[H251]] and said, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] is this [[H2063]] that God [[H430]] has done [[H6213]] to us?”  
29 When they reached [[H935]] their father [[H1]] Jacob [[H3290]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] they described [[H5046]] to  him all [[H3605]] that had happened to them: [[H7136]] 
30 “The man [[H582]] who is the lord [[H113]] of the land [[H776]] spoke [[H1696]] harshly [[H7186]] to us [[H854]] and accused us of spying [[H7270]] on the country. [[H776]] 
31 But we told [[H559]] him, [[H413]] ‘We [[H587]] are [[H1961]] honest men, [[H3651]] not [[H3808]] spies. [[H7270]] 
32 We [[H587]] are twelve [[H8147]] brothers, [[H251]] sons [[H1121]] of one father. [[H1]] One [[H259]] is no more, [[H369]] and the youngest [[H6996]] is now [[H3117]] with [[H854]] our father [[H1]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan.’ [[H3667]] 
33 Then the man [[H376]] who is the lord [[H113]] of the land [[H776]] said [[H559]] to us, [[H413]] ‘This is how [[H2063]] I will know [[H3045]] whether [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are honest: [[H3651]] Leave [[H3240]] one [[H259]] brother [[H251]] with me, [[H854]] take [[H3947]] food to relieve the hunger [[H7459]] of your households, [[H1004]] and go. [[H1980]] 
34 But bring [[H935]] your youngest [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] back to me [[H413]] so I will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are not [[H3808]] spies [[H7270]] but [[H3588]] honest men. [[H3651]] Then I will give your brother [[H251]] back to you, [[H5414]] and you can trade [[H5503]] in the land.’” [[H776]] 
35 As they [[H1992]] began emptying [[H7324]] their sacks, [[H8242]] there [[H2009]] in each man’s [[H376]] sack [[H8242]] was his bag [[H6872]] of silver! [[H3701]] And when they [[H1992]] and their father [[H1]] saw [[H7200]] the bags [[H6872]] of money, [[H3701]] they were dismayed. [[H3372]] 
36 Their father [[H1]] Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “You have deprived me of my sons. [[H7921]] Joseph [[H3130]] is gone [[H369]] and Simeon [[H8095]] is no more. [[H369]] Now you want to take [[H3947]] Benjamin. [[H1144]] Everything [[H3605]] is happening [[H1961]] against me!” [[H5921]] 
37 Then Reuben [[H7205]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] “You may kill [[H4191]] my two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] if [[H518]] I fail [[H3808]] to bring him back [[H935]] to you. [[H413]] Put [[H5414]] him in [[H5921]] my care, [[H3027]] and I [[H589]] will return him.” [[H7725]] 
38 But Jacob replied, [[H559]] “My son [[H1121]] will not [[H3808]] go down there [[H3381]] with you, [[H5973]] for [[H3588]] his brother [[H251]] is dead, [[H4191]] and he [[H1931]] alone [[H905]] is left. [[H7604]] If any harm comes [[H7122]] to him on your [[H834]] journey, [[H1870]] you will bring my gray hairs [[H7872]] down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] in sorrow.” [[H3015]]
