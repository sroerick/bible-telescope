# Genesis 12
[[Genesis 11|←]] • [[Genesis 13|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] “Leave [[H1980]] your country, [[H776]] your kindred, [[H4138]] and your father’s [[H1]] household, [[H1004]] and go to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] I will show you. [[H7200]] 
2 I will make [[H6213]] you into a great [[H1419]] nation, [[H1471]] and I will bless you; [[H1288]] I will make your name [[H8034]] great, [[H1431]] so that you will be [[H1961]] a blessing. [[H1293]] 
3 I will bless [[H1288]] those who bless you [[H1288]] and curse [[H779]] those who curse you; [[H7043]] and all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the earth [[H127]] will be blessed [[H1288]] through you.”  
4 So Abram [[H87]] departed, [[H1980]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had directed him, [[H1696]] and Lot [[H3876]] went [[H1980]] with him. [[H854]] Abram [[H87]] was seventy-five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he left [[H3318]] Haran. [[H2771]] 
5 And Abram [[H87]] took [[H3947]] his wife [[H802]] Sarai, [[H8297]] his nephew [[H1121]] Lot, [[H3876]] and all [[H3605]] the possessions [[H7399]] and people [[H5315]] they had acquired [[H6213]] in Haran, [[H2771]] and set out [[H3318]] for the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]] When they came [[H935]] to the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] 
6 Abram [[H87]] traveled [[H5674]] through the land [[H776]] to [[H5704]] the site [[H4725]] of [[H5704]] the oak [[H436]] of Moreh [[H4176]] at Shechem. [[H7927]] And at that time [[H227]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] were in the land. [[H776]] 
7 Then the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Abram [[H87]] and said, [[H559]] “I will give [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to your offspring.” [[H2233]] So [Abram] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] there [[H8033]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] who had appeared [[H7200]] to him. [[H413]] 
8 From there [[H8033]] [Abram] moved on [[H6275]] to the hill country [[H2022]] east [[H6924]] of  Bethel [[H1008]] and pitched [[H5186]] his tent, [[H168]] with Bethel [[H1008]] to the west [[H3220]] and Ai [[H5857]] to the east. [[H6924]] There [[H8033]] he built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and he called [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
9 And Abram [[H87]] journeyed on [[H5265]] toward [[H5265]] the Negev. [[H5045]] 
10 Now there was [[H1961]] a famine [[H7458]] in the land. [[H776]] So Abram [[H87]] went down [[H3381]] to Egypt [[H4714]] to live there [[H8033]] for a while [[H1481]] because [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] was severe. [[H3515]] 
11 As [[H834]] he was about [[H7126]] to enter [[H935]] Egypt, [[H4714]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his wife [[H802]] Sarai, [[H8297]] “Look, [[H2009]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] [are] a beautiful [[H3303]] woman, [[H802]] 
12 and [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] see you, [[H7200]] they will say, [[H559]] ‘This [[H2063]] is his wife.’ [[H802]] Then they will kill [[H2026]] me [[H853]] but [[H853]] will allow you to live. [[H2421]] 
13 Please [[H4994]] say that [[H559]] you are [[H859]] my sister, [[H269]] so that [[H4616]] I will be treated well [[H3190]] for your sake, [[H5668]] and on account of you [[H1558]] my life [[H5315]] will be spared.” [[H2421]] 
14 So [[H1961]] when Abram [[H87]] entered [[H935]] Egypt, [[H4714]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the woman [[H802]] was very [[H3966]] beautiful. [[H3303]] 
15 When Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] officials [[H8269]] saw [[H7200]] [Sarai], [[H853]] they commended [[H1984]] her to [[H413]] [him], [[H6547]] and she [[H802]] was taken [[H3947]] into the palace [[H1004]] of Pharaoh. [[H6547]] 
16 He treated Abram [[H87]] well [[H3190]] on her account, [[H5668]] and Abram acquired [[H1961]] sheep [[H6629]] and cattle, [[H1241]] male and female donkeys, [[H2543]] menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H8198]] and camels. [[H1581]] 
17 The LORD, however, [[H3068]] afflicted [[H5060]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and his household [[H1004]] with severe [[H1419]] plagues [[H5061]] because of [[H5921]] Abram’s [[H87]] wife [[H802]] Sarai. [[H8297]] 
18 So Pharaoh [[H6547]] summoned [[H7121]] Abram [[H87]] and asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] have you done to me? [[H6213]] Why [[H4100]] did you not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] me she [[H1931]] was your wife? [[H802]] 
19 Why [[H4100]] did you say, [[H559]] ‘She is [[H1931]] my sister,’ [[H269]] so that I took [[H3947]] her as my wife? [[H802]] Now then, [[H6258]] here [[H2009]] is your wife. [[H802]] Take [[H3947]] her and go!” [[H1980]] 
20 Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] gave his men [[H376]] orders [[H6680]] concerning [Abram], [[H5921]] and they sent him away [[H7971]] with his wife [[H802]] and all his possessions. [[H3605]]
