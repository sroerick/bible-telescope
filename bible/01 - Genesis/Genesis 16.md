# Genesis 16
[[Genesis 15|←]] • [[Genesis 17|→]]
1 Now Abram’s [[H87]] wife [[H802]] Sarai [[H8297]] had not [[H3808]] borne a child [[H3205]] to him,  but  she had an Egyptian [[H4713]] maidservant [[H8198]] named [[H8034]] Hagar. [[H1904]] 
2 So Sarai [[H8297]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] “Look [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] the LORD [[H3068]] has prevented me [[H6113]] from bearing children. [[H3205]] Please [[H4994]] go [[H935]] to [[H413]] my maidservant; [[H8198]] perhaps [[H194]] I can build a family [[H1129]] by her.” [[H4480]] Abram [[H87]] listened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of Sarai. [[H8297]] 
3 So after [[H7093]] [he] [[H87]] had lived [[H3427]] in Canaan [[H3667]] for ten [[H6235]] years, [[H8141]] [his] [[H87]] wife [[H802]] Sarai [[H8297]] took [[H3947]] her Egyptian [[H4713]] maidservant [[H8198]] Hagar [[H1904]] and gave [[H5414]] her [[H853]] to Abram [[H87]] to be his wife. [[H802]] 
4 And he slept with [[H935]] Hagar, [[H1904]] and she conceived. [[H2029]] But when [Hagar] realized [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she was pregnant, [[H2029]] she began to despise [[H7043]] her mistress. [[H1404]] 
5 Then Sarai [[H8297]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] “May the wrong done to me [[H2555]] [be] upon you! [[H5921]] I [[H595]] delivered [[H5414]] my servant [[H8198]] into your arms, [[H2436]] and ever since she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she was pregnant, [[H2029]] she has treated me with contempt. [[H7043]] May the LORD [[H3068]] judge [[H8199]] between you and me.” [[H996]] 
6 “Here,” [[H2009]] said [[H559]] Abram, [[H87]] “your servant [[H8198]] is in your hands. [[H3027]] Do [[H6213]] whatever you want [[H2896]] with her.” [[H5869]] Then Sarai [[H8297]] treated [[H6031]] [Hagar] so harshly that she fled [[H1272]] from her. [[H6440]] 
7 Now the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] found [[H4672]] [Hagar] by [[H5921]] a spring [[H5869]] of water [[H4325]] in the desert— [[H4057]] the spring [[H5869]] along the road [[H1870]] to Shur. [[H7793]] 
8 “Hagar, [[H1904]] servant [[H8198]] of Sarai,” [[H8297]] He said, [[H559]] “where [[H335]] have you come from, [[H935]] and where [[H575]] are you going?” [[H1980]] “I am [[H595]] running away [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] my mistress [[H1404]] Sarai,” [[H8297]] she replied. [[H559]] 
9 So the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] told [[H559]] her,  “Return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] your mistress [[H1404]] and submit [[H6031]] to her authority.” [[H8478]] 
10 Then the Angel [[H4397]] added, [[H559]] “I will greatly multiply [[H7235]] your offspring [[H2233]] so that [[H3808]] they will be too numerous [[H7230]] to count.” [[H5608]] 
11 The Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] proceeded: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2009]] you have conceived [[H2030]] and will bear [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] And you shall name [[H7121]] him Ishmael, [[H3458]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has heard [[H8085]] your cry of affliction. [[H6040]] 
12 He [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] a wild donkey [[H6501]] [of a] man, [[H120]] and his hand [[H3027]] will be against everyone, [[H3605]] and everyone’s [[H3605]] hand against him; [[H3027]] he will live [[H7931]] in hostility [[H5921]] toward [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] his brothers.” [[H251]] 
13 So [Hagar] gave [[H7121]] this name [[H8034]] to the LORD [[H3068]] who had spoken [[H1696]] to her: [[H413]] “You are [[H859]] the God [[H410]] who sees me,” [[H7210]] for [[H3588]] she said, [[H559]] “Here [[H1988]] I have [[H1571]] seen [[H7200]] the One who sees me!” [[H7200]] 
14 Therefore [[H5921]] the well [[H875]] was called [[H7121]] Beer-lahai-roi. [[H883]] It is located [[H2009]] between [[H996]] Kadesh [[H6946]] and Bered. [[H1260]] 
15 And Hagar [[H1904]] bore [[H3205]] Abram [[H87]] a son, [[H1121]] and Abram [[H87]] gave [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] Ishmael [[H3458]] to the son [[H1121]] [she] [[H1904]] had borne. [[H3205]] 
16 Abram [[H87]] was eighty-six [[H8084]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when Hagar [[H1904]] bore [[H3205]] Ishmael [[H3458]] to him. [[H87]]
