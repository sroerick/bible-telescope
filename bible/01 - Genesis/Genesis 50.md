# Genesis 50
[[Genesis 49|←]] • [[Exodus 1|→]]
1 Then Joseph [[H3130]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] his father’s [[H1]] face, [[H6440]] wept [[H1058]] over him, [[H5921]] and kissed him. [[H5401]] 
2 And Joseph [[H3130]] directed [[H6680]] the physicians [[H7495]] in his service [[H5650]] to embalm [[H2590]] his father [[H1]] Israel. [[H3478]] So they [[H7495]] embalmed him, [[H2590]] 
3 taking the forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] required to complete [[H4390]] the embalming. [[H2590]] And the Egyptians [[H4713]] mourned [[H1058]] for him seventy [[H7657]] days. [[H3117]] 
4 When the days [[H3117]] of mourning [[H1068]] had passed, [[H5674]] Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] court, [[H1004]] “If [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] please [[H4994]] tell [[H1696]] Pharaoh that [[H6547]] 
5 my father [[H1]] made me swear an oath [[H7650]] when he said, [[H559]] ‘I [[H595]] am about to die. [[H4191]] You must bury me [[H6912]] in the tomb [[H6913]] that [[H834]] I dug [[H3738]] for myself in the land [[H776]] of Canaan.’ [[H3667]] Now [[H6258]] let me go [[H5927]] and bury [[H6912]] my father, [[H1]] and then return.” [[H7725]] 
6 Pharaoh [[H6547]] replied, [[H559]] “Go up [[H5927]] and bury [[H6912]] your father, [[H1]] as [[H834]] he made you swear [to do].” [[H7650]] 
7 Then Joseph [[H3130]] went [[H5927]] to bury [[H6912]] his father, [[H1]] and all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5650]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] accompanied [[H5927]] him— [[H854]] the elders [[H2205]] of Pharaoh’s household [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] 
8 along with all [[H3605]] of Joseph’s [[H3130]] household, [[H1004]] and his brothers, [[H251]] and his father’s [[H1]] household. [[H1004]] Only [[H7535]] their children [[H2945]] and flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] were left [[H5800]] in Goshen. [[H1657]] 
9 Both [[H1571]] chariots [[H7393]] and [[H1571]] horsemen [[H6571]] went up [[H5927]] with him, [[H5973]] and it was [[H1961]] an exceedingly [[H3966]] large [[H3515]] procession. [[H4264]] 
10 When they reached [[H935]] the threshing floor [[H1637]] of Atad, [[H329]] which [[H834]] is across [[H5676]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] they lamented [[H5594]] and wailed [[H4553]] loudly, [[H1419]] and Joseph mourned [[H6213]] for his father [[H1]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
11 When the Canaanites [[H3669]] of the land [[H776]] saw [[H7200]] the mourning [[H60]] at the threshing floor of Atad, [[H329]] they said, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] is a solemn [[H3515]] ceremony of mourning [[H60]] by the Egyptians.” [[H4713]] Thus [[H5921]] the place [[H834]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] is called [[H7121]] Abel-mizraim. [[H67]] 
12 So Jacob’s sons [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] he had charged them. [[H6680]] 
13 They [[H1121]] carried [[H5375]] him to the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] and buried [[H6912]] him in the cave [[H4631]] at Machpelah [[H4375]] in the field [[H7704]] near [[H5921]] Mamre, [[H4471]] which [[H834]] Abraham [[H85]] had purchased [[H7069]] from Ephron [[H6085]] the Hittite [[H2850]] as a burial [[H6913]] site. [[H272]] 
14 After [[H310]] Joseph [[H3130]] had buried [[H6912]] his father, [[H1]] he returned [[H7725]] to Egypt [[H4714]] with his brothers [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] who had gone [[H5927]] with him [[H854]] to bury his father. [[H1]] 
15 When Joseph’s [[H3130]] brothers [[H251]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] their father [[H1]] was dead, [[H4191]] they said, [[H559]] “What if [[H3863]] Joseph [[H3130]] bears a grudge? [[H7852]] Then he will surely repay [[H7725]] us for all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] we did [[H1580]] to him.” [[H853]] 
16 So they sent word [[H6680]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] saying, [[H559]] “Before [[H6440]] he died, [[H4194]] your father [[H1]] commanded, [[H6680]] 
17 ‘This is what [[H3541]] you are to say [[H559]] to Joseph: [[H3130]] I beg you, [[H577]] please [[H4994]] forgive [[H5375]] the transgression [[H6588]] and sin [[H2403]] of your brothers, [[H251]] for [[H3588]] they did [[H1580]] you wrong.’ [[H7451]] So now, [Joseph], [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] forgive [[H5375]] the transgression [[H6588]] of the servants [[H5650]] of the God [[H430]] of your father.” [[H1]] When their message [[H1696]] came to him, [[H413]] Joseph [[H3130]] wept. [[H1058]] 
18 His brothers [[H251]] also [[H1571]] came to him, [[H1980]] bowed down [[H5307]] before him, [[H6440]] and said, [[H559]] “We are your slaves!” [[H5650]] 
19 But Joseph [[H3130]] replied, [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid. [[H3372]] Am I [[H589]] in the place of [[H8478]] God? [[H430]] 
20 As for you, [[H859]] what you intended [[H2803]] against me [[H5921]] for evil, [[H7451]] God [[H430]] intended [[H2803]] for good, [[H2896]] in order to [[H4616]] accomplish [[H6213]] a day [[H3117]] like this— [[H2088]] to preserve the lives [[H2421]] of many [[H7227]] people. [[H5971]] 
21 Therefore [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] be afraid. [[H3372]] I [[H595]] will provide for [[H3557]] you [[H853]] and your little ones.” [[H2945]] So [Joseph] reassured [[H5162]] [his brothers] [[H853]] and spoke [[H1696]] kindly to them. [[H5921]] 
22 Now Joseph [[H3130]] and his father’s [[H1]] household [[H1004]] remained [[H3427]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and Joseph [[H3130]] lived [[H2421]] to the age [[H8141]] of 110. [[H3967]] 
23 He [[H3130]] saw [[H7200]] Ephraim’s [[H669]] sons [[H1121]] to the third generation, [[H8029]] and indeed [[H1571]] the sons [[H1121]] of Machir [[H4353]] son [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] were brought up [[H3205]] on [[H5921]] Joseph’s [[H3130]] knees. [[H1290]] 
24 Then Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his brothers, [[H251]] “I [[H595]] am about to die, [[H4191]] but God [[H430]] will surely [[H6485]] visit [[H6485]] you [[H853]] and bring you up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] He promised on oath [[H7650]] to Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob.” [[H3290]] 
25 And Joseph [[H3130]] made the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] take an oath [[H7650]] and said, [[H559]] “God [[H430]] will surely [[H6485]] visit [[H6485]] you, [[H853]] and then you must carry [[H5927]] my bones [[H6106]] up from this place.” [[H2088]] 
26 So Joseph [[H3130]] died [[H4191]] at the age [[H1121]] of 110. [[H3967]] And they embalmed [[H2590]] [his body] [[H853]] and placed it [[H3455]] in a coffin [[H727]] in Egypt. [[H4714]]
