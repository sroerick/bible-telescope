# Genesis 39
[[Genesis 38|←]] • [[Genesis 40|→]]
1 Meanwhile, Joseph [[H3130]] had been taken down [[H3381]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] where an Egyptian [[H4713]] named Potiphar, [[H6318]] an officer [[H5631]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] and captain [[H8269]] of the guard, [[H2876]] bought [[H7069]] him from [[H3027]] the Ishmaelites [[H3459]] who [[H834]] had taken [[H3381]] him there. [[H8033]] 
2 And the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Joseph, [[H3130]] and he became [[H1961]] a successful [[H6743]] man, [[H582]] serving [[H1961]] in the household [[H1004]] of his Egyptian [[H4713]] master. [[H113]] 
3 When his master [[H113]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] [was] with him [[H854]] [and] [[H3068]] made him prosper [[H6743]] in all [[H3605]] he [[H1931]] did, [[H6213]] 
4 Joseph [[H3130]] found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in his sight [[H5869]] and became his personal attendant. [[H8334]] Potiphar put [[H6485]] him in charge of [[H5921]] his household [[H1004]] and entrusted [[H5414]] him [[H3027]] with everything [[H3605]] he owned. [[H3426]] 
5 From the time [[H227]] that he put [Joseph] in charge [[H6485]] of his household [[H1004]] and [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] he owned, [[H3426]] the LORD [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] the Egyptian’s [[H4713]] household [[H1004]] on account of [[H1558]] [him]. [[H3130]] The LORD’s [[H3068]] blessing [[H1293]] was [[H1961]] on everything [[H3605]] he owned, [[H3426]] both in his house [[H1004]] and in his field. [[H7704]] 
6 So [Potiphar] left [[H5800]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he owned  in Joseph’s [[H3130]] care; [[H3027]] he did not [[H3808]] concern [[H3045]] himself with anything [[H3972]] except [[H3588]] the food [[H3899]] he [[H1931]] ate. [[H398]] Now Joseph [[H3130]] was [[H1961]] well-built [[H3303]] and handsome, [[H3303]] 
7 and [[H1961]] after some time [[H310]] his master’s [[H113]] wife [[H802]] cast [[H5375]] her eyes [[H5869]] on [[H413]] Joseph [[H3130]] and said, [[H559]] “Sleep [[H7901]] with me.” [[H5973]] 
8 But he refused. [[H3985]] “Look,” [[H2005]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his master’s [[H113]] wife, [[H802]] “with me here, [[H854]] my master [[H113]] does not [[H3808]] concern himself [[H3045]] with anything [[H4100]] in his house, [[H1004]] and he has entrusted [[H5414]] everything [[H3605]] he owns [[H3426]] to  my care. [[H3027]] 
9 No [[H369]] one in this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] is greater [[H1419]] than I am. [[H4480]] He has withheld [[H2820]] nothing [[H3808]] from [[H4480]] me except [[H3588]] you, [[H518]] because [[H834]] you [[H859]] are his wife. [[H802]] So how [[H349]] could I do [[H6213]] such [[H2063]] a great [[H1419]] evil [[H7451]] and sin [[H2398]] against God?” [[H430]] 
10 Although [[H1961]] [Potiphar’s wife] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Joseph [[H3130]] day [[H3117]] after day, [[H3117]] he refused [[H3808]] to go to bed [[H7901]] with her [[H681]] [or] be [[H1961]] with her. [[H5973]] 
11 One day, [[H3117]] however, [[H1961]] [Joseph] went [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] to attend to [[H6213]] his work, [[H4399]] and not [[H369]] a single [[H376]] household [[H1004]] servant [[H376]] [was] [[H8033]] inside. [[H1004]] 
12 She grabbed [Joseph] [[H8610]] by his cloak [[H899]] and said, [[H559]] “Sleep [[H7901]] with me!” [[H5973]] But leaving [[H5800]] his garment [[H899]] in her hand, [[H3027]] he escaped [[H5127]] and ran [[H3318]] outside. [[H2351]] 
13 When she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he had left [[H5800]] his cloak [[H899]] in her hand [[H3027]] and had run [[H5127]] out [of the house], [[H2351]] 
14 she called [[H7121]] her household [[H1004]] servants. [[H376]] “Look,” [[H7200]] she said, [[H559]] “this Hebrew [[H5680]] has been brought [[H935]] to us  to make sport [[H6711]] of us.  He came [[H935]] to me [[H413]] so he could sleep [[H7901]] with me, [[H5973]] but I screamed [[H7121]] as loud [[H6963]] as I could. [[H1419]] 
15 When he heard [[H8085]] me scream for help, [[H7311]] he left [[H5800]] his cloak [[H899]] beside me [[H681]] and ran [[H5127]] out [of the house].” [[H2351]] 
16 So [Potiphar’s wife] kept [[H3240]] Joseph’s garment [[H899]] beside her [[H681]] until [[H5704]] his master [[H113]] came [[H935]] home. [[H1004]] 
17 Then she told [[H1696]] him the same [[H428]] story: [[H1697]] “The Hebrew [[H5680]] slave [[H5650]] you brought [[H935]] us [[H413]] came [[H935]] to me  to make sport [[H6711]] of me,  
18 but when I screamed for help, [[H7311]] he left [[H5800]] his cloak [[H899]] beside me [[H681]] and ran [[H5127]] out [of the house].” [[H2351]] 
19 When [[H1961]] his master [[H113]] heard [[H8085]] the story [[H1697]] his wife [[H802]] told [[H1696]] him, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] “This [[H428]] is what [[H1697]] your slave [[H5650]] did [[H6213]] to me,”  he burned [[H2734]] with anger. [[H639]] 
20 So Joseph’s [[H3130]] master [[H113]] took [[H3947]] him [[H853]] and had him thrown [[H5414]] into [[H413]] the prison [[H1004]] where [[H4725]] the king’s [[H4428]] prisoners [[H631]] were confined. [[H631]] While [Joseph] was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] in the prison, [[H1004]] 
21 the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] [him] [[H3130]] and extended [[H5186]] kindness [[H2617]] to him. [[H413]] He granted [[H5414]] him favor [[H2580]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the prison [[H1004]] warden, [[H8269]] 
22 [who] [[H8269]] put [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] those held [[H615]] in the prison [[H1004]] under Joseph’s [[H3130]] authority, [[H3027]] so that he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] responsible [[H6213]] for all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was done [[H6213]] there. [[H8033]] 
23 The warden [[H8269]] did not [[H369]] concern himself [[H7200]] with anything [[H3605]] under Joseph’s authority, [[H3027]] because [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] was with him [[H854]] and gave him success [[H6743]] in whatever [[H834]] he [[H1931]] did. [[H6213]]
