[[Genesis 33|←]] • [[Genesis 35|→]]
1 Now Dinah, [[H1783]] the daughter [[H1323]] Leah [[H3812]] had borne [[H3205]] to Jacob, [[H3290]] went out [[H3318]] to visit [[H7200]] the daughters [[H1323]] of the land. [[H776]] 
2 When Shechem [[H7927]] son [[H1121]] of Hamor [[H2544]] the Hivite, [[H2340]] the prince [[H5387]] of the region, [[H776]] saw her, [[H7200]] he took [[H3947]] her [[H853]] and lay [[H7901]] with her [[H854]] by force. [[H6031]] 
3 And his soul [[H5315]] was drawn [[H1692]] to Dinah, [[H1783]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] He loved [[H157]] the young girl [[H5291]] and spoke to her tenderly. [[H1696]] 
4 So Shechem [[H7927]] told [[H559]] his father [[H1]] Hamor, [[H2544]] “Get [[H3947]] me this [[H2063]] girl [[H3207]] as a wife.” [[H802]] 
5 Jacob [[H3290]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Shechem had defiled [[H2930]] his daughter [[H1323]] Dinah, [[H1783]] but since his sons [[H1121]] were [[H1961]] with [[H854]] his livestock [[H4735]] in the field, [[H7704]] he [[H3290]] held his peace [[H2790]] until [[H5704]] they returned. [[H935]] 
6 Meanwhile, Shechem’s [[H7927]] father [[H1]] Hamor [[H2544]] came [[H3318]] to speak [[H1696]] with [[H854]] Jacob. [[H3290]] 
7 When Jacob’s [[H3290]] sons [[H1121]] heard what had happened, [[H8085]] they returned [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the field. [[H7704]] They were filled with [[H3966]] grief [[H6087]] and fury, [[H2734]] because [[H3588]] Shechem had committed [[H6213]] an outrage [[H5039]] in Israel [[H3478]] by lying [[H7901]] with [[H854]] Jacob’s [[H3290]] daughter— [[H1323]] a thing [[H3651]] that should not [[H3808]] be done. [[H6213]] 
8 But Hamor [[H2544]] said [[H1696]] to them, [[H854]] “My son [[H1121]] Shechem [[H7927]] longs for [[H2836]] your daughter. [[H1323]] Please [[H4994]] give [[H5414]] her [[H853]] to him  as his wife. [[H802]] 
9 Intermarry with us; [[H2859]] give [[H5414]] us  your daughters, [[H1323]] and take [[H3947]] our daughters [[H1323]] for yourselves.  
10 You may settle [[H3427]] among us, [[H854]] and the land [[H776]] {will} be [[H1961]] open to you. [[H6440]] Live here, [[H3427]] move about freely, [[H5503]] and acquire your own property.” [[H270]] 
11 Then Shechem [[H7927]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Dinah’s father [[H1]] and brothers, [[H251]] “Grant me this favor, [[H4672]] and I will give [[H5414]] you whatever [[H834]] you ask. [[H559]] 
12 Demand [[H7235]] a high [[H5921]] dowry [[H4119]] and [an expensive] gift, [[H4976]] and I will give you [[H5414]] whatever [[H834]] you ask. [[H559]] Only give [[H5414]] me  the girl [[H5291]] as my wife!” [[H802]] 
13 But because [[H834]] [Shechem] had defiled [[H2930]] their sister [[H269]] Dinah, [[H1783]] Jacob’s [[H3290]] sons [[H1121]] answered [[H6030]] [him] [[H7927]] and his father [[H1]] Hamor [[H2544]] deceitfully. [[H4820]] 
14 “We cannot [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] such [[H2088]] a thing,” [[H1697]] they said. [[H559]] “To give [[H5414]] our sister [[H269]] to  an uncircumcised man [[H6190]] would be a disgrace [[H2781]] to us.  
15 We will consent [[H225]] to this  on one [[H389]] condition, [[H518]] that you become [[H1961]] circumcised [[H4135]] like us— [[H3644]] every one of [[H3605]] your males. [[H2145]] 
16 Then we will give [[H5414]] you  our daughters [[H1323]] and [[H853]] take [[H3947]] your daughters [[H1323]] for ourselves.  We will dwell [[H3427]] among you [[H854]] and become [[H1961]] one [[H259]] people. [[H5971]] 
17 But if [[H518]] you will not [[H3808]] agree [[H8085]] to be circumcised, [[H4135]] then we will take [[H3947]] our sister [[H1323]] and go.” [[H1980]] 
18 Their offer [[H1697]] seemed good [[H3190]] to Hamor [[H2544]] and his [[H2544]] son [[H1121]] Shechem. [[H7927]] 
19 The young man, [[H5288]] who [was] [[H1931]] the most respected [[H3513]] of all [[H3605]] his father’s [[H1]] household, [[H1004]] did not [[H3808]] hesitate [[H309]] to fulfill [[H6213]] this request, [[H1697]] because [[H3588]] he was delighted [[H2654]] with Jacob’s [[H3290]] daughter. [[H1323]] 
20 So Hamor [[H2544]] and his son [[H1121]] Shechem [[H7927]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] of their city [[H5892]] and addressed [[H1696]] the men [[H582]] of their city: [[H5892]] 
21 “These [[H428]] men [[H376]] are at peace [[H8003]] with us. [[H854]] Let them live [[H3427]] and trade [[H5503]] in our land; [[H776]] indeed, [[H2009]] [it] [[H776]] is large [[H7342]] enough for them. [[H6440]] Let us take [[H3947]] their daughters [[H1323]] in marriage [[H802]] and give [[H5414]] our daughters to them. [[H1323]] 
22 But only [[H389]] on this condition [[H2063]] {will} the men [[H376]] agree [[H225]] to dwell [[H3427]] with us [[H854]] and be [[H1961]] one [[H259]] people: [[H5971]] if all [[H3605]] our men [[H2145]] are circumcised [[H4135]] as [[H834]] they are. [[H1992]] 
23 Will not [[H3808]] their livestock, [[H4735]] their possessions, [[H7075]] and all [[H3605]] their [[H1992]] animals [become ours]? [[H929]] Only [[H389]] let us consent [[H225]] to them,  and they will dwell [[H3427]] among us.” [[H854]] 
24 All the men [[H3605]] who went out [[H3318]] of the city [[H5892]] gate [[H8179]] listened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Hamor [[H2544]] and his son [[H1121]] Shechem, [[H7927]] and every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] of the city [[H5892]] was circumcised. [[H4135]] 
25 Three [[H7992]] days later, [[H3117]] while [[H1961]] they were [[H1961]] still in pain, [[H3510]] two [[H8147]] of Jacob’s [[H3290]] sons [[H1121]] (Dinah’s [[H1783]] brothers [[H251]] Simeon [[H8095]] and Levi) [[H3878]] took [[H3947]] their swords, [[H2719]] went [[H935]] into [[H5921]] the unsuspecting [[H983]] city, [[H5892]] and slaughtered [[H2026]] every [[H3605]] male. [[H2145]] 
26 They killed [[H2026]] Hamor [[H2544]] and his son [[H1121]] Shechem [[H7927]] with their swords, [[H2719]] took [[H3947]] Dinah [[H1783]] out of Shechem’s [[H7927]] house, [[H1004]] and went away. [[H3318]] 
27 Jacob’s [[H3290]] other sons [[H1121]] came [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] the slaughter [[H2491]] and looted [[H962]] the city, [[H5892]] because [[H834]] their sister [[H269]] had been defiled. [[H2930]] 
28 They took [[H3947]] their flocks [[H6629]] and [[H853]] herds [[H1241]] and [[H853]] donkeys, [[H2543]] and everything else [[H834]] in the city [[H5892]] or in the field. [[H7704]] 
29 They carried off [[H7617]] all [[H3605]] their possessions [[H2428]] and [[H853]] women [[H802]] and [[H853]] children, [[H2945]] and they plundered [[H962]] everything [[H3605]] in [their] houses. [[H1004]] 
30 Then Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Simeon [[H8095]] and Levi, [[H3878]] “You have brought trouble [[H5916]] upon me [[H853]] by making me repugnant [[H887]] to the Canaanites [[H3669]] and Perizzites, [[H6522]] the people [[H3427]] of this land. [[H776]] We [[H589]] are few [[H4962]] in number; [[H4557]] if they unite [[H622]] against me [[H5921]] and attack me, [[H5221]] I [[H589]] and my household [[H1004]] will be destroyed. [[H8045]] 
31 But [Simeon and Levi] answered, [[H559]] “Should he have treated [[H6213]] our sister [[H269]] like a prostitute?” [[H2181]]
