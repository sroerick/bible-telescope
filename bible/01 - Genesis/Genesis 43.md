# Genesis 43
[[Genesis 42|←]] • [[Genesis 44|→]]
1 Now the famine [[H7458]] was still severe [[H3515]] in the land. [[H776]] 
2 So when [[H834]] [Jacob’s sons] had eaten all [[H3615]] the grain [[H7668]] they had brought [[H935]] from Egypt, [[H4714]] their father [[H1]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Go back [[H7725]] and buy [[H7666]] a little more [[H4592]] food [[H400]] for us.”  
3 But Judah [[H3063]] replied, [[H559]] “The man [[H376]] solemnly warned [[H5749]] us,  ‘You will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my face [[H6440]] again unless [[H1115]] your brother [[H251]] is with you.’ [[H854]] 
4 If [[H518]] you will send [[H7971]] our brother [[H251]] with us, [[H854]] we will go down [[H3381]] and buy [[H7666]] food [[H400]] for you.  
5 But if [[H518]] you will not [[H369]] send him, [[H7971]] we will not [[H3808]] go; [[H3381]] for [[H3588]] the man [[H376]] told [[H559]] us, [[H413]] ‘You will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my face [[H6440]] again unless [[H1115]] your brother [[H251]] is with you.’” [[H854]] 
6 “Why [[H4100]] did you bring this trouble [[H7489]] upon me?”  Israel [[H3478]] asked. [[H559]] “Why did you tell [[H5046]] the man [[H376]] you had another [[H5750]] brother?” [[H251]] 
7 They replied, [[H559]] “The man [[H376]] questioned [[H7592]] us  in detail [[H7592]] about ourselves and our family: [[H4138]] ‘Is your father [[H1]] still [[H5750]] alive? [[H2416]] Do you have [[H3426]] another brother?’ [[H251]] And we answered [[H5046]] him  accordingly. [[H5921]] How could we possibly know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] he would say, [[H559]] ‘Bring [[H3381]] your brother here’?” [[H251]] 
8 And Judah [[H3063]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] Israel, [[H3478]] “Send [[H7971]] the boy [[H5288]] with me, [[H854]] and we will go at once, [[H1980]] so that we may live [[H2421]] and not [[H3808]] die— [[H4191]] neither we, [[H587]] nor you, [[H859]] nor our children. [[H2945]] 
9 I [[H595]] will guarantee his safety. [[H6148]] You may hold me [[H1245]] personally responsible! [[H3027]] If [[H518]] I do not [[H3808]] bring him back [[H935]] and set [[H3322]] him before you, [[H6440]] then let me  bear the guilt before you [[H2398]] all my life. [[H3605]] 
10 If we had not [[H3588]] delayed, [[H4102]] we could have come and gone [[H7725]] twice [[H6471]] by now.” [[H6258]] 
11 Then their father [[H1]] Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “If [[H518]] it must be so, [[H3651]] then [[H645]] do [[H6213]] this: [[H2063]] Put [[H3947]] some of the best products [[H2173]] of the land [[H776]] in your packs [[H3627]] and carry them down [[H3381]] as a gift [[H4503]] for the man— [[H582]] a little [[H4592]] balm [[H6875]] and a little [[H4592]] honey, [[H1706]] spices [[H5219]] and myrrh, [[H3910]] pistachios [[H992]] and almonds. [[H8247]] 
12 Take [[H3947]] double [[H4932]] the money [[H3701]] with you [[H3027]] so that [[H853]] you may return [[H7725]] the money [[H3701]] that was put back into [[H7725]] in the mouths [[H6310]] of your sacks. [[H572]] Perhaps [[H194]] it [[H1931]] was a mistake. [[H4870]] 
13 Take [[H3947]] your brother also, [[H251]] and return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] at once. [[H6965]] 
14 May God [[H410]] Almighty [[H7706]] grant [[H5414]] you  mercy [[H7356]] before [[H6440]] the man [[H376]] so that he will release [[H7971]] your other [[H312]] brother [[H251]] along with Benjamin. [[H1144]] As for me, [[H589]] if [[H834]] I am bereaved, [[H7921]] I am bereaved.” [[H7921]] 
15 So the men [[H376]] took [[H3947]] these [[H2063]] gifts, [[H4503]] along with double [[H4932]] the amount of money, [[H3701]] and [[H853]] Benjamin as well. [[H1144]] They made their way down [[H3381]] to Egypt [[H4714]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Joseph. [[H3130]] 
16 When Joseph [[H3130]] saw [[H7200]] Benjamin [[H1144]] with [his brothers], [[H854]] he said [[H559]] to the steward [[H834]] of [[H5921]] his house, [[H1004]] “Take [[H935]] these men [[H582]] to my house. [[H1004]] Slaughter [[H2873]] an animal [[H2874]] and prepare it, [[H3559]] for [[H3588]] they shall dine [[H398]] with [[H854]] me at noon.” [[H6672]] 
17 The man [[H376]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] had commanded [[H559]] and took [[H935]] [the brothers] [[H376]] to Joseph’s [[H3130]] house. [[H1004]] 
18 But the men [[H376]] were frightened [[H3372]] that [[H3588]] they had been taken [[H935]] to Joseph’s [[H3130]] house. [[H1004]] “We [[H587]] have been brought [[H935]] here because of [[H5921]] the money [[H3701]] that was returned [[H7725]] in our bags [[H572]] the first time,” [[H8462]] they said. [[H559]] “They intend [[H1556]] to overpower [[H5307]] us [[H5921]] and take [[H3947]] us [[H853]] as slaves, [[H5650]] along with [[H853]] our donkeys.” [[H2543]] 
19 So they approached [[H5066]] Joseph’s [[H3130]] steward [[H376]] and spoke [[H1696]] to him [[H413]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the house. [[H1004]] 
20 “Please, [[H994]] sir,” [[H113]] they said, [[H559]] “we really did come down [[H3381]] here the first time [[H8462]] to buy [[H7666]] food. [[H400]] 
21 But [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] we came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the place we stopped for the night, [[H4411]] we opened [[H6605]] our sacks [[H572]] and, behold, [[H2009]] each of us [found] [[H376]] his silver [[H3701]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of his sack! [[H572]] It was the full amount [[H4948]] of our money, [[H3701]] and we have brought it back [[H7725]] with us. [[H3027]] 
22 We have brought [[H3381]] additional [[H312]] money [[H3701]] with [[H3027]] us to buy [[H7666]] food. [[H400]] We do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] who [[H4310]] put [[H7760]] our money [[H3701]] in our sacks.” [[H572]] 
23 “It is fine,” [[H7965]] said the steward. [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid. [[H3372]] Your God, [[H430]] the God [[H430]] of your father, [[H1]] gave [[H5414]] you  the treasure [[H4301]] [that was] in your sacks. [[H572]] I received [[H935]] your money.” [[H3701]] Then he brought Simeon [[H8095]] out [[H3318]] to them. [[H413]] 
24 And the [steward] [[H376]] took [[H935]] the men [[H376]] into Joseph’s [[H3130]] house, [[H1004]] gave [[H5414]] them water [[H4325]] to wash [[H7364]] their feet, [[H7272]] and provided [[H5414]] food [[H4554]] for their donkeys. [[H2543]] 
25 Since [[H3588]] [the brothers] had been told [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] they were going to eat [[H398]] a meal [[H3899]] there, [[H8033]] they prepared [[H3559]] their gift [[H4503]] for [[H5704]] Joseph’s [[H3130]] arrival [[H935]] at noon. [[H6672]] 
26 When Joseph [[H3130]] came [[H935]] home, [[H1004]] they presented [[H935]] him [[H853]] with the gifts [[H4503]] they had brought, [[H3027]] and they bowed [[H7812]] to the ground before him. [[H776]] 
27 He asked [[H7592]] if they were well, [[H7965]] and then he asked, [[H559]] “How is your elderly [[H2205]] father [[H1]] that [[H834]] you told [me about]? [[H559]] Is he still [[H5750]] alive?” [[H2416]] 
28 “Your servant [[H5650]] our father [[H1]] is well,” [[H7965]] they answered. [[H559]] “He is still [[H5750]] alive.” [[H2416]] And they bowed down [[H6915]] to honor him. [[H7812]] 
29 When [Joseph] looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] his brother [[H251]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] his own mother’s [[H517]] son, [[H1121]] he asked, [[H559]] “Is this [[H2088]] your youngest [[H6996]] brother, [[H251]] the one [[H834]] you told me about?” [[H559]] Then he declared, [[H559]] “May God [[H430]] be gracious to you, [[H2603]] my son.” [[H1121]] 
30 Joseph [[H3130]] hurried [[H4116]] out because [[H3588]] he was moved [[H3648]] to tears [[H1245]] for [[H413]] his brother, [[H251]] and he went [[H935]] to a private room [[H2315]] to weep. [[H1058]] 
31 Then he washed [[H7364]] his face [[H6440]] and came back out. [[H3318]] Regaining his composure, [[H662]] he said, [[H559]] “Serve [[H7760]] the meal.” [[H3899]] 
32 They served [[H7760]] [Joseph’s] brothers [[H905]] separately from [[H905]] him [[H905]] and the Egyptians [[H4713]] who ate [[H398]] with him, [[H854]] because [[H3588]] Egyptians [[H4713]] would [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] with Hebrews, [[H5680]] since [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] was detestable [[H8441]] to them. [[H4713]] 
33 They were seated [[H3427]] before him [[H6440]] in order by age, [[H1062]] from the firstborn [[H1060]] to the youngest, [[H6810]] and the men [[H376]] looked at [[H413]] each [[H376]] other [[H7453]] in astonishment. [[H8539]] 
34 When the portions [[H4864]] were served [[H5375]] to them [[H413]] from Joseph’s table, [[H6440]] Benjamin’s [[H1144]] portion [[H4864]] was five [[H2568]] times [[H3027]] larger than [[H7235]] anyone else’s. [[H3605]] So they feasted [[H8354]] and drank freely [[H7937]] with [Joseph]. [[H5973]]
