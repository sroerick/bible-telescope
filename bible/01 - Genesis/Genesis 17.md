# Genesis 17
[[Genesis 16|←]] • [[Genesis 18|→]]
1 When Abram [[H87]] was [[H1961]] ninety-nine [[H8673]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] him [[H87]] and said, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] am God [[H410]] Almighty. [[H7706]] Walk [[H1980]] before Me [[H6440]] and be [[H1961]] blameless. [[H8549]] 
2 I will establish [[H5414]] My covenant [[H1285]] between Me and you, [[H996]] and I will multiply [[H7235]] you [[H853]] exceedingly.” [[H3966]] 
3 Then Abram [[H87]] fell facedown, [[H5307]] and God [[H430]] said [[H1696]] to him, [[H854]] 
4 “As for Me, [[H589]] this is [[H2009]] My covenant [[H1285]] with you: [[H854]] You will be [[H1961]] the father [[H1]] of many [[H1995]] nations. [[H1471]] 
5 No [[H3808]] longer {will} [[H5750]] you be called [[H7121]] Abram, [[H87]] but your name [[H8034]] will be [[H1961]] Abraham, [[H85]] for [[H3588]] I have made [[H5414]] you the father [[H1]] of many [[H1995]] nations. [[H1471]] 
6 I will make you exceedingly [[H3966]] fruitful; [[H6509]] I will make [[H5414]] nations [of you], [[H1471]] and kings [[H4428]] will descend [[H3318]] from you. [[H4480]] 
7 I will establish [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] as an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] between Me and you [[H996]] and your descendants [[H310]] after you, [[H2233]] to be [[H1961]] your God [[H430]] and the God of your descendants [[H2233]] after you. [[H310]] 
8 And to you and your descendants [[H310]] I will give [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of your sojourn— [[H4033]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan— [[H3667]] as an eternal [[H5769]] possession; [[H272]] and I will be [[H1961]] their God.” [[H430]] 
9 God [[H430]] also said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] “As for you, [[H859]] you must keep [[H8104]] My covenant, [[H1285]] you [[H859]] and your descendants [[H2233]] for the generations [[H1755]] to come. [[H310]] 
10 This [[H2063]] is My covenant [[H1285]] with [[H996]] you and your descendants [[H2233]] after you, [[H310]] which [[H834]] you are to keep: [[H8104]] Every [[H3605]] male among you [[H2145]] must be circumcised. [[H4135]] 
11 You are to circumcise [[H5243]] the flesh [[H1320]] of your foreskin, [[H6190]] and this will be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] of the covenant [[H1285]] between Me and you. [[H996]] 
12 Generation after generation, [[H1755]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] must be circumcised [[H4135]] when he is eight [[H8083]] days old, [[H3117]] including those born [[H3211]] in your household [[H1004]] and those purchased [[H4736]] from a [[H3605]] foreigner— [[H5236]] even those [[H1931]] who [[H834]] are not [[H3808]] your offspring. [[H2233]] 
13 Whether they are born [[H3211]] in your household [[H1004]] or purchased, [[H4736]] they must be circumcised. [[H4135]] My covenant [[H1285]] in your flesh [[H1320]] will be [[H1961]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant. [[H1285]] 
14 But if any male [[H2145]] is not [[H3808]] circumcised, [[H4135]] [he] [[H1931]] will be cut off [[H3772]] from his people; [[H5971]] he has broken [[H6565]] My covenant.” [[H1285]] 
15 Then God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] “As for Sarai [[H8297]] your wife, [[H802]] do not [[H3808]] call [[H7121]] her Sarai, [[H8297]] for [[H3588]] her name [is to be] [[H8034]] Sarah. [[H8283]] 
16 And I will bless her [[H1288]] and will surely [[H1571]] give [[H5414]] you  a son [[H1121]] by her. [[H4480]] I will bless her, [[H1288]] and she will be [[H1961]] [the mother] of nations; [[H1471]] kings [[H4428]] of peoples [[H5971]] will descend [[H1961]] from her.” [[H4480]] 
17 Abraham [[H85]] fell facedown. [[H5307]] Then he laughed [[H6711]] and said [[H559]] to himself, [[H3820]] “Can a child be born [[H3205]] to a man who is [[H1121]] a hundred [[H3967]] years old? [[H8141]] Can Sarah [[H8283]] give birth [[H3205]] at the age of ninety?” [[H8673]] 
18 And Abraham [[H85]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] “O that [[H3863]] Ishmael [[H3458]] might live [[H2421]] under Your [blessing]!” [[H6440]] 
19 But God [[H430]] replied, [[H559]] “Your wife [[H802]] Sarah [[H8283]] {will} indeed [[H61]] bear [[H3205]] you a son, [[H1121]] and you are to name [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Isaac. [[H3327]] I will establish [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] him as an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] for his descendants [[H2233]] after him. [[H310]] 
20 As for Ishmael, [[H3458]] I have heard you, [[H8085]] [and] I will surely [[H2009]] bless [[H1288]] him; [[H853]] I will make him fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply him greatly. [[H7235]] He will become the father [[H3205]] of twelve [[H8147]] rulers, [[H5387]] and I will make [[H5414]] him into a great [[H1419]] nation. [[H1471]] 
21 But [[H853]] I will establish [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Isaac, [[H3327]] whom [[H834]] Sarah [[H8283]] will bear [[H3205]] to you  at this [[H2088]] time [[H4150]] next [[H312]] year.” [[H8141]] 
22 When He had finished [[H3615]] talking [[H1696]] with [Abraham], [[H854]] God [[H430]] went up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] [him]. [[H85]] 
23 Then Abraham [[H85]] took [[H3947]] his son [[H1121]] Ishmael [[H3458]] and all [[H3605]] those born [[H3211]] in his household [[H1004]] or purchased [[H4736]] with his money— [[H3701]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] among the members [[H376]] of Abraham’s [[H85]] household— [[H1004]] and he circumcised them [[H4135]] that [[H2088]] very [[H6106]] day, [[H3117]] just as [[H834]] God [[H430]] had told [[H1696]] him. [[H854]] 
24 So Abraham [[H85]] was ninety-nine [[H8673]] years old [[H1121]] when he was circumcised, [[H4135]] 
25 and his son [[H1121]] Ishmael [[H3458]] was thirteen; [[H7969]] 
26 Abraham [[H85]] and his son [[H1121]] Ishmael [[H3458]] were circumcised [[H4135]] on the [[H2088]] same [[H6106]] day. [[H3117]] 
27 And all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of [Abraham’s] household— [[H1004]] both servants born [[H3211]] in his household [[H1004]] and those purchased [[H4736]] from foreigners— [[H1121]] were circumcised with him. [[H4135]]
