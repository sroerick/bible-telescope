[[Genesis 9|←]] • [[Genesis 11|→]]
1 This [[H428]] is the account [[H8435]] of Noah’s [[H5146]] sons [[H1121]] Shem, [[H8035]] Ham, [[H2526]] and Japheth, [[H3315]] who also  had sons [[H1121]] after [[H310]] the flood. [[H3999]] 
2 The sons [[H1121]] of Japheth: [[H3315]] Gomer, [[H1586]] Magog, [[H4031]] Madai, [[H4074]] Javan, [[H3120]] Tubal, [[H8422]] Meshech, [[H4902]] and Tiras. [[H8494]] 
3 The sons [[H1121]] of Gomer: [[H1586]] Ashkenaz, [[H813]] Riphath, [[H7384]] and Togarmah. [[H8425]] 
4 And the sons [[H1121]] of Javan: [[H3120]] Elishah, [[H473]] Tarshish, [[H8659]] Kittim, [[H3794]] and Dodanim. [[H1721]] 
5 From these, [[H428]] the maritime [[H339]] peoples [[H1471]] separated [[H6504]] into their territories, [[H776]] according to their languages, [[H3956]] by clans [[H4940]] within their nations. [[H1471]] 
6 The sons [[H1121]] of Ham: [[H2526]] Cush, [[H3568]] Mizraim, [[H4714]] Put, [[H6316]] and Canaan. [[H3667]] 
7 The sons [[H1121]] of Cush: [[H3568]] Seba, [[H5434]] Havilah, [[H2341]] Sabtah, [[H5454]] Raamah, [[H7484]] and Sabteca. [[H5455]] And the sons [[H1121]] of Raamah: [[H7484]] Sheba [[H7614]] and Dedan. [[H1719]] 
8 And Cush [[H3568]] was the father of [[H3205]] Nimrod, [[H5248]] who [[H1931]] grew [[H2490]] to be [[H1961]] a mighty warrior [[H1368]] on the earth. [[H776]] 
9 He [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] a mighty [[H1368]] hunter [[H6718]] before [[H6440]] the LORD; [[H3068]] so [[H5921]] it is said, [[H559]] “Like Nimrod, [[H5248]] a mighty [[H1368]] hunter [[H6718]] before [[H6440]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
10 His kingdom [[H4467]] began [[H7225]] in Babylon, [[H894]] Erech, [[H751]] Accad, [[H390]] and Calneh, [[H3641]] in the land [[H776]] of Shinar. [[H8152]] 
11 From [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] he went forth [[H3318]] into Assyria, [[H804]] where he built [[H1129]] Nineveh, [[H5210]] Rehoboth-Ir, [[H7344]] Calah, [[H3625]] 
12 and Resen, [[H7449]] which is between [[H996]] Nineveh [[H5210]] and the great [[H1419]] city [[H5892]] of Calah. [[H3625]] 
13 And Mizraim [[H4714]] was the father of [[H3205]] the Ludites, [[H3866]] the Anamites, [[H6047]] the Lehabites, [[H3853]] the Naphtuhites, [[H5320]] 
14 the Pathrusites, [[H6625]] the Casluhites, [[H3695]] and [[H853]] the Caphtorites [[H3732]] (from [[H8033]] whom [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] came). [[H3318]] 
15 Canaan [[H3667]] was the father of [[H3205]] Sidon [[H6721]] his firstborn, [[H1060]] and of [[H853]] the Hittites, [[H2845]] 
16 the Jebusites, [[H2983]] the Amorites, [[H567]] the Girgashites, [[H1622]] 
17 the Hivites, [[H2340]] the Arkites, [[H6208]] the Sinites, [[H5513]] 
18 the Arvadites, [[H721]] the Zemarites, [[H6786]] and the Hamathites. [[H2577]] Later [[H310]] the Canaanite [[H3669]] clans [[H4940]] were scattered [[H6327]] 
19 and the borders [[H1366]] of Canaan [[H3669]] extended from [[H1961]] Sidon [[H6721]] toward Gerar [[H1642]] as [[H5704]] far as Gaza, [[H5804]] and then [[H935]] toward Sodom, [[H5467]] Gomorrah, [[H6017]] Admah, [[H126]] and Zeboiim, [[H6636]] as [[H5704]] far as Lasha. [[H3962]] 
20 These [are] [[H428]] the sons [[H1121]] of Ham [[H2526]] according to their clans, [[H4940]] languages, [[H3956]] lands, [[H776]] and nations. [[H1471]] 
21 And sons were also born [[H3205]] to Shem, [[H8035]] the older [[H1419]] brother [[H251]] [of] Japheth; [[H3315]] [Shem] [[H1931]] was the forefather [[H1]] of all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of Eber. [[H5677]] 
22 The sons [[H1121]] of Shem: [[H8035]] Elam, [[H5867]] Asshur, [[H804]] Arphaxad, [[H775]] Lud, [[H3865]] and Aram. [[H758]] 
23 The sons [[H1121]] of Aram: [[H758]] Uz, [[H5780]] Hul, [[H2343]] Gether, [[H1666]] and Mash. [[H4851]] 
24 And Arphaxad [[H775]] was the father of [[H3205]] Shelah, [[H7974]] and Shelah [[H7974]] was the father of [[H3205]] Eber. [[H5677]] 
25 And two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] were born [[H3205]] to Eber: [[H5677]] One [[H259]] was named [[H8034]] Peleg, [[H6389]] because [[H3588]] in his days [[H3117]] the earth [[H776]] was divided, [[H6385]] and his brother [[H251]] was named [[H8034]] Joktan. [[H3355]] 
26 And Joktan [[H3355]] was the father of [[H3205]] Almodad, [[H486]] Sheleph, [[H8026]] Hazarmaveth, [[H2700]] Jerah, [[H3392]] 
27 Hadoram, [[H1913]] Uzal, [[H187]] Diklah, [[H1853]] 
28 Obal, [[H5745]] Abimael, [[H39]] Sheba, [[H7614]] 
29 Ophir, [[H211]] Havilah, [[H2341]] and Jobab. [[H3103]] All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] [were] sons [[H1121]] of Joktan. [[H3355]] 
30 Their territory [[H4186]] extended from [[H935]] Mesha [[H4852]] to Sephar, [[H5611]] in the eastern [[H6924]] hill country. [[H2022]] 
31 These [[H428]] are the sons [[H1121]] of Shem, [[H8035]] according to their clans, [[H4940]] languages, [[H3956]] lands, [[H776]] and nations. [[H1471]] 
32 All these [[H428]] are the clans [[H4940]] of Noah’s [[H5146]] sons, [[H1121]] according to their generations [[H8435]] and nations. [[H1471]] From these [[H428]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth [[H776]] spread out [[H6504]] after [[H310]] the flood. [[H3999]]
