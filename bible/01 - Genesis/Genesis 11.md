# Genesis 11
[[Genesis 10|←]] • [[Genesis 12|→]]
1 Now the whole [[H3605]] world [[H776]] had [[H1961]] one [[H259]] language [[H8193]] and a common [[H259]] form of speech. [[H1697]] 
2 And [[H1961]] as people journeyed [[H5265]] eastward, [[H6924]] they found [[H4672]] a plain [[H1237]] in the land [[H776]] of Shinar [[H8152]] and settled [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]] 
3 And they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] “Come, [[H3051]] let us make [[H3835]] bricks [[H3843]] and bake [[H8313]] them thoroughly.” [[H8316]] So they used [[H1961]] brick [[H3843]] instead of stone, [[H68]] and tar [[H2564]] instead of mortar. [[H2563]] 
4 “Come,” [[H3051]] they said, [[H559]] “let us build [[H1129]] for ourselves  a city [[H5892]] with a tower [[H4026]] that reaches [[H7218]] to the heavens, [[H8064]] that we may make [[H6213]] a name for ourselves [[H8034]] and not [[H6435]] be scattered [[H6327]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth.” [[H776]] 
5 Then the LORD [[H3068]] came down [[H3381]] to see [[H7200]] the city [[H5892]] and the tower [[H4026]] that [[H834]] the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] were building. [[H1129]] 
6 And the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “If [[H2005]] they have begun [[H2490]] to do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] as one [[H259]] people [[H5971]] speaking the same [[H3605]] language, [[H8193]] then [[H6258]] nothing [[H3808]] they devise [[H2161]] will be beyond [[H1219]] them. [[H1992]] 
7 Come, [[H3051]] let Us go down [[H3381]] and confuse [[H1101]] their language, [[H8193]] so that [[H834]] they will not [[H3808]] understand [[H8085]] one [[H582]] another’s [[H7453]] speech.” [[H8193]] 
8 So the LORD [[H3068]] scattered them [[H6327]] from there [[H8033]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth, [[H776]] and they stopped [[H2308]] building [[H1129]] the city. [[H5892]] 
9 That is why [[H5921]] it [[H8034]] is called [[H7121]] Babel, [[H894]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] the LORD [[H3068]] confused [[H1101]] the language [[H8193]] of the whole [[H3605]] world, [[H776]] and from that place [[H8033]] the LORD [[H3068]] scattered [[H6327]] them over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth. [[H776]] 
10 This [[H428]] is the account [[H8435]] of Shem. [[H8035]] Two years [[H8141]] after [[H310]] the flood, [[H3999]] when Shem [[H8035]] was 100 [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] he became the father of [[H3205]] Arphaxad. [[H775]] 
11 And after [[H310]] he had become the father of [[H3205]] Arphaxad, [[H775]] Shem [[H8035]] lived [[H2421]] 500 [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] and had [[H3205]] other sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
12 When Arphaxad [[H775]] was [[H2421]] 35 [[H2568]] years old, [[H8141]] he became the father of [[H3205]] Shelah. [[H7974]] 
13 And after [[H310]] he had become the father of [[H3205]] Shelah, [[H7974]] Arphaxad [[H775]] lived [[H2421]] 403 [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] and had [[H3205]] other sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
14 When Shelah [[H7974]] was [[H2421]] 30 [[H7970]] years old, [[H8141]] he became the father of [[H3205]] Eber. [[H5677]] 
15 And after [[H310]] he had become the father of [[H3205]] Eber, [[H5677]] Shelah [[H7974]] lived [[H2421]] 403 [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] and had [[H3205]] other sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
16 When Eber [[H5677]] was [[H2421]] 34 [[H702]] years old, [[H8141]] he became the father of [[H3205]] Peleg. [[H6389]] 
17 And after [[H310]] he had become the father of [[H3205]] Peleg, [[H6389]] Eber [[H5677]] lived [[H2421]] 430 [[H7970]] years [[H8141]] and had [[H3205]] other sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
18 When Peleg [[H6389]] was [[H2421]] 30 [[H7970]] years old, [[H8141]] he became the father of [[H3205]] Reu. [[H7466]] 
19 And after [[H310]] he had become the father of [[H3205]] Reu, [[H7466]] Peleg [[H6389]] lived [[H2421]] 209 [[H8672]] years [[H8141]] and had [[H3205]] other sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
20 When Reu [[H7466]] was [[H2421]] 32 [[H8147]] years old, [[H8141]] he became the father of [[H3205]] Serug. [[H8286]] 
21 And after [[H310]] he had become the father of [[H3205]] Serug, [[H8286]] Reu [[H7466]] lived [[H2421]] 207 [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] and had [[H3205]] other sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
22 When Serug [[H8286]] was [[H2421]] 30 [[H7970]] years old, [[H8141]] he became the father of [[H3205]] Nahor. [[H5152]] 
23 And after [[H310]] he had become the father of [[H3205]] Nahor, [[H5152]] Serug [[H8286]] lived [[H2421]] 200 [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] and had [[H3205]] other sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
24 When Nahor [[H5152]] was [[H2421]] 29 [[H8672]] years old, [[H8141]] he became the father of [[H3205]] Terah. [[H8646]] 
25 And after [[H310]] he had become the father of [[H3205]] Terah, [[H8646]] Nahor [[H5152]] lived [[H2421]] 119 [[H8672]] years [[H8141]] and had [[H3205]] other sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
26 When Terah [[H8646]] was [[H2421]] 70 [[H7657]] years old, [[H8141]] he became the father of [[H3205]] Abram, [[H87]] Nahor, [[H5152]] and Haran. [[H2039]] 
27 This [[H428]] is the account [[H8435]] of Terah. [[H8646]] Terah [[H8646]] became the father of [[H3205]] Abram, [[H87]] Nahor, [[H5152]] and Haran. [[H2039]] And Haran [[H2039]] became the father of [[H3205]] Lot. [[H3876]] 
28 During [[H5921]] his father [[H1]] Terah’s lifetime, [[H8646]] Haran [[H2039]] died [[H4191]] in his native [[H4138]] land, [[H776]] in Ur [[H218]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] 
29 And Abram [[H87]] and Nahor [[H5152]] took [[H3947]] wives {for themselves}. [[H802]] Abram’s [[H87]] wife [[H802]] was named [[H8034]] Sarai, [[H8297]] and Nahor’s [[H5152]] wife [[H802]] was named [[H8034]] Milcah; [[H4435]] she was the daughter [[H1323]] of Haran, [[H2039]] the father [[H1]] of both Milcah [[H4435]] and Iscah. [[H3252]] 
30 But Sarai [[H8297]] was [[H1961]] barren; [[H6135]] she had no [[H369]] children. [[H2056]] 
31 And Terah [[H8646]] took [[H3947]] his son [[H1121]] Abram, [[H87]] his grandson [[H1121]] Lot [[H3876]] son [[H1121]] of Haran, [[H2039]] and [[H853]] his daughter-in-law [[H3618]] Sarai [[H8297]] the wife [[H802]] of Abram, [[H87]] and they set out [[H3318]] from Ur [[H218]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] for [[H1980]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]] But when they arrived [[H935]] in [[H5704]] Haran, [[H2771]] they settled [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]] 
32 Terah [[H8646]] lived [[H1961]] 205 [[H2568]] years, [[H8141]] and he died [[H4191]] in Haran. [[H2771]]
