# Genesis 29
[[Genesis 28|←]] • [[Genesis 30|→]]
1 Jacob [[H3290]] resumed his journey [[H5375]] and came [[H1980]] to the land [[H776]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the east. [[H6924]] 
2 He looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] a well [[H875]] in the field, [[H7704]] and [[H2009]] there [[H8033]] by it [[H5921]] lay [[H7257]] three [[H7969]] flocks [[H5739]] of sheep, [[H6629]] because [[H3588]] the sheep [[H5739]] were watered [[H8248]] from [[H4480]] this [[H1931]] well. [[H875]] And a large [[H1419]] stone [[H68]] covered [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the well. [[H875]] 
3 When all [[H3605]] the flocks [[H5739]] had been gathered [[H622]] there, [[H8033]] the shepherds would roll away [[H1556]] the stone [[H68]] from [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the well [[H875]] and water [[H8248]] the sheep. [[H6629]] Then they would return [[H7725]] the stone [[H68]] to its place [[H4725]] over [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the well. [[H875]] 
4 “My brothers,” [[H251]] Jacob [[H3290]] asked [[H559]] the [shepherds],  “where [[H370]] are you from?” [[H859]] “We are [[H587]] from Haran,” [[H2771]] they answered. [[H559]] 
5 “Do you know [[H3045]] Laban [[H3837]] grandson [[H1121]] of Nahor?” [[H5152]] Jacob asked. [[H559]] “We know him,” [[H3045]] they replied. [[H559]] 
6 “Is he well?” [[H7965]] Jacob inquired. [[H559]] “Yes,” [[H7965]] they answered, [[H559]] “and here [[H2009]] comes [[H935]] his daughter [[H1323]] Rachel [[H7354]] with [[H5973]] his sheep.” [[H6629]] 
7 “Look,” [[H2005]] said Jacob, [[H559]] “it is still [[H5750]] broad [[H1419]] daylight; [[H3117]] it is not yet [[H3808]] time [[H6256]] to gather [[H622]] the livestock. [[H4735]] Water [[H8248]] the sheep [[H6629]] and take them back [[H1980]] to pasture.” [[H7462]] 
8 But they replied, [[H559]] “We cannot, [[H3808]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the flocks [[H5739]] have been gathered [[H622]] and the stone [[H68]] has been rolled [[H1556]] away from [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the well. [[H875]] Then we will water [[H8248]] the sheep.” [[H6629]] 
9 While [[H5750]] he was still speaking [[H1696]] with them, [[H5973]] Rachel [[H7354]] arrived [[H935]] with [[H5973]] her father’s [[H1]] sheep, [[H6629]] for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] was a shepherdess. [[H7462]] 
10 As soon as [[H834]] Jacob [[H3290]] saw [[H7200]] Rachel, [[H7354]] the daughter [[H1323]] of his mother’s [[H517]] brother [[H251]] Laban, [[H3837]] with Laban’s [[H3837]] sheep, [[H6629]] he [[H3290]] went up [[H5066]] and rolled [[H1556]] the stone [[H68]] away from [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the well [[H875]] and watered [[H8248]] his uncle’s [[H251]] sheep. [[H6629]] 
11 Then Jacob [[H3290]] kissed [[H5401]] Rachel [[H7354]] and wept [[H1058]] aloud. [[H5375]] 
12 He [[H3290]] told [[H5046]] Rachel [[H7354]] that [[H3588]] he was [[H1931]] Rebekah’s [[H7259]] son, [[H1121]] a relative [[H251]] of her father, [[H1]] and she ran [[H7323]] and told [[H5046]] her father. [[H1]] 
13 When Laban [[H3837]] heard [[H8085]] the news [[H8088]] about his sister’s [[H269]] son [[H1121]] Jacob, [[H3290]] he ran out [[H7323]] to meet him, [[H7125]] and he embraced [[H2263]] him  and kissed him. [[H5401]] Then he took [[H935]] him to [[H413]] his home, [[H1004]] and Jacob told [[H5608]] him [[H3837]] all [[H3605]] that had happened. [[H1697]] 
14 Then Laban [[H3837]] declared, [[H559]] “You are [[H859]] indeed [[H389]] my own flesh [[H1320]] and blood.” [[H6106]] After Jacob had stayed [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] him a month, [[H2320]] 
15 Laban [[H3837]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H3290]] “Just because [[H3588]] you are [[H859]] my relative, [[H251]] should you work [[H5647]] for nothing? [[H2600]] Tell [[H5046]] me  what [[H4100]] your wages should be.” [[H4909]] 
16 Now Laban [[H3837]] had two [[H8147]] daughters; [[H1323]] the older [[H1419]] was named [[H8034]] Leah, [[H3812]] and the younger [[H6996]] was named [[H8034]] Rachel. [[H7354]] 
17 Leah [[H3812]] had no sparkle [[H7390]] in her eyes, [[H5869]] but Rachel [[H7354]] was [[H1961]] shapely [[H3303]] and beautiful. [[H3303]] 
18 Since Jacob [[H3290]] loved [[H157]] Rachel, [[H7354]] he answered, [[H559]] “I will serve [[H5647]] you seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] for your younger [[H6996]] daughter [[H1323]] Rachel.” [[H7354]] 
19 Laban [[H3837]] replied, [[H559]] “Better [[H2896]] that I give [[H5414]] her [[H853]] to you  than [[H5414]] to another. [[H312]] Stay here [[H3427]] with me.” [[H5978]] 
20 So Jacob [[H3290]] served [[H5647]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] for Rachel, [[H7354]] yet it seemed [[H5869]] [but] a few [[H259]] days [[H3117]] because of his love [[H157]] for her. [[H853]] 
21 Finally Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Laban, [[H3837]] “Grant [[H3051]] me my wife, [[H802]] for [[H3588]] my time [[H3117]] is complete, [[H4390]] and I want to sleep with [[H935]] her.” [[H413]] 
22 So Laban [[H3837]] invited all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of that place [[H4725]] and prepared [[H6213]] a feast. [[H4960]] 
23 But when [[H1961]] evening came, [[H6153]] Laban took [[H3947]] his daughter [[H1323]] Leah [[H3812]] and gave [[H935]] her to Jacob, [[H413]] and he slept with [[H935]] her. [[H413]] 
24 And Laban [[H3837]] gave [[H5414]] his servant girl [[H8198]] Zilpah [[H2153]] to his daughter [[H1323]] Leah [[H3812]] as her maidservant. [[H8198]] 
25 When morning [[H1242]] came, [[H1961]] there [[H2009]] was Leah! [[H3812]] “What [[H4100]] have you done [[H6213]] to me?”  Jacob said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Laban. [[H3837]] “Wasn’t [[H3808]] it for Rachel [[H7354]] that I served [[H5647]] you? [[H5973]] Why [[H4100]] have you deceived me?” [[H7411]] 
26 Laban [[H3837]] replied, [[H559]] “It is not [[H3808]] our custom [[H6213]] here [[H4725]] to give the younger daughter [[H6810]] in marriage [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] the older. [[H1067]] 
27 Finish [[H4390]] this [[H2063]] week’s celebration, [[H7620]] and we will give [[H5414]] you  the younger one [[H2063]] in return for [[H5647]] another [[H312]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of work.” [[H5656]] 
28 And Jacob [[H3290]] did [[H6213]] just that. [[H3651]] He finished [[H4390]] the week’s celebration, [[H7620]] and Laban gave [[H5414]] him [[H853]] his daughter [[H1323]] Rachel [[H7354]] as his wife. [[H802]] 
29 Laban also [[H3837]] gave [[H5414]] his servant girl [[H8198]] Bilhah [[H1090]] to his daughter [[H1323]] Rachel [[H7354]] as her  maidservant. [[H8198]] 
30 Jacob slept with [[H935]] Rachel [[H7354]] as well, [[H1571]] and indeed, [[H1571]] he loved [[H157]] Rachel [[H7354]] more than Leah. [[H3812]] So he worked [[H5647]] for [[H5973]] Laban [[H5750]] another [[H312]] seven [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]] 
31 When the LORD [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Leah [[H3812]] was unloved, [[H8130]] He opened [[H6605]] her womb; [[H7358]] but Rachel [[H7354]] [was] barren. [[H6135]] 
32 And Leah [[H3812]] conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and she named [[H7121]] him Reuben, [[H7205]] for [[H3588]] she said, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has seen [[H7200]] my affliction. [[H6040]] Surely [[H3588]] my husband [[H376]] will love [[H157]] me now.” [[H6258]] 
33 Again [[H5750]] she conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and she said, [[H559]] “Because the LORD [[H3068]] has heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am unloved, [[H8130]] He has given [[H5414]] me  this [son] [[H2088]] as well.” [[H1571]] So she named [[H7121]] him Simeon. [[H8095]] 
34 Once again [[H5750]] [Leah] conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and she said, [[H559]] “Now [[H6258]] at last [[H6471]] my husband [[H376]] will become attached [[H3867]] to me, [[H413]] because [[H3588]] I have borne [[H3205]] him  three [[H7969]] sons.” [[H1121]] So [[H5921]] he was named [[H7121]] Levi. [[H3878]] 
35 And once more, [[H5750]] she conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] and said, [[H559]] “This time [[H6471]] I will praise [[H3034]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] So [[H5921]] she named [[H7121]] him Judah. [[H3063]] Then Leah stopped [[H5975]] having children. [[H3205]]
