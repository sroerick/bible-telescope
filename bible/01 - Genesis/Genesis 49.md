[[Genesis 48|←]] • [[Genesis 50|→]]
1 Then Jacob [[H3290]] called for [[H7121]] his sons [[H1121]] and said, [[H559]] “Gather around [[H622]] so that I can tell [[H5046]] you [[H853]] what [[H834]] will happen [[H7122]] to you [[H853]] in the days [[H3117]] to come: [[H319]] 
2 Come together [[H6908]] and listen, [[H8085]] O sons [[H1121]] of Jacob; [[H3290]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] your father [[H1]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
3 Reuben, [[H7205]] you [[H859]] are my firstborn, [[H1060]] my might, [[H3581]] and the beginning [[H7225]] of my strength, [[H202]] excelling [[H3499]] in honor, [[H7613]] excelling [[H3499]] in power. [[H5794]] 
4 Uncontrolled [[H6349]] as the waters, [[H4325]] you will no [[H408]] longer excel, [[H3498]] because [[H3588]] you went up [[H5927]] to your father’s [[H1]] bed, [[H4904]] onto [[H5927]] my couch [[H3326]] and [[H227]] defiled it. [[H2490]] 
5 Simeon [[H8095]] and Levi [[H3878]] are brothers; [[H251]] their swords [[H4380]] are weapons [[H3627]] of violence. [[H2555]] 
6 May I [[H5315]] never [[H408]] enter [[H935]] their council; [[H5475]] may I [[H3519]] never [[H408]] join [[H3161]] their assembly. [[H6951]] For [[H3588]] they kill [[H2026]] men [[H376]] in their anger, [[H639]] and hamstring [[H6131]] oxen [[H7794]] on a whim. [[H7522]] 
7 Cursed [be] [[H779]] their anger, [[H639]] for [[H3588]] it is strong, [[H5794]] and their wrath, [[H5678]] for [[H3588]] it is cruel! [[H7185]] I will disperse [[H2505]] them in Jacob [[H3290]] and scatter [[H6327]] them in Israel. [[H3478]] 
8 Judah, [[H3063]] your brothers [[H251]] shall praise you. [[H3034]] Your hand [[H3027]] shall be on the necks [[H6203]] of your enemies; [[H341]] your father’s [[H1]] sons [[H1121]] shall bow down [[H7812]] to you.  
9 Judah [[H3063]] is a young [[H1482]] lion— [[H738]] my son, [[H1121]] you return [[H5927]] from the prey. [[H2964]] Like a lion [[H738]] he crouches [[H3766]] [and] lies down; [[H7257]] like a lioness, [[H3833]] who [[H4310]] dares to rouse him? [[H6965]] 
10 The scepter [[H7626]] will not [[H3808]] depart [[H5493]] from Judah, [[H3063]] nor the staff [[H2710]] from between [[H996]] his feet, [[H7272]] until [[H5704]] Shiloh [[H7886]] comes [[H935]] and the allegiance [[H3349]] of the nations is his. [[H5971]] 
11 He ties [[H631]] his donkey [[H5895]] to the vine, [[H1612]] his colt [[H1121]] to the choicest branch. [[H8321]] He washes [[H3526]] his garments [[H3830]] in wine, [[H3196]] his robes [[H5497]] in the blood [[H1818]] of grapes. [[H6025]] 
12 His eyes [[H5869]] are darker [[H2447]] than wine, [[H3196]] and his teeth [[H8127]] are whiter [[H3836]] than milk. [[H2461]] 
13 Zebulun [[H2074]] shall dwell [[H7931]] by the seashore [[H2348]] and become a harbor [[H2348]] for ships; [[H591]] his border [[H3411]] shall extend [[H5921]] to Sidon. [[H6721]] 
14 Issachar [[H3485]] [is] a strong [[H1634]] donkey, [[H2543]] lying down [[H7257]] between [[H996]] the sheepfolds. [[H4942]] 
15 He saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] his resting place [[H4496]] was good [[H2896]] and that [[H3588]] his land [[H776]] was pleasant, [[H5276]] so he bent [[H5186]] his shoulder [[H7926]] to the burden [[H5445]] and submitted [[H1961]] to labor [[H4522]] as a servant. [[H5647]] 
16 Dan [[H1835]] shall provide justice [[H1777]] for his people [[H5971]] as one [[H259]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
17 He [[H1835]] will be [[H1961]] a serpent [[H5175]] by [[H5921]] the road, [[H1870]] a viper [[H8207]] in [[H5921]] the path, [[H734]] that bites [[H5391]] the horse’s [[H5483]] heels [[H6119]] so that its rider [[H7392]] tumbles [[H5307]] backward. [[H268]] 
18 I await [[H6960]] Your salvation, [[H3444]] O LORD. [[H3068]] 
19 Gad [[H1410]] will be attacked [[H1464]] by raiders, [[H1416]] but he [[H1931]] will attack [[H1464]] their heels. [[H6119]] 
20 Asher’s [[H836]] food [[H3899]] will be rich; [[H8082]] he [[H1931]] shall provide [[H5414]] royal [[H4428]] delicacies. [[H4574]] 
21 Naphtali [[H5321]] is a doe [[H355]] set free [[H7971]] that bears [[H5414]] beautiful [[H8233]] fawns. [[H561]] 
22 Joseph [[H3130]] is a fruitful [[H6509]] vine, [[H1121]] a fruitful [[H6509]] vine [[H1121]] by [[H5921]] a spring, [[H5869]] whose branches [[H1323]] scale [[H6805]] the wall. [[H7791]] 
23 The archers [[H1167]] attacked him with bitterness, [[H4843]] and aimed [[H7232]] in hostility. [[H7852]] 
24 Yet he steadied [[H3427]] his bow, [[H7198]] and his strong arms [[H2220]] were tempered [[H6339]] by the hands [[H3027]] of the Mighty One [[H46]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] in the name of [[H8033]] the Shepherd, [[H7462]] the Rock [[H68]] of Israel, [[H3478]] 
25 by the God [[H410]] of your father [[H1]] who helps you, [[H5826]] and by the Almighty [[H7706]] who blesses you, [[H1288]] with blessings [[H1293]] of the heavens [[H8064]] above, [[H5921]] with blessings [[H1293]] of the depths [[H8415]] below, [[H8478]] with blessings [[H1293]] of the breasts [[H7699]] and womb. [[H7356]] 
26 The blessings [[H1293]] of your father [[H1]] have surpassed [[H1396]] the blessings [[H1293]] of the ancient mountains [[H2029]] and the bounty [[H8379]] of the everlasting [[H5769]] hills. [[H1389]] May they rest [[H1961]] on the head [[H7218]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] on the brow [[H6936]] of the prince [[H5139]] of his brothers. [[H251]] 
27 Benjamin [[H1144]] is a ravenous wolf; [[H2061]] in the morning [[H1242]] he devours [[H398]] the prey, [[H5706]] in the evening [[H6153]] he divides [[H2505]] the plunder.” [[H7998]] 
28 These [[H428]] are the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] twelve [[H8147]] in all, [[H3605]] and this [[H2063]] was what [[H834]] their father [[H1]] said [[H1696]] to them.  He blessed them, [[H1288]] and he blessed [[H1288]] each one [[H834]] with a suitable blessing. [[H1293]] 
29 Then [Jacob] instructed them, [[H6680]] “I [[H589]] am about to be gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] my people. [[H5971]] Bury [[H6912]] me with [[H413]] my fathers [[H1]] in [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] in the field [[H7704]] of Ephron [[H6085]] the Hittite. [[H2850]] 
30 The cave [[H4631]] is in the field [[H7704]] of Machpelah [[H4375]] near [[H5921]] Mamre, [[H4471]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]] This [[H834]] is the field [[H7704]] Abraham [[H85]] purchased [[H7069]] from [[H853]] Ephron [[H6085]] the Hittite [[H2850]] as a burial [[H6913]] site. [[H272]] 
31 There [[H8033]] Abraham [[H85]] and his wife [[H802]] Sarah [[H8283]] are buried, [[H6912]] there [[H8033]] Isaac [[H3327]] and his wife [[H802]] Rebekah [[H7259]] are buried, [[H6912]] and there [[H8033]] I buried [[H6912]] Leah. [[H3812]] 
32 The field [[H7704]] and the cave [[H4631]] that is [[H834]] in it  were purchased [[H4735]] from the Hittites.” [[H1121]] 
33 When Jacob [[H3290]] had finished [[H3615]] instructing [[H6680]] his sons, [[H1121]] he pulled [[H622]] his feet [[H7272]] into [[H413]] the bed [[H4296]] and breathed his last, [[H1478]] and he was gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] his people. [[H5971]]
