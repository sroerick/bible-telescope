1 This [[H428]] is the account [[H8435]] of Esau [[H6215]] (that is, [[H1931]] Edom). [[H123]] 
2 Esau [[H6215]] took [[H3947]] his wives [[H802]] from the daughters [[H1323]] of Canaan: [[H3667]] Adah [[H5711]] daughter [[H1323]] of Elon [[H356]] the Hittite, [[H2850]] Oholibamah [[H173]] daughter [[H1323]] of Anah [[H6034]] and granddaughter [[H1323]] of Zibeon [[H6649]] the Hivite, [[H2340]] 
3 and Basemath [[H1315]] daughter [[H1323]] of Ishmael [[H3458]] and sister [[H269]] of Nebaioth. [[H5032]] 
4 And Adah [[H5711]] bore [[H3205]] Eliphaz [[H464]] to Esau, [[H6215]] Basemath [[H1315]] gave birth to [[H3205]] Reuel, [[H7467]] 
5 and Oholibamah [[H173]] gave birth to [[H3205]] Jeush, [[H3266]] Jalam, [[H3281]] and Korah. [[H7141]] These [[H428]] [were] the sons [[H1121]] of Esau, [[H6215]] who [[H834]] were born [[H3205]] to him in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]] 
6 Later, Esau [[H6215]] took [[H3947]] his wives [[H802]] and [[H853]] sons [[H1121]] and [[H853]] daughters [[H1323]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5315]] of his household, [[H1004]] along with [[H853]] his livestock, [[H4735]] all [[H3605]] his [other] animals, [[H929]] and all [[H3605]] the property [[H7075]] he had acquired [[H7408]] in Canaan, [[H3667]] and he moved [[H1980]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] far away from [[H6440]] his brother [[H251]] Jacob. [[H3290]] 
7 For [[H3588]] their possessions [[H7399]] were [[H1961]] too great [[H7227]] for them to dwell [[H3427]] together; [[H3162]] the land [[H776]] where they stayed [[H4033]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] support them [[H5375]] because [[H6440]] of their livestock. [[H4735]]
