[[Genesis 6|←]] • [[Genesis 8|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to Noah, [[H5146]] “Go [[H935]] into [[H413]] the ark, [[H8392]] you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] your family, [[H1004]] because [[H3588]] I have found [[H7200]] you [[H853]] righteous [[H6662]] in this [[H2088]] generation. [[H1755]] 
2 You  {are to} take with you [[H3947]] seven [[H7651]] of every kind of [[H3605]] clean [[H2889]] animal, [[H929]] a male [[H376]] and its mate, [[H802]] [and] two [[H8147]] of [[H4480]] [every kind of] [[H834]] unclean [[H2889]] animal, [[H929]] a male [[H376]] and its mate, [[H802]] 
3 and also [[H1571]] seven [[H7651]] of [every kind of] bird [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] male [[H2145]] and female, [[H5347]] in order to preserve [[H2421]] their offspring [[H2233]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]] 
4 For [[H3588]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] from now [[H5750]] I [[H595]] will send rain [[H4305]] on [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] for forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights, [[H3915]] and I will wipe [[H4229]] from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth [[H127]] every [[H3605]] living thing [[H3351]] I have made.” [[H6213]] 
5 And Noah [[H5146]] did [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded him. [[H6680]] 
6 Now Noah [[H5146]] was 600 [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when the floodwaters [[H3999]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]] 
7 And Noah [[H5146]] entered [[H935]] the ark, [[H8392]] along with [[H854]] his sons [[H1121]] and his wife [[H802]] and his sons’ [[H1121]] wives, [[H802]] to escape [[H6440]] the waters [[H4325]] of the flood. [[H3999]] 
8 [The] [[H4480]] clean [[H2889]] and [[H4480]] unclean [[H2889]] animals, [[H929]] the birds, [[H5775]] and everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] crawls [[H7430]] along [[H5921]] the ground [[H127]] 
9 came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Noah [[H5146]] to enter [[H413]] the ark, [[H8392]] two [[H8147]] by two, [[H8147]] male [[H2145]] and female, [[H5347]] as [[H834]] God [[H430]] had commanded [[H6680]] [him]. [[H5146]] 
10 And after [[H1961]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] the floodwaters [[H4325]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]] 
11 In [[H8141]] the six [[H8337]] hundredth [[H3967]] year [[H8141]] of Noah’s [[H5146]] life, [[H2416]] on the seventeenth [[H7651]] day [[H3117]] of the second [[H8145]] month, [[H2320]] all [[H3605]] the fountains [[H4599]] of the great [[H7227]] deep [[H8415]] burst forth, [[H1234]] and [[H6240]] the floodgates [[H699]] of the heavens [[H8064]] were opened. [[H6605]] 
12 And the rain [[H1653]] fell [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights. [[H3915]] 
13 On that very [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] Noah [[H5146]] entered [[H935]] the ark, [[H8392]] [along with his] sons [[H1121]] Shem, [[H8035]] Ham, [[H2526]] and Japheth, [[H3315]] and [his] [[H5146]] wife, [[H802]] and the three [[H7969]] wives [[H802]] of his sons— [[H1121]] 
14 they [[H1992]] and [[H3605]] every [[H3605]] kind of [[H4327]] wild animal, [[H2416]] livestock, [[H929]] crawling creature, [[H7431]] bird, [[H5775]] and [[H3605]] winged creature. [[H6833]] 
15 They came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Noah [[H5146]] to enter [[H413]] the ark, [[H8392]] two [[H8147]] by two [[H8147]] of every [[H3605]] creature [[H1320]] with [[H834]] the breath [[H7307]] of life. [[H2416]] 
16 And they entered, [[H935]] the male [[H2145]] and female [[H5347]] of every [[H3605]] living thing, [[H1320]] as [[H834]] God [[H430]] had commanded [[H6680]] [Noah]. [[H853]] Then the LORD [[H3068]] shut him in. [[H5462]] 
17 For forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] the flood [[H3999]] kept coming [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] and the waters [[H4325]] rose [[H7235]] and lifted [[H5375]] the ark [[H8392]] high above [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]] 
18 So the waters [[H4325]] continued to surge [[H1396]] and rise [[H7235]] greatly [[H3966]] on [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] and [[H1980]] the ark [[H8392]] floated on [[H5921]] the surface [[H6440]] of the waters. [[H4325]] 
19 Finally, the waters [[H4325]] completely [[H3966]] inundated [[H1396]] the earth, [[H776]] so that all [[H3605]] the high [[H1364]] mountains [[H2022]] under [[H8478]] all [[H3605]] the heavens [[H8064]] were covered. [[H3680]] 
20 The waters [[H4325]] rose [[H1396]] and covered [[H3680]] the mountaintops [[H2022]] to a depth [[H4605]] of fifteen [[H2568]] cubits. [[H520]] 
21 And every [[H3605]] creature [[H1320]] that had moved [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] perished— [[H1478]] birds, [[H5775]] livestock, [[H929]] animals, [[H2416]] every [[H3605]] creature that swarms [[H8318]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] mankind. [[H120]] 
22 Of all [[H3605]] that [had been] [[H834]] on dry land, [[H2724]] everything [[H3605]] that had [[H834]] the breath [[H5397]] of [[H7307]] life [[H2416]] in its nostrils [[H639]] died. [[H4191]] 
23 And every [[H3605]] living thing [[H3351]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth [[H127]] was destroyed— [[H4229]] man [[H120]] and [[H5704]] livestock, [[H929]] crawling creatures [[H7431]] and birds [[H5775]] of the air; [[H8064]] they were blotted out [[H4229]] from [[H4480]] the earth, [[H776]] and only [[H389]] Noah [[H5146]] remained, [[H7604]] and those [[H834]] with him [[H854]] in the ark. [[H8392]] 
24 And the waters [[H4325]] prevailed [[H1396]] upon [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] for 150 [[H3967]] days. [[H3117]]
