1 Now there was [[H1961]] another famine [[H7458]] in the land, [[H776]] subsequent to [[H905]] the [one] [[H7458]] that [[H834]] had occurred [[H1961]] in Abraham’s [[H85]] time. [[H3117]] And Isaac [[H3327]] went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Abimelech [[H40]] king [[H4428]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] at Gerar. [[H1642]] 
2 The LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] [Isaac] and said, [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] go down [[H3381]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] Settle [[H7931]] in the land [[H776]] where [[H834]] I tell you. [[H559]] 
3 Stay in this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] as a foreigner, [[H1481]] and I will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] you and bless you. [[H1288]] For [[H3588]] I will give [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] these [[H411]] lands [[H776]] to you  and your offspring, [[H2233]] and I will confirm [[H6965]] the oath [[H7621]] that [[H834]] I swore [[H7650]] to your father [[H1]] Abraham. [[H85]] 
4 I will make your descendants [[H2233]] as numerous [[H7235]] as the stars [[H3556]] in the sky, [[H8064]] and I will give [[H5414]] [them] [[H2233]] all [[H3605]] these [[H411]] lands, [[H776]] and through your offspring [[H2233]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] of the earth [[H776]] will be blessed, [[H1288]] 
5 because [[H6118]] Abraham [[H85]] listened [[H8085]] to My voice [[H6963]] and kept [[H8104]] My charge, [[H4931]] My commandments, [[H4687]] My statutes, [[H2708]] and My laws.” [[H8451]] 
6 So Isaac [[H3327]] settled [[H3427]] in Gerar. [[H1642]] 
7 But when the men [[H376]] of that place [[H4725]] asked [[H7592]] about his wife, [[H802]] he said, [[H559]] “She [[H1931]] is my sister.” [[H269]] For [[H3588]] he was afraid [[H3372]] to say, [[H559]] “[She is] my wife,” [[H802]] since he thought to himself, [[H6435]] “The men [[H376]] of this place [[H4725]] will kill [[H2026]] me on account of [[H5921]] Rebekah, [[H7259]] because [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] is so beautiful.” [[H2896]] 
8 When [[H3588]] Isaac had been there [[H8033]] a long time, [[H3117]] Abimelech [[H40]] king [[H4428]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] looked down [[H8259]] from [[H1157]] the window [[H2474]] and was surprised to see [[H7200]] Isaac [[H3327]] caressing [[H6711]] his wife [[H802]] Rebekah. [[H7259]] 
9 Abimelech [[H40]] sent for [[H7121]] Isaac [[H3327]] and said, [[H559]] “So she [[H1931]] is really [[H389]] your wife! [[H802]] How [[H349]] could you say, [[H559]] ‘She [[H1931]] is my sister’?” [[H269]] Isaac [[H3327]] replied, [[H559]] “Because [[H3588]] I thought [[H559]] I might [[H6435]] die [[H4191]] on account of her.” [[H5921]] 
10 “What [[H4100]] is this [[H2063]] you have done [[H6213]] to us?”  Abimelech [[H40]] said, [[H559]] “One [[H259]] of the people [[H5971]] could easily [[H4592]] have slept with [[H7901]] your wife, [[H802]] and you would have brought [[H935]] guilt [[H817]] upon us.” [[H5921]] 
11 So Abimelech [[H40]] warned [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] “Whoever harms [[H5060]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] or his wife [[H802]] will surely [[H4191]] be put to death.” [[H4191]] 
12 Now Isaac [[H3327]] sowed seed [[H2232]] in the [[H1931]] land, [[H776]] and in that very [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] he reaped [[H4672]] a hundredfold. [[H3967]] And the LORD [[H3068]] blessed him, [[H1288]] 
13 and [he] [[H376]] became richer and richer, [[H1431]] until [[H5704]] he was exceedingly [[H3966]] wealthy. [[H1431]] 
14 He owned so many [[H1961]] flocks [[H4735]] and herds [[H4735]] and [[H7227]] servants [[H5657]] that the Philistines [[H6430]] envied him. [[H7065]] 
15 So the Philistines [[H6430]] took [[H4390]] dirt [[H6083]] and stopped up [[H5640]] all [[H3605]] the wells [[H875]] that [[H834]] his father’s [[H1]] servants [[H5650]] had dug [[H2658]] in the days [[H3117]] of his father [[H1]] Abraham. [[H85]] 
16 Then Abimelech [[H40]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Isaac, [[H3327]] “Depart from [[H1980]] us, [[H5973]] for [[H3588]] you are much [[H3966]] too powerful [[H6105]] for us.” [[H4480]] 
17 So Isaac [[H3327]] left [[H1980]] that place [[H8033]] and encamped [[H2583]] in the Valley [[H5158]] of Gerar [[H1642]] and settled [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]] 
18 Isaac [[H3327]] reopened [[H7725]] the wells [[H875]] that [[H834]] had been dug [[H2658]] in the days [[H3117]] of his father [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] which the Philistines [[H6430]] had stopped up [[H5640]] after [[H310]] Abraham [[H85]] died. [[H4194]] And he gave [[H7121]] [these wells]  the same names [[H8034]] his father [[H1]] had given them. [[H7121]] 
19 Then Isaac’s [[H3327]] servants [[H5650]] dug [[H2658]] in the valley [[H5158]] and found [[H4672]] a well [[H875]] of fresh water [[H4325]] there. [[H8033]] 
20 But the herdsmen [[H7473]] of Gerar [[H1642]] quarreled [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] Isaac’s [[H3327]] herdsmen [[H7473]] and said, [[H559]] “The water is ours!” [[H4325]] So he named [[H7121]] the well [[H875]] Esek, [[H6230]] because [[H3588]] they contended [[H6229]] with him. [[H5973]] 
21 And they dug [[H2658]] another [[H312]] well [[H875]] and quarreled [[H7378]] over [[H5921]] that one also; [[H1571]] so he named [[H7121]] it [[H8034]] Sitnah. [[H7856]] 
22 He moved on [[H6275]] from there [[H8033]] and dug [[H2658]] another [well], [[H312]] and they did not [[H3808]] quarrel [[H7378]] over it. [[H5921]] He named [[H7121]] it [[H8034]] Rehoboth [[H7344]] and said, [[H559]] “At last [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has made room [[H7337]] for us,  and we will be fruitful [[H6509]] in the land.” [[H776]] 
23 From there [[H8033]] [Isaac] went up [[H5927]] to Beersheba, [[H884]] 
24 and that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to him [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] am the God [[H430]] of your father [[H1]] Abraham. [[H85]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am with you. [[H854]] I will bless [[H1288]] you and multiply [[H7235]] your descendants [[H2233]] for the sake [[H5668]] of My servant [[H5650]] Abraham. [[H85]] 
25 So he built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] there [[H8033]] and called [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and he pitched [[H5186]] his tent [[H168]] there. [[H8033]] Isaac’s [[H3327]] servants [[H5650]] also dug [[H3738]] a well [[H875]] there. [[H8033]] 
26 Later, Abimelech [[H40]] came [[H1980]] to [Isaac] [[H413]] from Gerar, [[H1642]] with Ahuzzath [[H276]] his adviser [[H4828]] and Phicol [[H6369]] the commander [[H8269]] of his army. [[H6635]] 
27 “Why [[H4069]] have you come [[H935]] to me?” [[H413]] Isaac [[H3327]] asked [[H559]] them. [[H413]] “You [[H859]] hated [[H8130]] me [[H853]] and sent me away.” [[H7971]] 
28 “We can plainly see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has been [[H1961]] with you,” [[H5973]] they replied. [[H559]] “We think [[H559]] there should be [[H1961]] an oath [[H423]] between two parties— [[H996]] between us and you. [[H996]] Let us make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with you [[H5973]] 
29 that you will not [[H518]] harm [[H6213]] us, [[H7451]] just as [[H834]] we have not [[H3808]] harmed you, [[H5060]] and [[H834]] we have done [[H6213]] nothing but [[H7535]] good [[H2896]] to you, [[H5973]] sending you on your way [[H7971]] in peace. [[H7965]] And now [[H6258]] you [[H859]] are blessed [[H1288]] by the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
30 So [Isaac] prepared [[H6213]] a feast for them, [[H4960]] and they ate [[H398]] and drank. [[H8354]] 
31 And they got up early [[H7925]] the next morning [[H1242]] and swore an oath [[H7650]] to each [[H376]] other. [[H251]] Then Isaac [[H3327]] sent them on their way, [[H7971]] and they left [[H1980]] him in peace. [[H7965]] 
32 On that same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Isaac’s [[H3327]] servants [[H5650]] came [[H935]] to tell [[H5046]] him  about [[H5921]] the well [[H875]] they had dug, [[H2658]] telling him, [[H559]] “We have found [[H4672]] water!” [[H4325]] 
33 He called [[H7121]] it [[H853]] Shibah, [[H7656]] and [[H5921]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] the name [[H8034]] of the city [[H5892]] is Beersheba. [[H884]] 
34 When Esau [[H6215]] was [[H1961]] forty [[H705]] years old, [[H1121]] he took [[H3947]] as his wives [[H802]] Judith [[H3067]] daughter [[H1323]] of Beeri [[H882]] the Hittite [[H2850]] and Basemath [[H1315]] daughter [[H1323]] of Elon [[H356]] the Hittite. [[H2850]] 
35 And [[H1961]] they brought [[H7307]] grief [[H4786]] to Isaac [[H3327]] and Rebekah. [[H7259]]
