1 After [[H1961]] two full years [[H8141]] had passed, [[H7093]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] had a dream: [[H2492]] He was standing [[H5975]] beside [[H5921]] the Nile, [[H2975]] 
2 when seven [[H7651]] cows, [[H6510]] sleek [[H3303]] and well-fed, [[H1277]] came up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the river [[H2975]] and began to graze [[H7462]] among the reeds. [[H260]] 
3 After them, [[H310]] seven [[H7651]] other [[H312]] cows, [[H6510]] sickly [[H7451]] and thin, [[H1851]] came up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the Nile [[H2975]] and stood [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] the [other] cows [[H6510]] on [[H5921]] the bank [[H8193]] of the river. [[H2975]] 
4 And the cows [[H6510]] [that were] sickly [[H7451]] and thin [[H1851]] ate up [[H398]] the seven [[H7651]] sleek, [[H3303]] well-fed [[H1277]] cows. [[H6510]] Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] woke up, [[H3364]] 
5 but he fell back asleep [[H3462]] and dreamed [[H2492]] a second time: [[H8145]] Seven [[H7651]] heads of grain, [[H7641]] plump [[H1277]] and ripe, [[H2896]] came up [[H5927]] on one [[H259]] stalk. [[H7070]] 
6 After them, [[H310]] seven other [[H7651]] heads of grain [[H7641]] sprouted, [[H6779]] thin [[H1851]] and scorched [[H7710]] by the east wind. [[H6921]] 
7 And the thin [[H1851]] heads of grain [[H7641]] swallowed up [[H1104]] the seven [[H7651]] plump, [[H1277]] ripe [[H4392]] ones. [[H7641]] Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] awoke [[H3364]] and realized [[H2009]] it was a dream. [[H2472]] 
8 In the morning [[H1242]] his spirit [[H7307]] was troubled, [[H6470]] so he summoned [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] the magicians [[H2748]] and [[H3605]] wise men [[H2450]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] told [[H5608]] them his dreams, [[H2472]] but no one [[H369]] could interpret [[H6622]] them [[H853]] for him. [[H6547]] 
9 Then the chief [[H8269]] cupbearer [[H4945]] said [[H1696]] to [[H854]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] “Today [[H3117]] I [[H589]] recall [[H2142]] my failures. [[H2399]] 
10 Pharaoh [[H6547]] was once angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] his servants, [[H5650]] and he put [[H5414]] me [[H853]] and [[H853]] the chief [[H8269]] baker [[H644]] in the custody [[H4929]] of the captain [[H8269]] of the guard. [[H2876]] 
11 One [[H259]] night [[H3915]] both [the chief baker] [[H1931]] and I [[H589]] had dreams, [[H2492]] [and] each [[H376]] dream [[H2472]] had its own meaning. [[H6623]] 
12 Now a young [[H5288]] Hebrew [[H5680]] was there [[H8033]] with us, [[H854]] a servant [[H5650]] of the captain [[H8269]] of the guard. [[H2876]] We told [[H5608]] him [our dreams]  and he interpreted [[H6622]] [them] [[H2472]] for  us [[H853]] individually. [[H582]] 
13 And it happened [[H1961]] to us  just as [[H834]] he had interpreted: [[H6622]] I was restored [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] my position, [[H3653]] and the other man was hanged.” [[H8518]] 
14 So Pharaoh [[H6547]] sent for [[H7971]] Joseph, [[H3130]] who was quickly brought [[H7323]] out of [[H4480]] the dungeon. [[H953]] After he had shaved [[H1548]] and changed [[H2498]] his clothes, [[H8071]] he went in [[H935]] before [[H413]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]] 
15 Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “I had a dream, [[H2472]] and no [[H369]] one can interpret it. [[H6622]] But I [[H589]] have received word [[H8085]] about you [[H5921]] that when you hear [[H8085]] a dream [[H2472]] you can interpret it.” [[H6622]] 
16 “I myself cannot do it,” [[H1107]] Joseph [[H3130]] replied, [[H6030]] “but God [[H430]] will give Pharaoh [[H6547]] a favorable [[H7965]] answer.” [[H6030]] 
17 Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Joseph: [[H3130]] “In my dream [[H2472]] I was standing [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the bank [[H8193]] of the Nile, [[H2975]] 
18 when seven [[H7651]] cows, [[H6510]] well-fed [[H1277]] and sleek, [[H3303]] came up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the river [[H2975]] and began to graze [[H7462]] among the reeds. [[H260]] 
19 After them, [[H310]] seven [[H7651]] other [[H312]] cows, [[H6510]] sickly, [[H7451]] ugly, [[H8389]] and thin, [[H7534]] came up. [[H5927]] I have never [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] such ugly [[H7455]] [cows] [[H2007]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt! [[H4714]] 
20 Then the thin, [[H7534]] ugly [[H7451]] cows [[H6510]] devoured [[H398]] the seven [[H7651]] well-fed [[H1277]] cows [[H6510]] that were there first. [[H7223]] 
21 When they had devoured [[H935]] them, however, [[H7130]] no one could [[H3808]] tell [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] they had [done so]; [[H935]] their appearance [[H4758]] was as ugly [[H7451]] as [[H834]] it had been before. [[H8462]] Then I awoke. [[H3364]] 
22 In my dream [[H2472]] I also saw [[H7200]] seven [[H7651]] heads of grain, [[H7641]] plump [[H4392]] and ripe, [[H2896]] growing on [[H5927]] a single [[H259]] stalk. [[H7070]] 
23 After them, [[H310]] seven other [[H7651]] heads of grain [[H7641]] sprouted— [[H6779]] withered, [[H6798]] thin, [[H1851]] and scorched [[H7710]] by the east wind. [[H6921]] 
24 And the thin [[H1851]] heads of grain [[H7641]] swallowed [[H1104]] the seven [[H7651]] plump [[H2896]] ones. [[H7641]] I told [[H559]] this [dream] to [[H413]] the magicians, [[H2748]] but no [[H369]] one could explain it [[H5046]] to me.”  
25 Then Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] “The dreams [[H2472]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] are one and the same. [[H259]] God [[H430]] has revealed [[H5046]] to Pharaoh [[H6547]] what [[H834]] He is about to do. [[H6213]] 
26 The seven [[H7651]] good [[H2896]] cows [[H6510]] are seven [[H7651]] years, [[H8141]] and the seven [[H7651]] ripe [[H2896]] heads of grain [[H7641]] are seven [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]] The dreams [[H2472]] have the same meaning. [[H259]] 
27 Moreover, the seven [[H7651]] thin, [[H7534]] ugly [[H7451]] cows [[H6510]] that came up [[H5927]] after them [[H310]] are seven [[H7651]] years, [[H8141]] and so are [[H2007]] the seven [[H7651]] worthless [[H7386]] heads of grain [[H7641]] scorched [[H7710]] by the east wind— [[H6921]] they are [[H1961]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of famine. [[H7458]] 
28 It [[H1931]] is just as [[H834]] I said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] God [[H430]] has shown [[H7200]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] what [[H834]] He is about to do. [[H6213]] 
29 Behold, [[H2009]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of great [[H1419]] abundance [[H7647]] are coming [[H935]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] 
30 but seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of famine [[H7458]] will follow [[H6965]] them. [[H310]] Then all [[H3605]] the abundance [[H7647]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will be forgotten [[H7911]] and the famine [[H7458]] will devastate [[H3615]] the land. [[H776]] 
31 The abundance [[H7647]] in the land [[H776]] will not [[H3808]] be remembered, [[H3045]] since [[H6440]] the [[H1931]] famine [[H7458]] that follows [[H310]] it [[H3651]] [will be] so [[H3966]] severe. [[H3515]] 
32 Moreover, on [[H5921]] the basis of [[H3588]] the dream [[H2472]] being given [[H6471]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] in two versions, [[H8138]] the matter [[H1697]] has been decreed [[H3559]] by [[H5973]] God, [[H430]] and He [[H430]] will carry it out [[H6213]] shortly. [[H4116]] 
33 Now therefore, [[H6258]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] should look for [[H7200]] a discerning [[H995]] and wise [[H2450]] man [[H376]] and set [[H7896]] him over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
34 Let Pharaoh [[H6547]] take action [[H6213]] and appoint [[H6485]] commissioners [[H6496]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] to take a fifth [[H2567]] of [its] harvest [[H776]] during the seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of abundance. [[H7647]] 
35 Under [[H8478]] the authority [[H3027]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] let them collect [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the excess food [[H400]] from these [[H428]] good [[H2896]] years, [[H8141]] that they may come [[H935]] and lay up [[H6651]] the grain [[H1250]] to be preserved [[H8104]] as food [[H400]] in the cities. [[H5892]] 
36 This food [[H400]] will be [[H1961]] a reserve [[H6487]] for the land [[H776]] during the seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of famine [[H7458]] to come [[H1961]] upon the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] Then the country [[H776]] will not [[H3808]] perish [[H3772]] in the famine.” [[H7458]] 
37 This proposal [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his officials. [[H5650]] 
38 So Pharaoh [[H6547]] asked [[H559]] [them], [[H5650]] “Can we find [[H4672]] anyone like this [[H2088]] man, [[H376]] in  whom [[H834]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [abides]?” [[H430]] 
39 Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “Since [[H310]] God [[H430]] has made all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] known to you, [[H3045]] there is no one [[H369]] as discerning [[H995]] and wise [[H2450]] as you. [[H3644]] 
40 You [[H859]] shall be [[H1961]] in charge of [[H5921]] my house, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] my people [[H5971]] are to obey [[H5401]] your commands. [[H6310]] Only [[H7535]] with regard to the throne [[H3678]] will I be greater [[H1431]] than you.” [[H4480]] 
41 Pharaoh [[H6547]] also told [[H559]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “I hereby place [[H5414]] you over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt.” [[H4714]] 
42 Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] removed [[H5493]] the signet ring [[H2885]] from [[H5921]] his finger, [[H3027]] put [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] Joseph’s [[H3130]] finger, [[H3027]] clothed [[H3847]] him [[H853]] in garments [[H899]] of fine linen, [[H8336]] and placed [[H7760]] a gold [[H2091]] chain [[H7242]] around [[H5921]] his neck. [[H6677]] 
43 He had Joseph ride [[H7392]] in his second [[H4932]] chariot, [[H4818]] with men calling out [[H7121]] before him, [[H6440]] “Bow the knee!” [[H86]] So he placed [[H5414]] him over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
44 And Pharaoh [[H6547]] declared [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “I [[H589]] am Pharaoh, [[H6547]] but without your permission, [[H1107]] no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall lift [[H7311]] his hand [[H3027]] or [[H853]] foot.” [[H7272]] 
45 Pharaoh [[H6547]] gave [[H7121]] Joseph [[H3130]] the name [[H8034]] Zaphenath-Paneah, [[H6847]] and he gave [[H5414]] him  Asenath [[H621]] daughter [[H1323]] of Potiphera, [[H6319]] priest [[H3548]] of On, [[H204]] to be his wife. [[H802]] And Joseph [[H3130]] took charge [[H3318]] over [[H5921]] [all] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
46 Now Joseph [[H3130]] was thirty [[H7970]] years old [[H1121]] when he entered the service [[H5975]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] And Joseph [[H3130]] left [[H3318]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] presence [[H6440]] and traveled [[H5674]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
47 During the seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of abundance, [[H7647]] the land [[H776]] brought forth [[H6213]] bountifully. [[H7062]] 
48 During those seven [[H7651]] years, [[H8141]] Joseph collected [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the excess food [[H400]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and stored [[H5414]] it [[H400]] in the cities. [[H5892]] In [[H8432]] every city [[H5892]] he laid up [[H5414]] the food [[H400]] from the fields [[H7704]] around it. [[H5439]] 
49 So Joseph [[H3130]] stored up [[H6651]] grain [[H1250]] in such abundance, [[H7235]] like the sand [[H2344]] of the sea, [[H3220]] that [[H3588]] he stopped [[H2308]] keeping track of it; [[H5608]] for [[H3588]] it was beyond [[H369]] measure. [[H4557]] 
50 Before [[H2962]] the years [[H8141]] of famine [[H7458]] arrived, [[H935]] two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] were born [[H3205]] to Joseph [[H3130]] by Asenath [[H621]] daughter [[H1323]] of Potiphera, [[H6319]] priest [[H3548]] of On. [[H204]] 
51 Joseph [[H3130]] named [[H7121]] the firstborn [[H1060]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] saying, [[H3588]] “God [[H430]] has made me forget [[H5382]] all [[H3605]] my hardship [[H5999]] and all [[H3605]] my father’s [[H1]] household.” [[H1004]] 
52 And the second [son] [[H8145]] he named [[H8034]] Ephraim, [[H669]] saying, [[H3588]] “God [[H430]] has made me fruitful [[H6509]] in the land [[H776]] of my affliction.” [[H6040]] 
53 When the seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of abundance [[H7647]] in Egypt [[H4714]] came to an end, [[H3615]] 
54 the seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of famine [[H7458]] began, [[H2490]] just as [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] had said. [[H559]] And although there was [[H1961]] famine [[H7458]] in every [[H3605]] country, [[H776]] there was [[H1961]] food [[H3899]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
55 When extreme hunger [[H7456]] came to all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and the people [[H5971]] cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] for food, [[H3899]] [he] [[H6547]] told [[H559]] all [[H3605]] the Egyptians, [[H4713]] “Go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Joseph [[H3130]] and do [[H6213]] whatever [[H834]] he tells [[H559]] you.”  
56 When the famine [[H7458]] had spread [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the [[H6440]] land, [[H776]] Joseph [[H3130]] opened up [[H6605]] all [[H3605]] the storehouses and sold grain [[H7666]] to the Egyptians; [[H4713]] for the famine [[H7458]] was severe [[H2388]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
57 And every [[H3605]] nation [[H776]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Joseph [[H3130]] in Egypt [[H4714]] to buy grain, [[H7666]] because [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] was severe [[H2388]] over all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]
