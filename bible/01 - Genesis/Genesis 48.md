1 Some time later, [[H310]] Joseph [[H3130]] was told, [[H559]] “Your father [[H1]] is ill.” [[H2470]] So he set out [[H3947]] with [[H5973]] his two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] Manasseh [[H4519]] and Ephraim. [[H669]] 
2 When Jacob [[H3290]] was told, [[H5046]] “Your son [[H1121]] Joseph [[H3130]] has come [[H935]] to you,” [[H413]] Israel [[H3478]] rallied his strength [[H2388]] and sat up [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] bed. [[H4296]] 
3 Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “God [[H410]] Almighty [[H7706]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] me at Luz [[H3870]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and there He blessed [[H1288]] me [[H853]] 
4 and told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I will make you fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply you; [[H7235]] I will make you [[H5414]] a multitude [[H6951]] of peoples, [[H5971]] and will give [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to your descendants [[H2233]] after you [[H310]] as an everlasting [[H5769]] possession.’ [[H272]] 
5 And now [[H6258]] your two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] born [[H3205]] to you  in Egypt [[H4714]] before [[H5704]] I came [[H935]] to you [[H413]] [here] [[H4714]] [shall be reckoned as] [[H1992]] mine;  Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] shall be [[H1961]] mine,  just as Reuben [[H7205]] and Simeon [are mine]. [[H8095]] 
6 Any children [[H4138]] born [[H3205]] to you  after them [[H310]] shall be yours, [[H1961]] and they shall be called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] the names [[H8034]] of their brothers [[H251]] in the territory they inherit. [[H5159]] 
7 Now as for me, [[H589]] when I was returning [[H935]] from Paddan, [[H6307]] to my sorrow [[H5921]] Rachel [[H7354]] died [[H4191]] along the way [[H1870]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] some distance [[H3530]] from Ephrath. [[H672]] So I buried [[H6912]] her there [[H8033]] beside the road [[H1870]] to Ephrath” [[H672]] (that [[H1931]] [is],  Bethlehem). [[H1035]] 
8 When Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] the sons [[H1121]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] he asked, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] are these?” [[H428]] 
9 Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] “They [[H1992]] are the sons [[H1121]] God [[H430]] has given [[H5414]] me  in this [place].” [[H2088]] So Jacob said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] bring them [[H3947]] to me, [[H413]] that I may bless [them].” [[H1288]] 
10 Now Israel’s [[H3478]] eyesight [[H5869]] was poor [[H3513]] because of old age; [[H2207]] he could [[H3201]] hardly [[H3808]] see. [[H7200]] Joseph brought [[H5066]] [his sons] to him, [[H413]] and [his father] kissed [[H5401]] them  and embraced [[H2263]] them.  
11 “I never [[H3808]] expected [[H6419]] to see [[H7200]] your face again,” [[H6440]] Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “but now [[H2009]] God [[H430]] has let me see [[H7200]] your children [[H2233]] as well.” [[H1571]] 
12 Then Joseph [[H3130]] took [[H3318]] them from [[H5973]] his father’s knees [[H1290]] and bowed down [[H7812]] with his face [[H639]] to the ground. [[H776]] 
13 And Joseph [[H3130]] took [[H3947]] both [[H8147]] of them— [[H853]] with Ephraim [[H669]] in his right hand [[H3225]] toward Israel’s [[H3478]] left hand, [[H8040]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] in his left hand [[H8040]] toward Israel’s [[H3478]] right hand— [[H3225]] and brought them close [[H5066]] to him. [[H413]] 
14 But Israel [[H3478]] stretched out [[H7971]] his right hand [[H3225]] and put [[H7896]] it on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] the younger; [[H6810]] and crossing [[H7919]] his hands, [[H3027]] he put his left [[H8040]] on [[H5921]] Manasseh’s [[H4519]] head, [[H7218]] although [[H3588]] Manasseh [[H4519]] was the firstborn. [[H1060]] 
15 Then he blessed [[H1288]] Joseph [[H3130]] and said: [[H559]] “May the God [[H430]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] my fathers [[H1]] Abraham [[H85]] and Isaac [[H3327]] walked, [[H1980]] the God [[H430]] who has been my shepherd [[H7462]] all my life [[H5750]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] 
16 the Angel [[H4397]] who has redeemed [[H1350]] me [[H853]] from all [[H3605]] harm— [[H7451]] may He bless [[H1288]] these boys. [[H5288]] And may they be called [[H7121]] by my name [[H8034]] and the names [[H8034]] of my fathers [[H1]] Abraham [[H85]] and Isaac, [[H3327]] and may they grow [[H1711]] into a multitude [[H7230]] upon [[H7130]] the earth.” [[H776]] 
17 When Joseph [[H3130]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] his father [[H1]] had placed [[H7896]] his right [[H3225]] hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] Ephraim’s [[H669]] head, [[H7218]] he was displeased [[H7489]] and took [[H8551]] his father’s [[H1]] hand [[H3027]] to move [[H5493]] it [[H853]] from [[H5921]] Ephraim’s [[H669]] head [[H7218]] to [[H5921]] Manasseh’s. [[H4519]] 
18 “Not [[H3808]] so, [[H3651]] my father!” [[H1]] Joseph [[H3130]] said. [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] one is the firstborn; [[H1060]] put [[H7760]] your right hand [[H3225]] on [[H5921]] his head.” [[H7218]] 
19 But his father [[H1]] refused. [[H3985]] “I know, [[H3045]] my son, [[H1121]] I know!” [[H3045]] he said. [[H559]] “He [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] shall become [[H1961]] a people, [[H5971]] and he [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] shall be great; [[H1431]] nevertheless, [[H199]] his younger [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] shall be greater [[H1431]] than he, [[H4480]] and his offspring [[H2233]] shall become [[H1961]] a multitude [[H4393]] of nations.” [[H1471]] 
20 So that day [[H3117]] [Jacob] blessed [[H1288]] them [[H1931]] and said: [[H559]] “By you  shall Israel [[H3478]] pronounce [[H559]] this blessing: [[H1288]] ‘May God [[H430]] make [[H7760]] you like Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh.’” [[H4519]] So he put [[H7760]] Ephraim [[H669]] before [[H6440]] Manasseh. [[H4519]] 
21 Then Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “Look, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] am about to die, [[H4191]] but God [[H430]] will be [[H1961]] with you [[H5973]] and bring [[H7725]] you [[H853]] back to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of your fathers. [[H1]] 
22 And to you,  as one who is above [[H5921]] your brothers, [[H251]] I [[H589]] give [[H5414]] the [[H259]] ridge of land [[H7926]] that [[H834]] I took [[H3947]] from [[H3027]] the Amorites [[H567]] with my sword [[H2719]] and bow.” [[H7198]]
