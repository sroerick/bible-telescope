1 In those days [[H3117]] Amraphel [[H569]] king [[H4428]] of Shinar, [[H8152]] Arioch [[H746]] king [[H4428]] of Ellasar, [[H495]] Chedorlaomer [[H3540]] king [[H4428]] of Elam, [[H5867]] and Tidal [[H8413]] king [[H4428]] of Goiim [[H1471]] 
2 went to [[H6213]] war [[H4421]] against [[H854]] Bera [[H1298]] king [[H4428]] of Sodom, [[H5467]] Birsha [[H1306]] king [[H4428]] of Gomorrah, [[H6017]] Shinab [[H8134]] king [[H4428]] of Admah, [[H126]] Shemeber [[H8038]] king [[H4428]] of Zeboiim, [[H6636]] and the king [[H4428]] of Bela [[H1106]] (that is, [[H1931]] Zoar). [[H6820]] 
3 The latter [[H428]] [five] [[H3605]] came as allies [[H2266]] to [[H413]] the Valley [[H6010]] of Siddim [[H7708]] (that is, [[H1931]] the Salt [[H4417]] Sea). [[H3220]] 
4 For twelve [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] they had been subject [[H5647]] to Chedorlaomer, [[H3540]] but in the thirteenth [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] they rebelled. [[H4775]] 
5 In the fourteenth [[H702]] year, [[H8141]] Chedorlaomer [[H3540]] and the kings [[H4428]] who were [[H834]] allied with him [[H854]] went out [[H935]] and defeated [[H5221]] the Rephaites [[H7497]] in Ashteroth-karnaim, [[H6255]] the Zuzites [[H2104]] in Ham, [[H1990]] the Emites [[H368]] in Shaveh-kiriathaim, [[H7740]] 
6 and the Horites [[H2752]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Seir, [[H8165]] as [[H5704]] far as El-paran, [[H364]] which [is] [[H834]] near [[H5921]] the desert. [[H4057]] 
7 Then they turned back [[H7725]] to invade [[H935]] En-mishpat [[H5880]] (that is, [[H1931]] Kadesh), [[H6946]] and they conquered [[H5221]] the whole [[H3605]] territory [[H7704]] of the Amalekites, [[H6003]] as [[H1571]] well as the Amorites [[H567]] who lived [[H3427]] in Hazazon-tamar. [[H2688]] 
8 Then the king [[H4428]] of Sodom, [[H5467]] the king [[H4428]] of Gomorrah, [[H6017]] the king [[H4428]] of Admah, [[H126]] the king [[H4428]] of Zeboiim, [[H6636]] and the king [[H4428]] of Bela [[H1106]] (that is, [[H1931]] Zoar) [[H6820]] marched out [[H3318]] and arrayed [[H6186]] for battle [[H4421]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Siddim [[H7708]] 
9 against [[H854]] Chedorlaomer [[H3540]] king [[H4428]] of Elam, [[H5867]] Tidal [[H8413]] king [[H4428]] of Goiim, [[H1471]] Amraphel [[H569]] king [[H4428]] of Shinar, [[H8152]] and Arioch [[H746]] king [[H4428]] of Ellasar— [[H495]] four [[H702]] kings [[H4428]] against [[H854]] five. [[H2568]] 
10 Now the Valley [[H6010]] of Siddim [[H7708]] was full of tar [[H2564]] pits, [[H875]] and as the kings [[H4428]] of Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah [[H6017]] fled, [[H5127]] some men fell [[H5307]] into [the pits], [[H8033]] but the survivors [[H7604]] fled [[H5127]] to the hill country. [[H2022]] 
11 The [four kings] seized [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the goods [[H7399]] of Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah [[H6017]] and all [[H3605]] their food, [[H400]] and they went on their way. [[H1980]] 
12 They also carried off [[H3947]] Abram’s [[H87]] nephew [[H1121]] Lot [[H3876]] and his possessions, [[H7399]] since he [[H1931]] was living [[H3427]] in Sodom. [[H5467]] 
13 Then an escapee [[H6412]] came [[H935]] and reported [this] [[H5046]] to Abram [[H87]] the Hebrew. [[H5680]] Now [Abram] [[H1931]] was living [[H7931]] near the oaks [[H436]] of Mamre [[H4471]] the Amorite, [[H567]] a brother [[H251]] of Eshcol [[H812]] [and] [[H251]] Aner, [[H6063]] all of whom [[H1992]] were bound [[H1167]] by treaty [[H1285]] to Abram. [[H87]] 
14 And when Abram [[H87]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] his relative [[H251]] had been captured, [[H7617]] he assembled [[H7324]] the 318 [[H8083]] trained men [[H2593]] born [[H3211]] in his household, [[H1004]] and they set out in pursuit [[H7291]] as [[H5704]] far as Dan. [[H1835]] 
15 During the night, [[H3915]] [Abram] [[H1931]] divided [[H2505]] his forces [[H5650]] and routed [Chedorlaomer’s army], [[H5221]] pursuing [[H7291]] them as [[H5704]] far as Hobah, [[H2327]] north [[H8040]] of Damascus. [[H1834]] 
16 He retrieved [[H7725]] all [[H3605]] the goods, [[H7399]] as well as [[H1571]] his relative [[H251]] Lot [[H3876]] and his possessions, [[H7399]] together with [[H1571]] the women [[H802]] and the rest of the people. [[H5971]] 
17 After [[H310]] Abram returned [[H7725]] from defeating [[H5221]] Chedorlaomer [[H3540]] and the kings [[H4428]] allied with him, [[H854]] the king [[H4428]] of Sodom [[H5467]] went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] him in [[H413]] the Valley [[H6010]] of Shaveh [[H7740]] (that is, [[H1931]] the King’s [[H4428]] Valley). [[H6010]] 
18 Then Melchizedek [[H4442]] king [[H4428]] of Salem [[H8004]] brought out [[H3318]] bread [[H3899]] and wine— [[H3196]] since he [[H1931]] was priest [[H3548]] of God [[H410]] Most High— [[H5945]] 
19 and he blessed [Abram] [[H1288]] and said: [[H559]] “Blessed be [[H1288]] Abram [[H87]] by God [[H410]] Most High, [[H5945]] Creator [[H7069]] of heaven [[H8064]] and earth, [[H776]] 
20 and blessed be [[H1288]] God [[H410]] Most High, [[H5945]] who [[H834]] has delivered [[H4042]] your enemies [[H6862]] into your hand.” [[H3027]] Then Abram gave [[H5414]] [Melchizedek] a tenth [[H4643]] of everything. [[H3605]] 
21 The king [[H4428]] of Sodom [[H5467]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] “Give [[H5414]] me the people, [[H5315]] but take [[H3947]] the goods for yourself.” [[H7399]] 
22 But Abram [[H87]] replied [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Sodom, [[H5467]] “I have raised [[H7311]] my hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H410]] Most High, [[H5945]] Creator [[H7069]] of heaven [[H8064]] and earth, [[H776]] 
23 that [[H518]] I will not [[H518]] accept [[H3947]] even [[H5704]] a thread, [[H2339]] or a strap [[H8288]] of a sandal, [[H5275]] or anything [[H3605]] that belongs to you, [[H834]] lest [[H3808]] you should say, [[H559]] ‘I {have made} [[H589]] Abram [[H87]] rich.’ [[H6238]] 
24 I will accept nothing [[H1107]] but [[H7535]] what [[H834]] my men [[H5288]] have eaten [[H398]] and the share [[H2506]] for the men [[H376]] who [[H834]] went [[H1980]] with me— [[H854]] Aner, [[H6063]] Eshcol, [[H812]] and Mamre. [[H4471]] They [[H1992]] may take [[H3947]] their portion.” [[H2506]]
