[[Genesis 45|←]] • [[Genesis 47|→]]
1 So Israel [[H3478]] set out [[H5265]] with all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had,  and when he came [[H935]] to  Beersheba, [[H884]] he offered [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] to the God [[H430]] of his father [[H1]] Isaac. [[H3327]] 
2 And that night [[H3915]] God [[H430]] spoke [[H559]] to Israel [[H3478]] in a vision: [[H4759]] “Jacob, [[H3290]] Jacob!” [[H3290]] He said. [[H559]] “Here I am,” [[H2009]] replied Jacob. [[H559]] 
3 “I [[H595]] am God,” [[H410]] He said, [[H559]] “the God [[H430]] of your father. [[H1]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] to go down [[H3381]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] I will make [[H7760]] you into a great [[H1419]] nation [[H1471]] there. [[H8033]] 
4 I [[H595]] will go down [[H3381]] with [[H5973]] you to Egypt, [[H4714]] and I [[H595]] will surely [[H1571]] bring you back. [[H5927]] And Joseph’s [[H3130]] own hands [[H3027]] will close [[H7896]] your eyes.” [[H5869]] 
5 Then Jacob [[H3290]] departed [[H6965]] from  Beersheba, [[H884]] and the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] took [[H5375]] their father [[H1]] Jacob [[H3290]] in the wagons [[H5699]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] had sent [[H7971]] to carry him, [[H5375]] along with their children [[H2945]] and wives. [[H802]] 
6 They also took [[H3947]] their livestock [[H4735]] and the possessions [[H7399]] they had acquired [[H7408]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and Jacob [[H3290]] and all [[H3605]] his offspring [[H2233]] went [[H935]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] 
7 He took [[H935]] with him [[H854]] to Egypt [[H4714]] his sons [[H1121]] and grandsons, [[H1121]] [and] his daughters [[H1323]] and granddaughters— [[H1323]] all [[H3605]] his offspring. [[H2233]] 
8 Now these [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] (Jacob [[H3290]] and his descendants) [[H1121]] who went [[H935]] to Egypt: [[H4714]] Reuben, [[H7205]] Jacob’s [[H3290]] firstborn. [[H1060]]

18 These [[H428]] are the sons [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] born [[H3205]] to Zilpah— [[H2153]] whom [[H834]] Laban [[H3837]] gave [[H5414]] to his daughter [[H1323]] Leah— [[H3812]] sixteen [[H8337]] in all. [[H5315]] 
19 The sons [[H1121]] of Jacob’s [[H3290]] wife [[H802]] Rachel: [[H7354]] Joseph [[H3130]] and Benjamin. [[H1144]] 
20 Manasseh [[H4519]] and Ephraim [[H669]] were born [[H3205]] to Joseph [[H3130]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] by Asenath [[H621]] daughter [[H1323]] of Potiphera, [[H6319]] priest [[H3548]] of On. [[H204]]

22 These [[H428]] are the sons [[H1121]] of Rachel [[H7354]] born [[H3205]] to Jacob— [[H3290]] fourteen [[H702]] in all. [[H5315]]

25 These [[H428]] are the sons [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] born [[H3205]] to Bilhah, [[H1090]] whom [[H834]] Laban [[H3837]] gave [[H5414]] to his daughter [[H1323]] Rachel— [[H7354]] seven [[H7651]] in all. [[H5315]] 
26 All those [[H3605]] belonging to Jacob [[H3290]] who came [[H935]] to Egypt— [[H4714]] his direct descendants, [[H3318]] besides [[H905]] the wives [[H802]] of Jacob’s [[H3290]] sons— [[H1121]] [numbered] sixty-six [[H8346]] persons. [[H5315]] 
27 And along with Joseph’s [[H3130]] two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] who [[H834]] were born [[H3205]] to him  in Egypt, [[H4714]] in all [[H3605]] there were [[H935]] seventy [[H7657]] members [[H5315]] of Jacob’s [[H3290]] household [[H1004]] in Egypt. [[H4714]] 
28 Now Jacob had sent [[H7971]] Judah [[H3063]] ahead of [[H6440]] him to [[H413]] Joseph [[H3130]] to get directions [[H3384]] to Goshen. [[H1657]] When [Jacob’s family] arrived [[H935]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] 
29 Joseph [[H3130]] prepared [[H631]] his chariot [[H4818]] and went [[H5927]] [there] [[H1657]] to meet [[H7125]] his father [[H1]] Israel. [[H3478]] Joseph presented [[H7200]] himself to him, [[H413]] embraced [[H5307]] him, [[H6677]] and wept [[H1058]] profusely. [[H5750]] 
30 Then Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “Finally I can die, [[H4191]] now [[H6471]] that I have seen [[H7200]] your face [[H6440]] [and know] that [[H3588]] you are still [[H5750]] alive!” [[H2416]] 
31 Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his brothers [[H251]] and to [[H413]] his father’s [[H1]] household, [[H1004]] “I will go up [[H5927]] and inform [[H5046]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] ‘My brothers [[H251]] and my father’s [[H1]] household [[H1004]] from the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] have come [[H935]] to me. [[H413]] 
32 The men [[H582]] are shepherds; [[H7462]] they raise livestock, [[H4735]] and they have brought [[H935]] their flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they own.’  
33 When [[H3588]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] summons [[H7121]] you  and asks, [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] is your occupation?’ [[H4639]] 
34 you are to say, [[H559]] ‘Your servants [[H5650]] have raised livestock [[H4735]] ever since our youth— [[H5271]] both [[H1571]] we [[H587]] and [[H1571]] our fathers.’ [[H1]] Then [[H5668]] you will be allowed to settle [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] since [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] shepherds [[H7462]] are detestable [[H8441]] to the Egyptians.” [[H4713]]
