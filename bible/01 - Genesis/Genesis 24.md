# Genesis 24
[[Genesis 23|←]] • [[Genesis 25|→]]
1 By now Abraham [[H85]] was old [[H2204]] and well along [[H935]] in years, [[H3117]] and the LORD [[H3068]] had blessed [[H1288]] him [[H85]] in every way. [[H3605]] 
2 So Abraham [[H85]] instructed [[H559]] the chief [[H2205]] servant [[H5650]] of his household, [[H1004]] who managed [[H4910]] all he owned, [[H3605]] “Place [[H7760]] your hand [[H3027]] under [[H8478]] my thigh, [[H3409]] 
3 and I will have you swear [[H7650]] by the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of heaven [[H8064]] and the God [[H430]] of earth, [[H776]] that [[H834]] you will not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for my son [[H1121]] from the daughters [[H1323]] of the Canaanites [[H3669]] among [[H7130]] whom [[H834]] I [[H595]] am dwelling, [[H3427]] 
4 but [[H3588]] will go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] my country [[H776]] and [[H413]] my kindred [[H4138]] to take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for my son [[H1121]] Isaac.” [[H3327]] 
5 The servant [[H5650]] asked [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “What if [[H194]] the woman [[H802]] is unwilling [[H3808]] to follow [[H1980]] me to [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land? [[H776]] Shall I then take your son back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] from [[H8033]] which [[H834]] you came?” [[H3318]] 
6 Abraham [[H85]] replied, [[H559]] “Make sure [[H8104]] that you do not [[H6435]] take my son [[H1121]] back [[H7725]] there. [[H8033]] 
7 The LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]] who [[H834]] brought me [[H3947]] from my father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] and my native [[H4138]] land, [[H776]] who [[H834]] spoke [[H1696]] to me  and [[H834]] promised me on oath, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] ‘To your offspring [[H2233]] I will give [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] land’— [[H776]] He [[H1931]] will send [[H7971]] His angel [[H4397]] before you [[H6440]] so that you can take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for my son [[H1121]] from there. [[H8033]] 
8 And if [[H518]] the woman [[H802]] is unwilling [[H3808]] to follow [[H1980]] you, [[H310]] then you are released [[H5352]] from this [[H2063]] oath of mine. [[H7621]] Only [[H7535]] do not [[H3808]] take [[H7725]] my son [[H1121]] back there.” [[H8033]] 
9 So the servant [[H5650]] placed [[H7760]] his hand [[H3027]] under [[H8478]] his master [[H113]] Abraham’s [[H85]] thigh [[H3409]] and swore an oath [[H7650]] to him  concerning [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] matter. [[H1697]] 
10 Then the servant [[H5650]] took [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] of his master’s [[H113]] camels [[H1581]] and departed [[H1980]] with all manner [[H3605]] of good things [[H2898]] from his master [[H113]] in hand. [[H3027]] And he set out [[H6965]] for [[H413]] Nahor’s [[H5152]] hometown [[H5892]] in Mesopotamia. [[H763]] 
11 As evening approached, [[H6153]] he made the camels [[H1581]] kneel down [[H1288]] near [[H413]] the well [[H875]] outside [[H2351]] the town, [[H5892]] at the time [[H6256]] when the women went out [[H3318]] to draw water. [[H7579]] 
12 “O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of my master [[H113]] Abraham,” [[H85]] he prayed, [[H559]] “please [[H4994]] grant me success today, [[H7136]] and show [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] my master [[H113]] Abraham. [[H85]] 
13 Here [[H2009]] I am, [[H595]] standing [[H5324]] beside [[H5921]] the spring, [[H5869]] and the daughters [[H1323]] of the townspeople [[H376]] are coming out [[H3318]] to draw [[H7579]] water. [[H4325]] 
14 Now may it happen [[H1961]] that the girl [[H5291]] to [[H413]] whom [[H834]] I say, [[H559]] ‘Please [[H4994]] let down [[H5186]] your jar [[H3537]] that I may drink,’ [[H8354]] and who responds, [[H559]] ‘Drink, [[H8354]] and I will water [[H8248]] your camels [[H1581]] as well’— [[H1571]] let her be the one You have appointed [[H3198]] for Your servant [[H5650]] Isaac. [[H3327]] By this I will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] You have shown [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] my master. [[H113]] 
15 Before [[H2962]] he [[H1931]] had finished [[H3615]] praying, [[H1696]] Rebekah [[H7259]] came out [[H3318]] with her jar [[H3537]] on [[H5921]] her shoulder. [[H7926]] She [[H834]] was [[H3205]] the daughter of Bethuel [[H1328]] son [[H1121]] of Milcah, [[H4435]] the wife [[H802]] of Abraham’s [[H85]] brother [[H251]] Nahor. [[H5152]] 
16 Now the girl [[H5291]] was very [[H3966]] beautiful, [[H2896]] a virgin [[H1330]] who had not had relations [[H3045]] with any man. [[H376]] She went down [[H3381]] to the spring, [[H5869]] filled [[H4390]] her jar, [[H3537]] and came up again. [[H5927]] 
17 So the servant [[H5650]] ran [[H7323]] to meet her [[H7125]] and said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] let me have [[H1572]] a little [[H4592]] water [[H4325]] from your jar.” [[H3537]] 
18 “Drink, [[H8354]] my lord,” [[H113]] she replied, [[H559]] and she quickly [[H4116]] lowered [[H3381]] her jar [[H3537]] to [[H5921]] her hands [[H3027]] and gave him a drink. [[H8248]] 
19 After she [[H3615]] had given him a drink, [[H8248]] she said, [[H559]] “I will also [[H1571]] draw water [[H7579]] for your camels, [[H1581]] until [[H5704]] they have had enough [[H3615]] to drink.” [[H8354]] 
20 And she quickly [[H4116]] emptied [[H6168]] her jar [[H3537]] into [[H413]] the trough [[H8268]] and ran [[H7323]] back [[H5750]] to [[H413]] the well [[H875]] to draw water, [[H7579]] until she had drawn water [[H7579]] for all [[H3605]] his camels. [[H1581]] 
21 Meanwhile, the man [[H376]] watched her [[H7583]] silently [[H2790]] to see [[H3045]] whether [[H518]] or not [[H3808]] the LORD [[H3068]] had made his journey [[H1870]] a success. [[H6743]] 
22 And [[H1961]] after [[H834]] the camels [[H1581]] had finished [[H3615]] drinking, [[H8354]] [he] [[H376]] took out [[H3947]] a gold [[H2091]] ring [[H5141]] weighing [[H4948]] a beka, [[H1235]] and two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] bracelets [[H6781]] for [[H5921]] her wrists [[H3027]] weighing [[H4948]] ten [shekels]. [[H6235]] 
23 “Whose [[H4310]] daughter [[H1323]] are you?” [[H859]] he asked. [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] tell me, [[H5046]] is there [[H3426]] room [[H4725]] in your father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] for us to spend the night?” [[H3885]] 
24 She replied, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] am the daughter [[H1323]] of Bethuel, [[H1328]] the son [[H1121]] that Milcah [[H4435]] bore [[H3205]] to Nahor.” [[H5152]] 
25 Then she added, [[H559]] “We have [[H5973]] plenty [[H7227]] of straw [[H8401]] and [[H1571]] feed, [[H4554]] as well as [[H1571]] a place [for you] [[H4725]] to spend the night.” [[H3885]] 
26 Then the man [[H376]] bowed down [[H6915]] and worshiped [[H7812]] the LORD, [[H3068]] 
27 saying, [[H559]] “Blessed [[H1288]] [be] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of my master [[H113]] Abraham, [[H85]] who [[H834]] has not [[H3808]] withheld [[H5800]] His kindness [[H2617]] and faithfulness [[H571]] from [[H5973]] my master. [[H113]] As for me, [[H595]] the LORD [[H3068]] has led [[H5148]] me on the journey [[H1870]] to the house [[H1004]] of my master’s [[H113]] kinsmen. [[H251]] 
28 The girl [[H5291]] ran [[H7323]] and told [[H5046]] her mother’s [[H517]] household [[H1004]] about these [[H428]] things. [[H1697]] 
29 Now Rebekah [[H7259]] had a brother [[H251]] named [[H8034]] Laban, [[H3837]] and [he] [[H3837]] rushed [[H7323]] out [[H2351]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] at [[H413]] the spring. [[H5869]] 
30 As soon as he saw [[H7200]] the ring, [[H5141]] and [[H853]] the bracelets [[H6781]] on [[H5921]] his sister’s [[H269]] wrists, [[H3027]] and heard [[H8085]] Rebekah’s [[H7259]] words, [[H1697]] “The man [[H376]] said [[H1696]] this [[H3541]] to me,” [[H413]] he went and found [[H935]] the man [[H376]] standing [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the camels [[H1581]] near [[H5921]] the spring. [[H5869]] 
31 “Come, [[H935]] you who are blessed [[H1288]] by the LORD,” [[H3068]] said Laban. [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] are you standing [[H5975]] out here? [[H2351]] I [[H595]] have prepared [[H6437]] the house [[H1004]] and a place [[H4725]] for the camels.” [[H1581]] 
32 So the man [[H376]] came [[H935]] to the house, [[H1004]] and the camels [[H1581]] were unloaded. [[H6605]] Straw [[H8401]] and feed [[H4554]] were brought [[H5414]] to the camels, [[H1581]] and water [[H4325]] to wash [[H7364]] his feet [[H7272]] and the feet [[H7272]] of his companions. [[H582]] 
33 Then a meal was set [[H3455]] before [the man], [[H6440]] but he said, [[H559]] “I will not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] until [[H5704]] I have told you [[H1696]] what I came to say.” [[H1697]] So Laban said, [[H559]] “Please speak.” [[H1696]] 
34 “I [[H595]] am Abraham’s [[H85]] servant,” [[H5650]] he replied. [[H559]] 
35 “The LORD [[H3068]] has greatly [[H3966]] blessed [[H1288]] my master, [[H113]] and he has become rich. [[H1431]] He has given [[H5414]] him  sheep [[H6629]] and cattle, [[H1241]] silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H8198]] camels [[H1581]] and donkeys. [[H2543]] 
36 My master’s [[H113]] wife [[H802]] Sarah [[H8283]] has borne [[H3205]] [him] [[H113]] a son [[H1121]] in [[H310]] her old age, [[H2209]] and [my master] has given [[H5414]] him  everything he owns. [[H3605]] 
37 My master [[H113]] made me swear an oath [[H7650]] and said, [[H559]] ‘You shall not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for my son [[H1121]] from the daughters [[H1323]] of the Canaanites [[H3669]] in whose land [[H776]] I [[H595]] dwell, [[H3427]] 
38 but [[H518]] you shall go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] my father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] and to [[H413]] my kindred [[H4940]] to take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for my son.’ [[H1121]] 
39 Then I asked [[H559]] my master, [[H113]] ‘What if [[H194]] the woman [[H802]] will not [[H3808]] come [[H1980]] back with me?’ [[H310]] 
40 And he told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] ‘The LORD, [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] I have walked, [[H1980]] will send [[H7971]] His angel [[H4397]] with you [[H854]] and make your journey [[H1870]] a success, [[H6743]] so that you may take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for my son [[H1121]] from my kindred [[H4940]] and from my father’s [[H1]] house. [[H1004]] 
41 Then, [[H227]] when [[H3588]] you go [[H935]] to [[H413]] my kindred, [[H4940]] if [[H518]] they refuse to [[H3808]] give her [[H5414]] to you,  you will be [[H1961]] released [[H5355]] from my oath.’ [[H423]] 
42 So when I came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the spring [[H5869]] today, [[H3117]] I prayed, [[H559]] ‘O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of my master [[H113]] Abraham, [[H85]] if only [[H518]] You would [[H3426]] make my journey [[H1870]] a success! [[H6743]] 
43 Here [[H2009]] I am, [[H595]] standing [[H5324]] beside [[H5921]] this spring. [[H5869]] Now [if] [[H1961]] a maiden [[H5959]] comes out [[H3318]] to draw water [[H7579]] and I say [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] “Please [[H4994]] let me drink [[H8248]] a little [[H4592]] water [[H4325]] from your jar,” [[H3537]] 
44 and she replies, [[H559]] “Drink, [[H8354]] and I will draw water [[H7579]] for your camels [[H1581]] as well,” [[H1571]] may she [[H1931]] be the woman [[H802]] the LORD [[H3068]] has appointed [[H3198]] for my master’s [[H113]] son. [[H1121]] 
45 And before [[H2962]] I [[H589]] had finished [[H3615]] praying [[H1696]] in [[H413]] my heart, [[H3820]] there [[H2009]] was Rebekah [[H7259]] coming out [[H3318]] with her jar [[H3537]] on [[H5921]] her shoulder, [[H7926]] and she went down [[H3381]] to the spring [[H5869]] and drew water. [[H7579]] So I said [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] ‘Please [[H4994]] give me a drink.’ [[H8248]] 
46 She quickly [[H4116]] lowered [[H3381]] her jar [[H3537]] from her [shoulder] [[H5921]] and said, [[H559]] ‘Drink, [[H8354]] and I will water [[H8248]] your camels [[H1581]] as well.’ [[H1571]] So I drank, [[H8354]] and she also [[H1571]] watered [[H8248]] the camels. [[H1581]] 
47 Then I asked her, [[H7592]] ‘Whose [[H4310]] daughter [[H1323]] are you?’ [[H859]] She replied, [[H559]] ‘The daughter [[H1323]] of Bethuel [[H1328]] son [[H1121]] of Nahor, [[H5152]] whom [[H834]] Milcah [[H4435]] bore [[H3205]] to him.’  So I put [[H7760]] the ring [[H5141]] on [[H5921]] her nose [[H639]] and the bracelets [[H6781]] on [[H5921]] her wrists. [[H3027]] 
48 Then I bowed down [[H6915]] and worshiped [[H7812]] the LORD; [[H3068]] and I praised [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of my master [[H113]] Abraham, [[H85]] who [[H834]] led [[H5148]] me on the right [[H571]] road [[H1870]] to take [[H3947]] the granddaughter [[H1323]] of my master’s [[H113]] brother [[H251]] for his son. [[H1121]] 
49 Now [[H6258]] if [[H518]] you will [[H3426]] show [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] and faithfulness [[H571]] to [[H854]] my master, [[H113]] tell [[H5046]] me;  but if [[H518]] not, [[H3808]] let me know, [[H5046]] so that I may go [[H6437]] elsewhere.” [[H5921]] 
50 Laban [[H3837]] and Bethuel [[H1328]] answered, [[H6030]] “This is from [[H3318]] the LORD; [[H3068]] we have no [[H3808]] choice in the matter. [[H1697]] 
51 Rebekah [[H7259]] is here [[H2009]] before you. [[H6440]] Take [[H3947]] her and go, [[H1980]] and let her become [[H1961]] the wife [[H802]] of your master’s [[H113]] son, [[H1121]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has decreed.” [[H1696]] 
52 When [[H834]] Abraham’s [[H85]] servant [[H5650]] heard [[H8085]] their words, [[H1697]] he bowed down [[H7812]] to the ground [[H776]] before the LORD. [[H3068]] 
53 Then he [[H5650]] brought out [[H3318]] jewels [[H3627]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] and articles of clothing, [[H899]] and gave [[H5414]] them to Rebekah. [[H7259]] He also gave [[H5414]] precious gifts [[H4030]] to her brother [[H251]] and her mother. [[H517]] 
54 Then he [[H1931]] and the men [[H376]] with [[H5973]] him ate [[H398]] and drank [[H8354]] and spent the night there. [[H3885]] When they got up [[H6965]] the next morning, [[H1242]] he said, [[H559]] “Send me on my way [[H7971]] to my master.” [[H113]] 
55 But her brother [[H251]] and mother [[H517]] said, [[H559]] “Let the girl [[H5291]] remain [[H3427]] with us [[H854]] ten [[H6218]] days [[H3117]] or so. [[H176]] After that, [[H310]] she may go.” [[H1980]] 
56 But he replied, [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] delay me, [[H309]] since the LORD [[H3068]] has made my journey [[H1870]] a success. [[H6743]] Send me on my way [[H7971]] so that I may go [[H1980]] to my master.” [[H113]] 
57 So they said, [[H559]] “We will call [[H7121]] the girl [[H5291]] and ask [[H7592]] her opinion.” [[H6310]] 
58 They called [[H7121]] Rebekah [[H7259]] and asked [[H559]] her, [[H413]] “Will you go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] this [[H2088]] man?” [[H376]] “I will go,” [[H1980]] she replied. [[H559]] 
59 So they sent [[H7971]] their sister [[H269]] Rebekah {on her way}, [[H7259]] along with her nurse [[H3243]] and Abraham’s [[H85]] servant [[H5650]] and his men. [[H376]] 
60 And they blessed [[H1288]] Rebekah [[H7259]] and said [[H559]] to her,  “Our sister, [[H269]] may you [[H859]] become the mother [[H1961]] of thousands [[H505]] upon thousands. [[H7233]] May your offspring [[H2233]] possess [[H3423]] the gates [[H8179]] of their enemies.” [[H8130]] 
61 Then Rebekah [[H7259]] and her servant girls [[H5291]] got ready, [[H6965]] mounted [[H7392]] the camels, [[H1581]] and followed [[H1980]] the man. [[H376]] So the servant [[H5650]] took [[H3947]] Rebekah [[H7259]] and left. [[H1980]] 
62 Now Isaac [[H3327]] had just returned [[H935]] from [[H935]] Beer-lahai-roi, [[H883]] for he [[H1931]] was living [[H3427]] in the Negev. [[H5045]] 
63 Early in the evening [[H6153]] Isaac [[H3327]] went out [[H3318]] to the field [[H7704]] to meditate, [[H7742]] and looking up, [[H5375]] he saw [[H7200]] the camels [[H1581]] approaching. [[H935]] 
64 Rebekah [[H7259]] lifted up [[H5375]] her [[H853]] eyes, [[H5869]] and when she saw [[H7200]] Isaac, [[H3327]] she got down [[H5307]] from [[H5921]] her camel [[H1581]] 
65 and asked [[H559]] the servant, [[H5650]] “Who [[H4310]] is that [[H1976]] man [[H376]] in the field [[H7704]] coming [[H1980]] to meet us?” [[H7125]] “It [[H1931]] is my master,” [[H113]] the servant [[H5650]] answered. [[H559]] So she took [[H3947]] her veil [[H6809]] and covered herself. [[H3680]] 
66 Then the servant [[H5650]] told [[H5608]] Isaac [[H3327]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had done. [[H6213]] 
67 And Isaac [[H3327]] brought [[H935]] her into the tent [[H168]] of his mother [[H517]] Sarah [[H8283]] and took [[H3947]] Rebekah [[H7259]] as [[H1961]] his wife. [[H802]] And Isaac [[H3327]] loved her [[H157]] and was comforted [[H5162]] after [[H310]] his mother’s death. [[H517]]
