# Genesis 38
[[Genesis 37|←]] • [[Genesis 39|→]]
1 About [[H1961]] that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] Judah [[H3063]] left [[H3381]] his brothers [[H251]] and settled [[H5186]] near [[H5704]] a man [[H376]] named [[H8034]] Hirah, [[H2437]] an Adullamite. [[H5726]] 
2 There [[H8033]] Judah [[H3063]] saw [[H7200]] the daughter [[H1323]] of a Canaanite [[H3669]] man [[H376]] named [[H8034]] Shua, [[H7770]] and he took her as a wife [[H3947]] and slept with [[H935]] her. [[H413]] 
3 So she conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and [Judah] named [[H7121]] him Er. [[H6147]] 
4 Again [[H5750]] she conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and she named [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Onan. [[H209]] 
5 Then she gave birth to [[H3205]] another [[H3254]] son [[H1121]] and named [[H7121]] him Shelah; [[H7956]] it was [[H1961]] at Chezib [[H3580]] that she gave birth to him. [[H3205]] 
6 Now Judah [[H3063]] acquired [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for Er, [[H6147]] his firstborn, [[H1060]] and her name [[H8034]] was Tamar. [[H8559]] 
7 But [[H1961]] Er, [[H6147]] Judah’s [[H3063]] firstborn, [[H1060]] was wicked [[H7451]] in the LORD’s [[H3068]] sight; [[H5869]] so the LORD [[H3068]] put him to death. [[H4191]] 
8 Then Judah [[H3063]] said [[H559]] to Onan, [[H209]] “Sleep with [[H935]] your brother’s [[H251]] wife. [[H802]] Perform your duty as her brother-in-law [[H2992]] and raise up [[H6965]] offspring [[H2233]] for your brother.” [[H251]] 
9 But Onan [[H209]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the offspring [[H2233]] would not [[H3808]] belong [[H1961]] to him;  so whenever [[H518]] he would sleep with [[H935]] his brother’s [[H251]] wife, [[H802]] he would spill his seed [[H7843]] on the ground [[H776]] so that he would not [[H1115]] produce [[H5414]] offspring [[H2233]] for his brother. [[H251]] 
10 What [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] was evil [[H7489]] in the LORD’s [[H3068]] sight, [[H5869]] so He put [Onan] to death [[H4191]] as well. [[H1571]] 
11 Then Judah [[H3063]] said [[H559]] to his daughter-in-law [[H3618]] Tamar, [[H8559]] “Live [[H3427]] as a widow [[H490]] in your father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] until [[H5704]] my son [[H1121]] Shelah [[H7956]] grows up.” [[H1431]] For [[H3588]] he thought, [[H559]] “He [[H1931]] may [[H6435]] die [[H4191]] too, [[H1571]] like his brothers.” [[H251]] So Tamar [[H8559]] went [[H1980]] to live [[H3427]] in her father’s [[H1]] house. [[H1004]] 
12 After a long [[H7235]] time [[H3117]] Judah’s [[H3063]] wife, [[H802]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Shua, [[H7770]] died. [[H4191]] When Judah [[H3063]] had finished mourning, [[H5162]] he [[H1931]] and his friend [[H7453]] Hirah [[H2437]] the Adullamite [[H5726]] went up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] his sheepshearers [[H1494]] at Timnah. [[H8553]] 
13 When Tamar [[H8559]] was told, [[H5046]] “Your father-in-law [[H2524]] is going up [[H5927]] to Timnah [[H8553]] to shear [[H1494]] his sheep,” [[H6629]] 
14 she removed [[H5493]] her widow’s [[H491]] garments, [[H899]] covered her face [[H5968]] with a veil [[H6809]] to disguise herself, [[H3680]] and sat [[H3427]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to Enaim, [[H5869]] which [[H834]] is on [[H5921]] the way [[H1870]] to Timnah. [[H8553]] For [[H3588]] she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] although Shelah [[H7956]] had grown up, [[H1431]] she [[H1931]] had not [[H3808]] been given [[H5414]] to him  as a wife. [[H802]] 
15 When Judah [[H3063]] saw her, [[H7200]] he thought [[H2803]] she was a prostitute [[H2181]] because [[H3588]] she had covered [[H3680]] her face. [[H6440]] 
16 Not [[H3808]] realizing [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] was his daughter-in-law, [[H3618]] he went over [[H5186]] to [[H413]] her and said, [[H559]] “Come [[H3051]] now, [[H4994]] let me sleep with [[H935]] you.” [[H413]] “What [[H4100]] will you give [[H5414]] me for [[H3588]] sleeping with [[H935]] you?” [[H413]] she asked. [[H559]] 
17 “I [[H595]] will send you [[H7971]] a young goat [[H1423]] from [[H4480]] my flock,” [[H6629]] [Judah] answered. [[H559]] But she replied, [[H559]] “Only if [[H518]] you leave me [[H5414]] something as a pledge [[H6162]] until [[H5704]] you send it.” [[H7971]] 
18 “What [[H4100]] pledge [[H6162]] should I give you?” [[H5414]] he asked. [[H559]] She answered, [[H559]] “Your seal [[H2368]] and your cord, [[H6616]] and the staff [[H4294]] in your hand.” [[H3027]] So he gave [[H5414]] them to her  and slept with [[H935]] her, [[H413]] and she became pregnant [[H2029]] by him.  
19 After she got up [[H6965]] and left, [[H1980]] she removed [[H5493]] her veil [[H6809]] and put on her widow’s [[H491]] garments [[H899]] again. [[H3847]] 
20 Now when Judah [[H3063]] sent [[H7971]] his friend [Hirah] [[H7453]] the Adullamite [[H5726]] with [[H3027]] the young goat [[H1423]] to collect [[H3947]] the items he had left with [[H6162]] the woman, [[H802]] he could not [[H3808]] find her. [[H4672]] 
21 He asked [[H7592]] the men [[H582]] of that place, [[H4725]] “Where [[H346]] is the temple prostitute [[H6948]] who [[H1931]] was beside [[H5921]] the road [[H1870]] at Enaim?” [[H5879]] “No [[H3808]] temple prostitute [[H6948]] has been [[H1961]] here,” [[H2088]] they answered. [[H559]] 
22 So [Hirah] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Judah [[H3063]] and said, [[H559]] “I could not [[H3808]] find her, [[H4672]] and furthermore, [[H1571]] the men [[H376]] of that place [[H4725]] said, [[H559]] ‘No [[H3808]] temple prostitute [[H6948]] has been [[H1961]] here.’” [[H2088]] 
23 “Let her  keep the items,” [[H3947]] Judah [[H3063]] replied. [[H559]] “Otherwise [[H6435]] we will become [[H1961]] a laughingstock. [[H937]] After all, [[H2009]] I did send her [[H7971]] this [[H2088]] young goat, [[H1423]] but you [[H859]] could not [[H3808]] find her.” [[H4672]] 
24 About [[H1961]] three [[H7969]] months later, [[H2320]] Judah [[H3063]] was told, [[H5046]] “Your daughter-in-law [[H3618]] Tamar [[H8559]] has prostituted herself, [[H2181]] and [[H1571]] now [[H2009]] she is pregnant.” [[H2030]] “Bring her out!” [[H3318]] Judah [[H3063]] replied. [[H559]] “Let her be burned to death!” [[H8313]] 
25 As she [[H1931]] was being brought out, [[H3318]] she [[H1931]] sent [[H7971]] a message [[H559]] to her [[H413]] father-in-law: [[H2524]] “I am [[H595]] pregnant [[H2030]] by the man to whom [[H834]] these items [[H428]] belong.”  And she added, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] examine them. [[H5234]] Whose [[H4310]] seal [[H2858]] and cord [[H6616]] and staff [[H4294]] are these?” [[H428]] 
26 Judah [[H3063]] recognized [the items] [[H5234]] and said, [[H559]] “She is more righteous [[H6663]] than I, [[H4480]] since [[H3588]] I did not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] her to my son [[H1121]] Shelah.” [[H7956]] And he did not [[H3808]] have relations with her [[H3045]] again. [[H3254]] 
27 When the time [[H6256]] came [[H1961]] for [Tamar] to give birth, [[H3205]] there [[H2009]] were twins [[H8380]] in her womb. [[H990]] 
28 And [[H1961]] as she was giving birth, [[H3205]] one of them put out [[H5414]] his hand; [[H3027]] so the midwife [[H3205]] took [[H3947]] a scarlet thread [[H8144]] and tied [it] [[H7194]] around [[H5921]] his wrist. [[H3027]] “This [[H2088]] one came out [[H3318]] first,” [[H7223]] she announced. [[H559]] 
29 But when he pulled his hand [[H3027]] back [[H7725]] and his brother [[H251]] came out, [[H3318]] she said, [[H559]] “You have broken out first!” [[H6555]] So he was named [[H7121]] Perez. [[H6557]] 
30 Then [[H310]] his brother [[H251]] came out [[H3318]] with [[H834]] the scarlet thread [[H8144]] around [[H5921]] his wrist, [[H3027]] and he was named [[H7121]] Zerah. [[H2226]]
