# Genesis 2
[[Genesis 1|←]] • [[Genesis 3|→]]
1 Thus the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth [[H776]] were completed [[H3615]] in all [[H3605]] their vast array. [[H6635]] 
2 And by the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] God [[H430]] had finished [[H3615]] the work [[H4399]] He had been doing; [[H6213]] so on [that] [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] He rested [[H7673]] from all [[H3605]] His work. [[H4399]] 
3 Then God [[H430]] blessed [[H1288]] the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] and sanctified [[H6942]] it, [[H853]] because [[H3588]] on [that day]  He rested [[H7673]] from all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] of creation [[H1254]] that [[H834]] [He] [[H430]] had accomplished. [[H6213]] 
4 This [[H428]] [is] the account [[H8435]] of the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth [[H776]] when they were created, [[H1254]] in the day [[H3117]] that the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] made [[H6213]] [them]. [[H776]] 
5 Now [[H3605]] [no] shrub [[H7880]] of the field [[H7704]] had yet [[H2962]] appeared [[H1961]] on the earth, [[H776]] nor had any [[H3605]] plant [[H6212]] of the field [[H7704]] sprouted; [[H6779]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] had not [yet] [[H3808]] sent rain [[H4305]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] and [there was] no [[H369]] man [[H120]] to cultivate [[H5647]] the ground. [[H127]] 
6 But springs [[H108]] welled up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the earth [[H776]] and watered [[H8248]] the whole [[H3605]] surface [[H6440]] of the ground. [[H127]] 
7 Then the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] formed [[H3335]] man [[H120]] [from] the dust [[H6083]] of [[H4480]] the ground [[H127]] and breathed [[H5301]] the breath [[H5397]] of life [[H2416]] into his nostrils, [[H639]] and the man [[H120]] became [[H1961]] a living [[H2416]] being. [[H5315]] 
8 And the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] planted [[H5193]] a garden [[H1588]] in Eden, [[H5731]] in the east, [[H6924]] where [[H8033]] He placed [[H7760]] the man [[H120]] He had formed. [[H3335]] 
9 Out [[H4480]] of the ground [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] gave growth [[H6779]] to every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] that is pleasing [[H2530]] to the eye [[H4758]] and good [[H2896]] for food. [[H3978]] And in the middle [[H8432]] of the garden [[H1588]] [were] the tree [[H6086]] of life [[H2416]] and the tree [[H6086]] of the knowledge [[H1847]] of good [[H2896]] and evil. [[H7451]] 
10 Now a river [[H5104]] flowed out [[H3318]] of Eden [[H5731]] to water [[H8248]] the garden, [[H1588]] and from there [[H8033]] it branched into [[H6504]] four [[H702]] headwaters: [[H7218]] 
11 The name [[H8034]] of the first [river] [[H259]] [is] Pishon; [[H6376]] it [[H1931]] winds through [[H5437]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] of Havilah, [[H2341]] where [[H834]] there [is] [[H8033]] gold. [[H2091]] 
12 And the gold [[H2091]] of that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] [is] pure, [[H2896]] [and] bdellium [[H916]] and onyx [[H7718]] [are found] there. [[H8033]] 
13 The name [[H8034]] of the second [[H8145]] river [[H5104]] [is] Gihon; [[H1521]] it [[H1931]] winds through [[H5437]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] of Cush. [[H3568]] 
14 The name [[H8034]] of the third [[H7992]] river [[H5104]] [is] Hiddekel; [[H2313]] it [[H1931]] runs along [[H1980]] the east side [[H6926]] of Assyria. [[H804]] And the fourth [[H7243]] river [[H5104]] [is the] [[H1931]] Euphrates. [[H6578]] 
15 Then the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] took [[H3947]] the man [[H120]] and placed him [[H3240]] in the Garden [[H1588]] of Eden [[H5731]] to cultivate [[H5647]] and keep it. [[H8104]] 
16 And the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] [him], [[H120]] “You may eat freely [[H398]] from every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] of the garden, [[H1588]] 
17 but you must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] from [[H4480]] the tree [[H6086]] of the knowledge [[H1847]] of good [[H2896]] and evil; [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] in the day [[H3117]] that you eat [[H398]] of it, [[H4480]] you will surely [[H4191]] die.” [[H4191]] 
18 The LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] also said, [[H559]] “[It is] not [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] for the man [[H120]] to be [[H1961]] alone. [[H905]] I will make [[H6213]] for him  a suitable [[H5048]] helper.” [[H5828]] 
19 And out of [[H4480]] the ground [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] formed [[H3335]] every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] and every [[H3605]] bird [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] and He brought [them] [[H935]] to [[H413]] the man [[H120]] to see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] he would name [[H7121]] each one. [[H3605]] And whatever the man [[H120]] called [[H7121]] each living [[H2416]] creature, [[H5315]] that [[H1931]] [was] its name. [[H8034]] 
20 The man [[H120]] gave [[H7121]] names [[H8034]] to all [[H3605]] the livestock, [[H929]] to the birds [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] and to every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field. [[H7704]] But for Adam [[H120]] no [[H3808]] suitable [[H5048]] helper [[H5828]] was found. [[H4672]] 
21 So the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] caused [[H5307]] the man [[H120]] to fall into [[H5921]] a deep sleep, [[H8639]] and while he slept, [[H3462]] He took [[H3947]] one [[H259]] of [the man’s] ribs [[H6763]] and closed up [[H5462]] the area [[H8478]] with flesh. [[H1320]] 
22 And from the rib [[H6763]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] had taken [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] the man, [[H120]] He made [[H1129]] a woman [[H802]] and brought [[H935]] her to [[H413]] [him]. [[H120]] 
23 And the man [[H120]] said: [[H559]] “This [[H2063]] [is] now [[H6471]] bone [[H6106]] of my bones [[H6106]] and flesh [[H1320]] of my flesh; [[H1320]] she [[H2063]] shall be called [[H7121]] ‘woman,’ [[H802]] for [[H3588]] out of man [[H376]] she [[H2063]] was taken.” [[H3947]] 
24 For [[H5921]] this reason [[H3651]] a man [[H376]] will leave [[H5800]] his father [[H1]] and [[H853]] his mother [[H517]] and [[H1961]] be united [[H1692]] to his wife, [[H802]] and they will become one [[H259]] flesh. [[H1320]] 
25 And the man [[H120]] and his wife [[H802]] were [[H1961]] both [[H8147]] naked, [[H6174]] and they were not [[H3808]] ashamed. [[H954]]
