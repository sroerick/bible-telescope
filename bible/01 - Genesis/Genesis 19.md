# Genesis 19
[[Genesis 18|←]] • [[Genesis 20|→]]
1 The two [[H8147]] angels [[H4397]] entered [[H935]] Sodom [[H5467]] in the evening, [[H6153]] and Lot [[H3876]] was sitting [[H3427]] in the gateway [[H8179]] of [the city]. [[H5467]] When Lot [[H3876]] saw them, [[H7200]] he got up [[H6965]] to meet them, [[H7125]] bowed [[H7812]] with his face [[H639]] to the ground, [[H776]] 
2 and said, [[H559]] “My lords, [[H113]] please [[H4994]] turn aside [[H5493]] into [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of your servant; [[H5650]] wash [[H7364]] your feet [[H7272]] and spend the night. [[H3885]] Then you can rise early [[H7925]] and go [[H1980]] on your way.” [[H1870]] “No,” [[H3808]] they answered, [[H559]] “we will spend the night [[H3885]] in the square.” [[H7339]] 
3 But [Lot] insisted [[H6484]] so strongly [[H3966]] that they followed [[H5493]] him [[H413]] into [[H413]] his house. [[H1004]] He prepared [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] for them  and baked [[H644]] unleavened bread, [[H4682]] and they ate. [[H398]] 
4 Before [[H2962]] they had gone to bed, [[H7901]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of the city [[H5892]] of Sodom, [[H5467]] both young [[H5288]] and [[H5704]] old, [[H2205]] surrounded [[H5437]] the house. [[H1004]] 
5 They called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Lot, [[H3876]] saying, [[H559]] “Where [[H346]] are the men [[H376]] who [[H834]] came [[H935]] to you tonight? [[H413]] Send them out [[H3318]] to us [[H413]] so we can have relations [[H3045]] with them!” [[H853]] 
6 Lot [[H3876]] went [[H3318]] outside [[H6607]] to meet them [[H413]] and shut [[H5462]] the door [[H1817]] behind him. [[H310]] 
7 “Please, [[H4994]] my brothers,” [[H251]] he pleaded, [[H559]] “don’t [[H408]] do such a wicked thing! [[H7489]] 
8 Look, [[H2009]] I have two [[H8147]] daughters [[H1323]] who [[H834]] have never [[H3808]] slept with [[H3045]] a man. [[H376]] Let me bring them [[H3318]] to you, [[H413]] and you can do [[H6213]] to them  whatever you want. [[H2896]] But [[H7535]] do not [[H408]] do [[H6213]] anything [[H1697]] to these [[H411]] men, [[H376]] for [[H3588]] they have come [[H935]] under the protection [[H6738]] of my roof. [[H6982]] 
9 “Get out of the way!” [[H5066]] they replied. [[H559]] And they declared, [[H559]] “This one [[H259]] came [[H935]] here as a foreigner, [[H1481]] and he is already acting like a judge! [[H8199]] Now [[H6258]] we will treat you worse [[H7489]] than them.” [[H1992]] And they pressed [[H6484]] in on Lot [[H3876]] and moved in [[H5066]] to break down [[H7665]] the door. [[H1817]] 
10 But the men [inside] [[H376]] reached out, [[H7971]] pulled [[H935]] Lot [[H3876]] into the house [[H1004]] with them, [[H413]] and shut [[H5462]] the door. [[H1817]] 
11 And [[H853]] they struck [[H5221]] with blindness [[H5575]] the men [[H376]] at the entrance, [[H6607]] both young [[H6996]] and [[H5704]] old, [[H1419]] so that they were unable [[H3811]] to find [[H4672]] the door. [[H6607]] 
12 Then the [two] men [[H376]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Lot, [[H3876]] “Do you have anyone [[H4310]] else [[H5750]] here— [[H6311]] a son-in-law, [[H2860]] your sons [[H1121]] or daughters, [[H1323]] or anyone [[H3605]] else in the city [[H5892]] who belongs to you? [[H834]] Get them out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] here, [[H4725]] 
13 because [[H3588]] we [[H587]] are about to destroy [[H7843]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]] For [[H3588]] the outcry [[H6818]] to [[H854]] the LORD [[H3068]] [against its people] is so great [[H1431]] that [He] [[H3068]] has sent [[H7971]] us to destroy it.” [[H7843]] 
14 So Lot [[H3876]] went out [[H3318]] and spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the sons-in-law [[H2860]] who were pledged in marriage to [[H3947]] his daughters. [[H1323]] “Get up,” [[H6965]] he said. [[H559]] “Get out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is about to destroy [[H7843]] the city!” [[H5892]] But his sons-in-law [[H2860]] thought [[H5869]] he was [[H1961]] joking. [[H6711]] 
15 At [[H3644]] daybreak [[H7837]] the angels [[H4397]] hurried [[H213]] Lot along, [[H3876]] saying, [[H559]] “Get up! [[H6965]] Take [[H3947]] your wife [[H802]] and your two [[H8147]] daughters [[H1323]] who are here, [[H4672]] or [[H6435]] you will be swept away [[H5595]] in the punishment [[H5771]] of the city.” [[H5892]] 
16 But when [Lot] hesitated, [[H4102]] the men [[H376]] grabbed [[H2388]] his hand [[H3027]] and the hands [[H3027]] of his wife [[H802]] and [[H3027]] his two [[H8147]] daughters. [[H1323]] And they led them [[H3318]] safely [[H3240]] out of [[H2351]] the city, [[H5892]] because of the LORD’s [[H3068]] compassion [[H2551]] for them. [[H5921]] 
17 As soon as the men had brought [[H3318]] them out, [[H2351]] one of them said, [[H559]] “Run [[H4422]] for [[H5921]] your lives! [[H5315]] Do not [[H408]] look [[H5027]] back, [[H310]] and do not [[H408]] stop [[H5975]] anywhere [[H3605]] on the plain! [[H3603]] Flee [[H4422]] to the mountains, [[H2022]] or [[H6435]] you will be swept away!” [[H5595]] 
18 But Lot [[H3876]] replied, [[H559]] “No, [[H408]] my lords, [[H136]] please! [[H4994]] 
19 Your servant [[H5650]] has indeed [[H2009]] found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your sight, [[H5869]] and you have shown [[H6213]] me great [[H1431]] kindness [[H2617]] by sparing [[H2421]] my life. [[H5315]] But I [[H595]] cannot [[H3808]] run [[H4422]] to the mountains; [[H2022]] the disaster [[H7451]] will overtake me, [[H1692]] and I will die. [[H4191]] 
20 Look, [[H2009]] this [[H2063]] town [[H5892]] [is] near [[H7138]] enough for me flee to it, [[H5127]] and it [[H1931]] is a small place. [[H4705]] Please [[H4994]] let me flee [[H4422]] there— [[H8033]] is it [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] a small place? [[H4705]] Then my life [[H5315]] will be saved.” [[H2421]] 
21 “Very well,” [[H2009]] he answered, [[H559]] “I will grant this request [[H5375]] as well, [[H1571]] and will not [[H1115]] demolish [[H2015]] the town [[H5892]] you indicate. [[H1696]] 
22 Hurry! [[H4116]] Run [[H4422]] there quickly, [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] I cannot [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] anything [[H1697]] until [[H5704]] you reach [[H935]] it.” [[H8033]] That is why [[H5921]] the town [[H5892]] was called [[H7121]] Zoar. [[H6820]] 
23 When the sun [[H8121]] had risen [[H3318]] over [[H5921]] the land, [[H776]] Lot [[H3876]] had reached [[H935]] Zoar. [[H6820]] 
24 Then the LORD [[H3068]] rained down [[H4305]] brimstone [[H1614]] and fire [[H784]] on [[H5921]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah— [[H6017]] from the LORD [[H3068]] out of [[H4480]] the heavens. [[H8064]] 
25 Thus He destroyed [[H2015]] these [[H411]] cities [[H5892]] and the entire [[H3605]] plain, [[H3603]] including [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the cities [[H5892]] and everything that grew [[H6780]] on the ground. [[H127]] 
26 But [Lot’s] wife [[H802]] looked [[H5027]] back, [[H310]] and she became [[H1961]] a pillar [[H5333]] of salt. [[H4417]] 
27 Early the next morning, [[H1242]] Abraham [[H85]] got up [[H7925]] and returned to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] he had stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
28 He looked [[H8259]] down [[H5921]] toward [[H6440]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah [[H6017]] and all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of the plain, [[H3603]] and he saw [[H7200]] the smoke [[H7008]] rising [[H5927]] from the land [[H776]] like smoke [[H7008]] from a furnace. [[H3536]] 
29 So [[H1961]] when God [[H430]] destroyed [[H7843]] the cities [[H5892]] of the plain, [[H3603]] He [[H430]] remembered [[H2142]] Abraham, [[H85]] and He brought [[H7971]] Lot [[H3876]] out of the [[H8432]] catastrophe [[H2018]] that destroyed [[H2015]] the cities [[H5892]] where [[H834]] [he] [[H3876]] had lived. [[H3427]] 
30 Lot [[H3876]] and [[H5973]] his two [[H8147]] daughters [[H1323]] left [[H5927]] Zoar [[H6820]] and settled [[H3427]] in the mountains— [[H2022]] for [[H3588]] he was afraid [[H3372]] to stay [[H3427]] in Zoar— [[H6820]] where [they] [[H1931]] lived [[H3427]] in a cave. [[H4631]] 
31 One day the older [daughter] [[H1067]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the younger, [[H6810]] “Our father [[H1]] is old, [[H2204]] and there is no [[H369]] man [[H376]] in the land [[H776]] to sleep with [[H935]] us, [[H5921]] as is the custom [[H1870]] over all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]] 
32 Come, [[H1980]] let us get our father [[H1]] drunk [[H8248]] with wine, [[H3196]] so that we can sleep [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] him and preserve [[H2421]] [his] [[H1]] line.” [[H2233]] 
33 So that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] they got their father [[H1]] drunk [[H8248]] with wine, [[H3196]] and the firstborn [[H1067]] came [[H935]] and slept with [[H7901]] her father; [[H1]] he was not [[H3808]] aware [[H3045]] when she lay down [[H7901]] or when she got up. [[H6965]] 
34 The next day [[H4283]] the older [daughter] [[H1067]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the younger, [[H6810]] “Look, [[H2005]] I slept with [[H7901]] my father [[H1]] last night. [[H570]] Let us get him drunk [[H8248]] with wine [[H3196]] again [[H1571]] tonight, [[H3915]] so you can go [[H935]] sleep [[H7901]] with him, [[H5973]] and we can preserve [[H2421]] our father’s [[H1]] line.” [[H2233]] 
35 So again [[H1571]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] they got their father [[H1]] drunk [[H8248]] with wine, [[H3196]] and the younger [daughter] [[H6810]] went [[H6965]] and slept [[H7901]] with him; [[H5973]] he was not [[H3808]] aware [[H3045]] when she lay down [[H7901]] or when she got up. [[H6965]] 
36 Thus both [[H8147]] of Lot’s [[H3876]] daughters [[H1323]] became pregnant [[H2029]] by their father. [[H1]] 
37 The older [daughter] [[H1067]] gave birth to [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] and named [[H7121]] him Moab. [[H4124]] He [[H1931]] is the father [[H1]] of the Moabites [[H4124]] of [[H5704]] today. [[H3117]] 
38 The younger [daughter] [[H6810]] also [[H1571]] gave birth to [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and she named [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Ben-ammi. [[H1151]] He [[H1931]] is the father [[H1]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] of [[H5704]] today. [[H3117]]
