[[2 Chronicles 16|←]] • [[2 Chronicles 18|→]]
1 Asa's son [[H1121]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] became king [[H4427]] in his place, [[H8478]] and he strengthened himself [[H2388]] against [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
2 He stationed [[H5414]] troops [[H2428]] in every [[H3605]] fortified [[H1219]] city [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and put [[H5414]] garrisons [[H5333]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of Ephraim [[H669]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Asa [[H609]] had captured. [[H3920]] 
3 Now the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] because [[H3588]] he walked [[H1980]] in the earlier [[H7223]] ways [[H1870]] of his father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] He did not [[H3808]] seek out [[H1875]] the Baals, [[H1168]] 
4 but [[H3588]] he sought [[H1875]] the God [[H430]] of his father [[H1]] and walked [[H1980]] by His commandments [[H4687]] rather than [[H3808]] the practices [[H4639]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
5 So the LORD [[H3068]] established [[H3559]] the kingdom [[H4467]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] brought [[H5414]] him [[H3092]] tribute, [[H4503]] so that he had [[H1961]] an abundance [[H7230]] of riches [[H6239]] and honor. [[H3519]] 
6 And his heart [[H3820]] took delight [[H1361]] in the ways [[H1870]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] furthermore, [[H5750]] he removed [[H5493]] the high places [[H1116]] and Asherah poles [[H842]] from Judah. [[H3063]] 
7 In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] Jehoshaphat sent [[H7971]] his officials [[H8269]] Ben-hail, [[H1134]] Obadiah, [[H5662]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] Nethanel, [[H5417]] and Micaiah [[H4322]] to teach [[H3925]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] 
8 accompanied by [[H5973]] certain Levites— [[H3881]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] Nethaniah, [[H5418]] Zebadiah, [[H2069]] Asahel, [[H6214]] Shemiramoth, [[H8070]] Jehonathan, [[H3083]] Adonijah, [[H138]] Tobijah, [[H2900]] and Tob-adonijah— [[H2899]] along with [[H5973]] the priests [[H3548]] Elishama [[H476]] and Jehoram. [[H3088]] 
9 They taught [[H3925]] throughout Judah, [[H3063]] taking with them [[H5973]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] They went [[H5437]] throughout [[H3605]] the towns [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and taught [[H3925]] the people. [[H5971]] 
10 And the dread [[H6343]] of the LORD [[H3068]] fell [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the lands [[H776]] that [[H834]] surrounded [[H5439]] Judah, [[H3063]] so that they did not [[H3808]] make war [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Jehoshaphat. [[H3092]] 
11 Some [[H4480]] Philistines [[H6430]] also brought [[H935]] gifts [[H4503]] and silver [[H3701]] as tribute [[H4853]] to Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] and [[H1571]] the Arabs [[H6163]] brought [[H935]] him  flocks [[H6629]] of 7,700 {} [[H7651]] rams [[H352]] and 7,700 [[H7651]] goats. [[H8495]] 
12 Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] grew stronger [[H1980]] and stronger, [[H4605]] and he built [[H1129]] fortresses [[H1003]] and store [[H4543]] cities [[H5892]] in Judah [[H3063]] 
13 and kept a large amount [[H7227]] of supplies [[H4399]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]] He also had [[H1961]] fighting [[H4421]] men, [[H376]] mighty warriors, [[H1368]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
14 These [[H428]] are their numbers [[H6486]] according to the houses [[H1004]] of their fathers: [[H1]] For Judah, [[H3063]] the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands: [[H505]] Adnah [[H5734]] the commander [[H8269]] and 300,000 [[H7969]] mighty warriors [[H1368]] with him; [[H5973]] 
15 next to [[H5921]] him, [[H3027]] Jehohanan [[H3076]] the commander [[H8269]] and 280,000 [[H3967]] with him; [[H5973]] 
16 next to [[H5921]] him, [[H3027]] Amasiah [[H6007]] son [[H1121]] of Zichri, [[H2147]] the volunteer [[H5068]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] and 200,000 [[H3967]] mighty warriors [[H1368]] with him; [[H5973]] 
17 from [[H4480]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] Eliada, [[H450]] a mighty warrior, [[H1368]] and 200,000 [[H3967]] with him [[H5973]] armed [[H5401]] with bows [[H7198]] and shields; [[H4043]] 
18 and next to [[H5921]] him, [[H3027]] Jehozabad [[H3075]] and 180,000 [[H3967]] with him [[H5973]] equipped [[H2502]] for war. [[H6635]] 
19 These were the men [[H428]] who served [[H8334]] the king, [[H4428]] besides [[H905]] those [[H834]] he [[H4428]] stationed [[H5414]] in the fortified [[H4013]] cities [[H5892]] throughout [[H3605]] Judah. [[H3063]]
