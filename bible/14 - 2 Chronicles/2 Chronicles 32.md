1 After [[H310]] all these [[H428]] acts [[H1697]] of faithfulness, [[H571]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] came [[H935]] and invaded [[H935]] Judah. [[H3063]] He laid siege [[H2583]] to [[H5921]] the fortified [[H1219]] cities, [[H5892]] intending [[H559]] to conquer them [[H1234]] for himself. [[H413]] 
2 When Hezekiah [[H2396]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] had come [[H935]] to make war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] 
3 he consulted [[H3289]] with [[H5973]] his leaders [[H8269]] and commanders [[H1368]] about stopping up [[H5640]] the waters [[H4325]] of the springs [[H5869]] outside [[H2351]] the city, [[H5892]] and they helped him carry it out. [[H5826]] 
4 Many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] assembled [[H6908]] and stopped [[H5640]] up all [[H3605]] the springs [[H4599]] and the stream [[H5158]] that flowed [[H7857]] through [[H8432]] the land. [[H776]] “Why [[H4100]] should the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] come [[H935]] and find [[H4672]] plenty [[H7227]] of water?” [[H4325]] they said. [[H559]] 
5 Then Hezekiah worked resolutely [[H2388]] to rebuild [[H1129]] all [[H3605]] the broken sections of [[H6555]] the wall [[H2346]] and to raise up [[H5927]] towers [on it]. [[H4026]] [He also built] an [[H312]] outer [[H2351]] wall [[H2346]] and reinforced [[H2388]] the supporting terraces [[H4407]] of the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] and he produced [[H6213]] an abundance of [[H7230]] weapons [[H7973]] and shields. [[H4043]] 
6 Hezekiah appointed [[H5414]] military [[H4421]] commanders [[H8269]] over [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] and gathered [[H6908]] the people in [[H413]] the square [[H7339]] of the city [[H5892]] gate. [[H8179]] Then he encouraged [[H1696]] them, [[H3824]] saying, [[H559]] 
7 “Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous! [[H553]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or discouraged [[H2865]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] [and] [[H6440]] the vast army [[H1995]] with him, [[H5973]] for [[H3588]] there is a greater [One] [[H7227]] with us [[H5973]] than with him. [[H5973]] 
8 With him [is only] [[H5973]] an arm [[H2220]] of flesh, [[H1320]] but with us [is] [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3069]] our God [[H430]] to help us [[H5826]] and to fight [[H3898]] our battles.” [[H4421]] So the people [[H5971]] were strengthened [[H5564]] by [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
9 Later, [[H310]] as Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] and all [[H3605]] his forces [[H4475]] besieged Lachish, [[H3923]] he sent [[H7971]] his servants [[H5650]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] with a message [[H559]] for [[H5921]] King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] of Judah [[H3063]] and [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people of Judah [[H3063]] who [[H834]] were in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] 
10 “This is what [[H3541]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] says: [[H559]] What [[H4100]] is the basis [[H5921]] of your [[H859]] confidence, [[H982]] that you remain [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] under siege? [[H4692]] 
11 Is not [[H3808]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] misleading [[H5496]] you [[H853]] to give you over [[H5414]] to death [[H4191]] by famine [[H7458]] and thirst [[H6772]] when he says, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] will deliver us [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3709]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria?’ [[H804]] 
12 Did not [[H3808]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] himself [[H1931]] remove [[H5493]] His high places [[H1116]] and His altars [[H4196]] and say [[H559]] to Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] ‘You must worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] one [[H259]] altar, [[H4196]] and on it [[H5921]] you shall burn sacrifices’? [[H6999]] 
13 Do you not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] I [[H589]] and my fathers [[H1]] have done [[H6213]] to all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] of the lands? [[H776]] Have the gods [[H430]] of these nations [[H1471]] ever [[H3605]] been able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] their land [[H776]] from my hand? [[H3027]] 
14 Who [[H4310]] among all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] my fathers [[H1]] destroyed [[H2763]] has been able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] his people [[H5971]] from my hand. [[H3027]] How then [[H3588]] can [[H3201]] your God [[H430]] deliver [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from my hand? [[H3027]] 
15 So now, [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] let Hezekiah [[H2396]] deceive you, [[H5377]] and do not [[H408]] let him mislead [[H5496]] you [[H853]] like this. [[H2063]] Do not [[H408]] believe him, [[H539]] for [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] god [[H433]] of any [[H3605]] nation [[H1471]] or kingdom [[H4467]] has been able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] his people [[H5971]] from my hand [[H3027]] or from the hand [[H3027]] of my fathers. [[H1]] How much less [[H637]] will your God [[H430]] deliver [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from my hand! [[H3027]] 
16 And the servants of Sennacherib [[H5650]] spoke [[H1696]] further [[H5750]] against [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] and against [[H5921]] His servant [[H5650]] Hezekiah. [[H2396]] 
17 He also wrote [[H3789]] letters [[H5612]] mocking [[H2778]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and saying [[H559]] against Him: [[H5921]] “Just as the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H1471]] did not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] their people [[H5971]] from my hand, [[H3027]] so [[H3651]] the God [[H430]] of Hezekiah [[H2396]] will not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] His people [[H5971]] from my hand. [[H3027]] 
18 Then [the Assyrians] called out [[H7121]] loudly [[H6963]] in Hebrew [[H3066]] to [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] who [[H834]] were on [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] to frighten [[H3372]] and terrify them [[H926]] in order that [[H4616]] to capture [[H3920]] the city. [[H5892]] 
19 They spoke [[H1696]] against [[H413]] the God [[H430]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] as they had spoken against [[H5921]] the gods [[H430]] of the peoples [[H5971]] of the earth— [[H776]] the work [[H4639]] of human [[H120]] hands. [[H3027]] 
20 In response, [[H5921]] King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] and the prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] cried out [[H2199]] to heaven [[H8064]] in prayer, [[H6419]] 
21 and the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] an angel [[H4397]] who annihilated [[H3582]] every [[H3605]] mighty warrior, [[H1368]] leader, [[H5057]] and commander [[H8269]] in the camp [[H4264]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] So he withdrew [[H7725]] to his own land [[H776]] in disgrace. [[H1322]] And when he entered [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] of his god, [[H430]] some of his own [sons] [[H4578]] struck him down [[H5307]] with the sword. [[H2719]] 
22 So the LORD [[H3068]] saved [[H3467]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] and the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] from the hand [[H3027]] of King [[H4428]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] of Assyria [[H804]] [and] [[H3027]] of all others, [[H3605]] and He gave them rest [[H5095]] on every side. [[H5439]] 
23 Many [[H7227]] brought [[H935]] offerings [[H4503]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] for the LORD [[H3068]] and valuable gifts [[H4030]] for Hezekiah [[H2396]] king of [[H4428]] Judah, [[H3063]] and from [[H310]] then on [[H3651]] he was exalted [[H5375]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] nations. [[H1471]] 
24 In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] became [[H5704]] mortally [[H4191]] ill. [[H2470]] So he prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who spoke [[H559]] to him  and gave [[H5414]] him  a sign. [[H4159]] 
25 But because [[H3588]] his heart [[H3820]] was proud, [[H1361]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] did not [[H3808]] repay [[H7725]] the favor [shown] [[H1576]] to him. [[H5921]] Therefore wrath [[H7110]] came [[H1961]] upon him [[H5921]] and upon [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
26 Then Hezekiah [[H2396]] humbled [[H3665]] the pride [[H1363]] of his heart— [[H3820]] he [[H1931]] and the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem— [[H3389]] so that the wrath [[H7110]] of the LORD [[H3068]] did not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] upon them [[H5921]] during the days [[H3117]] of Hezekiah. [[H2396]] 
27 Hezekiah [[H2396]] had [[H1961]] very [[H3966]] great [[H7235]] riches [[H6239]] and honor, [[H3519]] and he made [[H6213]] treasuries [[H214]] for his silver, [[H3701]] gold, [[H2091]] precious [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] spices, [[H1314]] shields, [[H4043]] and all [[H3605]] kinds of valuable [[H2532]] articles. [[H3627]] 
28 He also made storehouses [[H4543]] for the harvest [[H8393]] of grain [[H1715]] and new wine [[H8492]] and oil, [[H3323]] stalls [[H723]] for all kinds [[H3605]] of livestock, [[H929]] and pens [[H220]] for the flocks. [[H5739]] 
29 He made [[H6213]] cities for himself, [[H5892]] and he acquired herds [[H4735]] of sheep [[H6629]] and cattle [[H1241]] in abundance, [[H7230]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] him  very [[H3966]] great [[H7227]] wealth. [[H7399]] 
30 It was [[H1931]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] who blocked [[H5640]] the upper [[H5945]] outlet [[H4161]] of the Spring [[H4325]] of Gihon [[H1521]] and channeled [[H3474]] it down [[H4295]] to the west side [[H4628]] of the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And Hezekiah [[H2396]] prospered [[H6743]] in all [[H3605]] that he did. [[H4639]] 
31 And so [[H3651]] when ambassadors [[H3887]] of the rulers [[H8269]] of Babylon [[H894]] were sent [[H7971]] to him [[H5921]] to inquire about [[H1875]] the wonder [[H4159]] that [[H834]] had happened [[H1961]] in the land, [[H776]] God [[H430]] left [[H5800]] him [alone] to test him, [[H5254]] that He might know [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] that was in [Hezekiah's] heart. [[H3824]] 
32 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts of [[H1697]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] and his deeds of loving devotion, [[H2617]] they are indeed [[H2005]] written [[H3789]] in the vision [[H2377]] of the prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Israel. [[H3478]] 
33 And Hezekiah rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the upper [[H4608]] tombs [[H6913]] of David’s [[H1732]] descendants. [[H1121]] All [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] paid [[H6213]] him honor [[H3519]] at his death. [[H4194]] And his son [[H1121]] Manasseh [[H4519]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
