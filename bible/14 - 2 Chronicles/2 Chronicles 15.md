1 Now the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Oded. [[H5752]] 
2 So he went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H6440]] Asa [[H609]] and said [[H559]] to him,  “Listen to me, [[H8085]] Asa [[H609]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin. [[H1144]] The LORD [[H3068]] is with you [[H5973]] when you are [[H1961]] with Him. [[H5973]] If [[H518]] you seek Him, [[H1875]] He will be found [[H4672]] by you,  but if [[H518]] you forsake Him, [[H5800]] He will forsake [[H5800]] you. [[H853]] 
3 For many [[H7227]] years [[H3117]] Israel [[H3478]] has been without [[H3808]] the true [[H571]] God, [[H430]] without [[H3808]] a priest [[H3548]] to instruct them, [[H3384]] and without [[H3808]] law. [[H8451]] 
4 But in their distress [[H6862]] they turned [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and sought Him, [[H1245]] and He was found [[H4672]] by them.  
5 In those [[H1992]] days [[H6251]] there was no [[H369]] safety [[H7965]] for travelers, [[H3318]] because [[H3588]] the residents [[H3427]] of the lands [[H776]] had [[H5921]] many [[H7227]] conflicts. [[H4103]] 
6 Nation [[H1471]] was crushed [[H3807]] by nation, [[H1471]] and city [[H5892]] by city, [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] afflicted them [[H2000]] with all kinds of [[H3605]] adversity. [[H6869]] 
7 But as for you, [[H859]] be strong; [[H2388]] do not [[H408]] be discouraged, [[H7503]] for [[H3588]] your work [[H6468]] will be [[H3426]] rewarded.” [[H7939]] 
8 When Asa [[H609]] heard [[H8085]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] and the prophecy [[H5016]] of Azariah son of Oded [[H5752]] the prophet, [[H5030]] he took courage [[H2388]] and removed [[H5674]] the detestable idols [[H8251]] from [[H4480]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] and from the cities [[H5892]] he had captured [[H3920]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim. [[H669]] He then restored [[H2318]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] was in front [[H6440]] of the portico [[H197]] of the LORDs temple. [[H3068]] 
9 And he assembled [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] along with those from the tribes of Ephraim, [[H669]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] and Simeon [[H8095]] who had settled [[H1481]] among them, [[H5973]] for [[H3588]] great numbers [[H7230]] had come over [[H5307]] to him [[H5921]] from Israel [[H3478]] when they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] was with him. [[H5973]] 
10 So they gathered together [[H6908]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] in the third [[H7992]] month [[H2320]] of the fifteenth [[H2568]] year [[H8141]] of Asa’s [[H609]] reign. [[H4438]] 
11 At that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] they sacrificed [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] oxen [[H1241]] and seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] sheep [[H6629]] from [[H4480]] all the plunder [[H7998]] they had brought back. [[H935]] 
12 Then they entered [[H935]] into a covenant [[H1285]] to seek [[H1875]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] with all [[H3605]] their heart [[H3824]] and [[H3605]] soul. [[H5315]] 
13 And [[H3605]] whoever [[H834]] would not [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] the LORD, [[H3069]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] would be put to death, [[H4191]] whether [[H4480]] young [[H6996]] or [[H5704]] old, [[H1419]] man [[H376]] or [[H5704]] woman. [[H802]] 
14 They took an oath [[H7650]] to the LORD [[H3068]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] with shouting, [[H8643]] trumpets, [[H2689]] and horns. [[H7782]] 
15 And all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] rejoiced [[H8055]] over [[H5921]] the oath, [[H7621]] for [[H3588]] they had sworn [[H7650]] it with all [[H3605]] their heart. [[H3824]] They had sought [[H1245]] Him earnestly, [[H3605]] and He was found [[H4672]] by them.  So the LORD [[H3068]] gave them rest [[H5117]] on every side. [[H5439]] 
16 King [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] also [[H1571]] removed [[H5493]] his grandmother [[H517]] Maacah [[H4601]] as the queen mother, [[H1377]] because [[H834]] she had made [[H6213]] a detestable [[H4656]] Asherah pole. [[H842]] Asa [[H609]] chopped down [[H3772]] the pole, [[H4656]] crushed it, [[H1854]] and burned [[H8313]] it in the Kidron [[H6939]] Valley. [[H5158]] 
17 The high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] removed [[H5493]] from Israel, [[H3478]] but [[H7535]] Asa's [[H609]] heart [[H3824]] was [[H1961]] fully devoted [[H8003]] all [[H3605]] his days. [[H3117]] 
18 And he brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] articles [[H3627]] that he [[H6944]] and his father [[H1]] had dedicated. [[H6942]] 
19 And there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] war [[H4421]] until [[H5704]] the thirty-fifth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of Asa’s [[H609]] reign. [[H4438]]
