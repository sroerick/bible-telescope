1 Now when the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] heard [[H8085]] about the fame [[H8088]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] she came [[H935]] to test [[H5254]] [him] [[H8010]] with difficult questions. [[H2420]] [She arrived] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] with a very [[H3966]] large [[H3515]] caravan, [[H2428]] with camels [[H1581]] bearing [[H5375]] spices, [[H1314]] gold [[H2091]] in abundance, [[H7230]] and precious [[H3368]] stones. [[H68]] So she came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Solomon [[H8010]] and spoke [[H1696]] to him [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was [[H1961]] on [[H5973]] her mind. [[H3824]] 
2 And Solomon [[H8010]] answered [[H5046]] all [[H3605]] her questions; [[H1697]] nothing [[H3808]] was too difficult [[H5956]] for [him] [[H8010]] to explain. [[H5046]] 
3 When the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] saw [[H7200]] the wisdom [[H2451]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] the palace [[H1004]] he had built, [[H1129]] 
4 the food [[H3978]] at his table, [[H7979]] the seating [[H4186]] of his servants, [[H5650]] the service [[H4612]] and attire [[H4403]] of his attendants [[H8334]] and cupbearers, [[H4945]] and the burnt offerings [[H5930]] he presented [[H5927]] at the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] it took her breath away. [[H7307]] 
5 She said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “The report [[H1697]] I heard [[H8085]] in my own country [[H776]] about [[H5921]] your words [[H1697]] [and] [[H5921]] wisdom [[H2451]] is true. [[H571]] 
6 But I did not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] the reports [[H1697]] until [[H5704]] I came [[H935]] and saw [[H7200]] with my own eyes. [[H5869]] Indeed, [[H2009]] not [[H3808]] half [[H2677]] of the greatness [[H4768]] of your wisdom [[H2451]] was told [[H5046]] to me.  You have far exceeded [[H3254]] the report [[H8052]] I heard. [[H8085]] 
7 How blessed [[H835]] are your men! [[H376]] How blessed [[H835]] are these [[H428]] servants of yours [[H5650]] who stand [[H5975]] continually [[H8548]] before you [[H6440]] and hear [[H8085]] your wisdom. [[H2451]] 
8 Blessed [[H1288]] be [[H1961]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] has delighted [[H2654]] in you  to set [[H5414]] you on [[H5921]] His throne [[H3678]] [to be] king [[H4428]] for the LORD [[H3069]] your God. [[H430]] Because your God [[H430]] loved [[H160]] Israel [[H3478]] enough to establish them [[H5975]] forever, [[H5769]] He has made you [[H5414]] king [[H4428]] over them [[H5921]] to carry out [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness. [[H6666]] 
9 Then she gave [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] 120 [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]] a great quantity of [[H7230]] spices, [[H1314]] and precious [[H3368]] stones. [[H68]] There had never been [[H1961]] such [[H1931]] spices [[H1314]] as those [[H834]] the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] gave [[H5414]] to King [[H4428]] Solomon. [[H8010]] 
10 (The servants [[H5650]] of Hiram [[H2438]] [and] [[H5650]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] who [[H834]] brought [[H935]] gold [[H2091]] from Ophir, [[H211]] also [[H1571]] brought [[H935]] algum [[H418]] wood [[H6086]] and precious [[H3368]] stones. [[H68]] 
11 The king [[H4428]] made [[H6213]] the algum [[H418]] wood [[H6086]] into steps [[H4546]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and for the king’s [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and into lyres [[H3658]] and harps [[H5035]] for the singers. [[H7891]] Never [[H3808]] before [[H6440]] had anything like them [[H1992]] been seen [[H7200]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah.) [[H3063]] 
12 King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] gave [[H5414]] the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] all [[H3605]] she desired— [[H2656]] whatever [[H834]] she asked— [[H7592]] far more than [[H905]] she had brought [[H935]] the king. [[H4428]] Then she [[H1931]] left [[H2015]] and returned [[H1980]] to her own country, [[H776]] along with her servants. [[H5650]] 
13 The weight [[H4948]] of gold [[H2091]] that [[H834]] came [[H935]] to Solomon [[H8010]] each year [[H8141]] was [[H1961]] 666 [[H8337]] talents, [[H3603]] 
14 not including [[H905]] the revenue [[H935]] from the merchants [[H376]] and traders. [[H5503]] And all [[H3605]] the Arabian [[H6152]] kings [[H4428]] and governors [[H6346]] of the land [[H776]] also brought [[H935]] gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] to Solomon. [[H8010]] 
15 King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] made [[H6213]] two hundred [[H3967]] large shields [[H6793]] of hammered [[H7820]] gold; [[H2091]] six [[H8337]] hundred [shekels] [[H3967]] of hammered [[H7820]] gold [[H2091]] went [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] each [[H259]] shield. [[H6793]] 
16 [He also made] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] small shields [[H4043]] of hammered [[H7820]] gold; [[H2091]] three [[H7969]] hundred [shekels] [[H3967]] of gold [[H2091]] went [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] each [[H259]] shield. [[H4043]] And the king [[H4428]] put them [[H5414]] in the House [[H1004]] of the Forest [[H3293]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]] 
17 Additionally, the king [[H4428]] made [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] throne [[H3678]] of ivory [[H8127]] and overlaid it [[H6823]] with pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]] 
18 The throne [[H3678]] had six [[H8337]] steps, [[H4609]] and a footstool [[H3534]] of gold [[H2091]] was attached to it. [[H270]] There were armrests [[H3027]] on both sides [[H2088]] of [[H5921]] the seat, [[H4725]] with a lion [[H738]] standing [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] each armrest. [[H3027]] 
19 Twelve [[H8147]] lions [[H738]] stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the six [[H8337]] steps, [[H4609]] one at either end [[H2088]] of each [step]. [[H2088]] Nothing [[H3808]] like [this] [[H3651]] had ever been made [[H6213]] for any [[H3605]] kingdom. [[H4467]] 
20 All [[H3605]] of King [[H4428]] Solomon’s [[H8010]] drinking [[H4945]] cups [[H3627]] were gold, [[H2091]] and all [[H3605]] the utensils [[H3627]] of the House [[H1004]] of the Forest [[H3293]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] were pure [[H5462]] gold. [[H2091]] There was no [[H369]] silver, [[H3701]] because it was accounted [[H2803]] as nothing [[H3972]] in the days [[H3117]] of Solomon. [[H8010]] 
21 For [[H3588]] the king had [[H4428]] the ships [[H591]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] that went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] Hiram’ s [[H2361]] servants, [[H5650]] and once [[H259]] every three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] the ships [[H591]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] would arrive [[H935]] bearing [[H5375]] gold, [[H2091]] silver, [[H3701]] ivory, [[H8143]] apes, [[H6971]] and peacocks. [[H8500]] 
22 So King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] surpassed [[H1431]] all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] in riches [[H6239]] and wisdom. [[H2451]] 
23 All [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] sought [[H1245]] an audience [[H6440]] with Solomon [[H8010]] to hear [[H8085]] the wisdom [[H2451]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] had put [[H5414]] in his heart. [[H3820]] 
24 Year [[H8141]] after year, [[H8141]] [each] visitor [[H376]] would bring [[H935]] his tribute: [[H4503]] articles [[H3627]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] clothing, [[H8008]] weapons, [[H5402]] spices, [[H1314]] horses, [[H5483]] and mules. [[H6505]] 
25 Solomon [[H8010]] had [[H1961]] 4,000 {} [[H702]] stalls [[H723]] for horses [[H5483]] and chariots, [[H4818]] and 12,000 [[H8147]] horses, [[H6571]] which he stationed [[H3240]] in the chariot [[H7393]] cities [[H5892]] and also with [[H5973]] [him] [[H4428]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
26 He reigned [[H4910]] over all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] from [[H4480]] the Euphrates [[H5104]] to [[H5704]] the land [[H776]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] as [[H5704]] far as the border [[H1366]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
27 The king [[H4428]] made [[H5414]] silver [[H3701]] as common in Jerusalem [[H3389]] as stones, [[H68]] and [[H5414]] cedar [[H730]] as abundant [[H7230]] as sycamore [[H8256]] in the foothills. [[H8219]] 
28 Solomon's [[H8010]] horses [[H5483]] were imported [[H3318]] from Egypt [[H4714]] and from all [[H3605]] the lands. [[H776]] 
29 As for the rest [[H7605]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] from beginning [[H7223]] to end, [[H314]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Records [[H1697]] of Nathan [[H5416]] the Prophet, [[H5030]] in the Prophecy [[H5016]] of Ahijah [[H281]] the Shilonite, [[H7888]] and in the Visions [[H2378]] of Iddo [[H3260]] the Seer [[H2374]] concerning [[H5921]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat? [[H5028]] 
30 Solomon [[H8010]] reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]] 
31 And Solomon [[H8010]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the city [[H5892]] of his father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] And his son [[H1121]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
