1 Joash [[H3101]] was seven [[H7651]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Zibiah; [[H6645]] she was from  Beersheba. [[H884]] 
2 And Joash [[H3101]] did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
3 Jehoiada [[H3077]] took [[H5375]] for himself  two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] and he had [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
4 Some time later, [[H1961]] Joash [[H3101]] set [[H1961]] his heart [[H3820]] on repairing [[H2318]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 So he gathered [[H6908]] the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] and said, [[H559]] “Go out [[H3318]] to the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and collect [[H6908]] the money [[H3701]] due [[H1767]] annually [[H8141]] from all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] to repair [[H2388]] the house [[H1004]] of your God. [[H430]] Do it [[H1697]] quickly.” [[H4116]] The Levites, however, [[H3881]] did not [[H3808]] make haste. [[H4116]] 
6 So the king [[H4428]] called [[H7121]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the high [[H7218]] priest and said, [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] have you not [[H3808]] required [[H1875]] the Levites [[H3881]] to bring [[H935]] from Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] the tax imposed [[H4864]] by Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and by the assembly [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] for the Tent [[H168]] of the Testimony? [[H5715]] 
7 For [[H3588]] the sons [[H1121]] of that wicked woman [[H4849]] Athaliah [[H6271]] had broken into [[H6555]] the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] and had even [[H1571]] used [[H6213]] the sacred objects [[H6944]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] for the Baals. [[H1168]] 
8 At the king’s [[H4428]] command [[H559]] a [[H259]] chest [[H727]] was made [[H6213]] and placed [[H5414]] outside, [[H2351]] at the gate [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
9 And a proclamation [[H6963]] was issued [[H5414]] in Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] that they were to bring [[H935]] to the LORD [[H3068]] the tax [[H4864]] [imposed by] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of God [[H430]] on [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
10 All [[H3605]] the officers [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] rejoiced [[H8055]] and brought their contributions, [[H935]] and they dropped them [[H7993]] in the chest [[H727]] until [[H5704]] it was full. [[H3615]] 
11 Whenever [[H6256]] the chest [[H727]] was brought [[H935]] by [[H3027]] the Levites [[H3881]] to [[H413]] the king’s [[H4428]] overseers [[H6486]] and they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] there was a large amount [[H7227]] of money, [[H3701]] the royal [[H4428]] scribe [[H5608]] and the officer [[H6496]] of the high [[H7218]] priest [[H3548]] would come [[H935]] and empty [[H6168]] the chest [[H727]] and carry it [[H5375]] back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] its place. [[H4725]] They did [[H6213]] this [[H3541]] daily [[H3117]] and gathered [[H622]] the money [[H3701]] in abundance. [[H7230]] 
12 Then the king [[H4428]] and Jehoiada [[H3077]] would give [the money] [[H5414]] of those who [[H413]] supervised [[H6213]] the labor [[H5656]] on the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to hire [[H7936]] stonecutters [[H2672]] and carpenters [[H2796]] to restore [[H2318]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H1571]] workers [[H2796]] in iron [[H1270]] and bronze [[H5178]] to repair [[H2388]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 So the workmen [[H6213]] labored, [[H6213]] and in their hands [[H3027]] the repair [[H724]] work [[H4399]] progressed. [[H5927]] They restored [[H5975]] the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] according [[H5921]] to its specifications, [[H4971]] and they reinforced it. [[H553]] 
14 When they had finished, [[H3615]] they brought [[H935]] the rest [[H7605]] of the money [[H3701]] to [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] and Jehoiada [[H3077]] to make with it [[H6213]] the articles [[H3627]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] utensils [[H3627]] for the service [[H8335]] and for the burnt offerings, [[H5927]] dishes, [[H3709]] and other objects [[H3627]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver. [[H3701]] Throughout [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] were presented [[H5927]] regularly [[H8548]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 When Jehoiada was old [[H2204]] and full of [[H7646]] years, [[H3117]] [he] [[H3077]] died [[H4191]] at the age [[H8141]] of 130. [[H3967]] 
16 And [Jehoiada] was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] the kings [[H4428]] in the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] because [[H3588]] he had done [[H6213]] what was good [[H2896]] in Israel [[H3478]] for [[H5973]] God [[H430]] and His temple. [[H1004]] 
17 After [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Jehoiada, however, [[H3077]] the officials [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] came [[H935]] and paid homage [[H7812]] to the king, [[H4428]] and [[H227]] [he] [[H4428]] listened [[H8085]] to them. [[H413]] 
18 They abandoned [[H5800]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] and served [[H5647]] the Asherah poles [[H842]] and idols. [[H6091]] So wrath [[H7110]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] for this [[H2063]] guilt of theirs. [[H819]] 
19 Nevertheless, [the LORD] sent [[H7971]] prophets [[H5030]] to bring [the people] back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] [Him] [[H3068]] and to testify [[H5749]] against them;  but they would not [[H3808]] listen. [[H238]] 
20 Then the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came upon [[H3847]] Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest, [[H3548]] who stood up [[H5975]] before [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] and said [[H559]] to them,  “This is what [[H3541]] God [[H430]] says: [[H559]] ‘Why [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] transgress [[H5674]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] so that you cannot [[H3808]] prosper? [[H6743]] Because [[H3588]] you have forsaken [[H5800]] the LORD, [[H3068]] He has forsaken [[H5800]] you. [[H853]] 
21 But they conspired [[H7194]] against Zechariah, [[H5921]] and by order [[H4687]] of the king, [[H4428]] they stoned him [[H7275]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
22 Thus King [[H4428]] Joash [[H3101]] failed to [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] the kindness [[H2617]] that [[H834]] Zechariah’s father [[H1]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] had extended [[H6213]] to him. [[H5973]] Instead, [Joash] killed [[H2026]] [Jehoiada's] son. [[H1121]] As he lay dying, [[H4191]] [Zechariah] said, [[H559]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] see this [[H7200]] and call you to account.” [[H1875]] 
23 At the turn [[H8622]] of the year, [[H8141]] the army of Aram [[H758]] went to war [[H5927]] against Joash. [[H5921]] They entered [[H935]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] and destroyed [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H8269]] of the people, [[H5971]] and they sent [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] the plunder [[H7998]] to their king [[H4428]] in Damascus. [[H1834]] 
24 Although [[H3588]] the Aramean [[H758]] army [[H2426]] had come [[H935]] with only a few [[H4705]] men, [[H582]] the LORD [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] into their hand [[H3027]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H7230]] army, [[H2428]] because [[H3588]] Judah had forsaken [[H5800]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]] Thus they executed [[H6213]] judgment [[H8201]] on [[H854]] Joash. [[H3101]] 
25 And when [the Arameans] had withdrawn, [[H1980]] they left [[H5800]] [Joash] [[H853]] severely [[H7227]] wounded. [[H4251]] His own servants [[H5650]] conspired [[H7194]] against him [[H5921]] for shedding the blood [[H1818]] of the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest, [[H3548]] and they killed him [[H2026]] on [[H5921]] his bed. [[H4296]] So he died [[H4191]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] but not [[H3808]] in the tombs [[H6913]] of the kings. [[H4428]] 
26 Those [[H428]] who conspired [[H7194]] against [Joash] [[H5921]] were Zabad [[H2066]] son [[H1121]] of the Ammonite woman [[H5985]] Shimeath [[H8100]] as well as Jehozabad [[H3075]] son [[H1121]] of the Moabite woman [[H4125]] Shimrith. [[H8116]] 
27 The accounts of the sons [of Joash], [[H1121]] as well as the many  oracles [[H4853]] about him [[H5921]] and about the restoration [[H3247]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] they [are] indeed [[H2005]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Treatise [[H4097]] of the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings. [[H4428]] And his son [[H1121]] Amaziah [[H558]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
