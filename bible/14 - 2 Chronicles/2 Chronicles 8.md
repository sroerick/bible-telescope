1 Now [[H1961]] at the end [[H7093]] of the twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] during which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had built [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H853]] his own palace, [[H1004]] 
2 Solomon [[H8010]] rebuilt [[H1129]] the cities [[H5892]] Hiram [[H2361]] had given [[H5414]] him [[H8010]] and settled [[H3427]] Israelites [[H1121]] there. [[H8033]] 
3 Then Solomon [[H8010]] went [[H1980]] to Hamath-zobah [[H2578]] and captured [[H2388]] it. [[H5921]] 
4 He built [[H1129]] Tadmor [[H8412]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] along with all [[H3605]] the store [[H4543]] cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] he had built [[H1129]] in Hamath. [[H2574]] 
5 He rebuilt [[H1129]] Upper [[H5945]] and Lower [[H8481]] Beth-horon [[H1032]] as fortified [[H4692]] cities [[H5892]] with walls, [[H2346]] gates, [[H1817]] and bars, [[H1280]] 
6 as well as [[H853]] Baalath, [[H1191]] all [[H3605]] the store [[H4543]] cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] belonged to [[H1961]] Solomon, [[H8010]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] [for his] chariots [[H7393]] and [[H853]] horses, [[H6571]] and everything [[H3605]] [he] [[H8010]] desired [[H2836]] to build [[H1129]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Lebanon, [[H3844]] and throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of his dominion. [[H4474]] 
7 As for all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] who remained [[H3498]] of [[H4480]] the Hittites, [[H2850]] Amorites, [[H567]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites [[H2983]] (the people who [[H834]] were not [[H3808]] Israelites [[H3478]] )— [[H1992]] 
8 their descendants [[H1121]] who [[H834]] remained [[H3498]] in the land, [[H776]] those whom [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] were unable [[H3808]] to destroy completely— [[H3615]] Solomon [[H8010]] conscripted these people [[H5927]] to be forced laborers, [[H4522]] as they are to [[H5704]] this [[H3117]] day. [[H2088]] 
9 But [[H4480]] Solomon [[H8010]] did not [[H3808]] consign [[H5414]] any of the Israelites [[H1121]] to slave [[H5650]] labor, [[H4399]] because [[H3588]] they [were] [[H1992]] his men [[H582]] of war, [[H4421]] his officers [[H8269]] and captains, [[H7991]] and the commanders [[H8269]] of his chariots [[H7393]] and cavalry. [[H6571]] 
10 [They] [[H428]] [were also] the chief [[H8269]] officers [[H5333]] for King [[H4428]] Solomon: [[H8010]] 250 [[H2572]] supervisors. [[H7287]] 
11 Solomon [[H8010]] brought [[H5927]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] up from the City [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] to the palace [[H1004]] he had built [[H1129]] for her.  For [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] “My wife [[H802]] must not [[H3808]] live [[H3427]] in the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H3588]] the places [[H1992]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has entered [[H935]] are holy. [[H6944]] 
12 At that time [[H227]] Solomon [[H8010]] offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] he had built [[H1129]] in front [[H6440]] of the portico. [[H197]] 
13 He observed the daily [[H3117]] requirement [[H1697]] for offerings [[H5927]] according to the commandment [[H4687]] of Moses [[H4872]] for Sabbaths, [[H7676]] New Moons, [[H2320]] and the three [[H7969]] annual [[H8141]] appointed feasts— [[H4150]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Unleavened Bread, [[H4682]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Weeks, [[H7620]] and the Feast [[H2282]] of Tabernacles. [[H5521]] 
14 In keeping with the ordinances [[H4941]] of his father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] he appointed [[H5975]] the divisions [[H4256]] of the priests [[H3548]] over [[H5921]] their service, [[H5656]] and the Levites [[H3881]] for [[H5921]] their duties [[H4931]] to offer praise [[H1984]] and to minister [[H8334]] before [[H5048]] the priests [[H3548]] according to the daily [[H3117]] requirement. [[H1697]] [He also appointed] gatekeepers [[H7778]] by their divisions [[H4256]] at each gate, [[H8179]] for [[H3588]] this [[H3651]] had been the command [[H4687]] of David, [[H1732]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] 
15 They did not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] from the king’s [[H4428]] command [[H4687]] regarding [[H5921]] the priests [[H3548]] or the Levites [[H3881]] or any [[H3605]] matter [[H1697]] concerning the treasuries. [[H214]] 
16 Thus all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] of Solomon [[H8010]] was carried out, [[H3559]] from [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] the foundation was laid [[H4143]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] it was finished. [[H3615]] So the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was completed. [[H8003]] 
17 Then [[H227]] Solomon [[H8010]] went [[H1980]] to Ezion-geber [[H6100]] and to [[H413]] Eloth [[H359]] on [[H5921]] the coast [[H8193]] of Edom. [[H123]] 
18 So Hiram [[H2361]] sent [[H7971]] him  ships [[H591]] by [[H3027]] his servants, [[H5650]] along with crews [[H5650]] of experienced sailors. [[H3045]] They went [[H935]] with [[H5973]] Solomon’s [[H8010]] servants [[H5650]] to Ophir [[H211]] and acquired [[H3947]] from there [[H8033]] 450 {} [[H702]] talents [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]] which they delivered [[H935]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Solomon.
