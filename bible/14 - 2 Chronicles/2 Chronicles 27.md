1 Jotham [[H3147]] was twenty-five [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] sixteen [[H8337]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Jerushah [[H3388]] daughter [[H1323]] of Zadok. [[H6659]] 
2 And he did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] his father [[H1]] Uzziah [[H5818]] had done. [[H6213]] In addition, [[H7535]] he did not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] But the people [[H5971]] still [[H5750]] behaved corruptly. [[H7843]] 
3 Jotham [[H1931]] rebuilt [[H1129]] the Upper [[H5945]] Gate [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and he worked [[H1129]] extensively [[H7230]] on the wall [[H2346]] at Ophel. [[H6077]] 
4 He also built [[H1129]] cities [[H5892]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Judah [[H3063]] and fortresses [[H1003]] and towers [[H4026]] in the forests. [[H2793]] 
5 [Jotham] [[H1931]] waged war [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] and defeated them, [[H2388]] and that [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] they [[H1121]] gave [[H5414]] him  a hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] cors [[H3734]] of wheat, [[H2406]] and ten [[H6235]] thousand [kors] [[H505]] of barley. [[H8184]] They [[H1121]] paid [[H7725]] him  the same [[H2063]] in the second [[H8145]] and third [[H7992]] years. [[H8141]] 
6 So Jotham [[H3147]] grew powerful [[H2388]] because [[H3588]] he ordered [[H3559]] his ways [[H1870]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3069]] his God. [[H430]] 
7 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jotham, [[H3147]] along with all [[H3605]] his wars [[H4421]] and his ways, [[H1870]] they [are] indeed [[H2005]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah. [[H3063]] 
8 He was [[H1961]] twenty-five [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] sixteen [[H8337]] years. [[H8141]] 
9 And Jotham [[H3147]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And his son [[H1121]] Ahaz [[H271]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
