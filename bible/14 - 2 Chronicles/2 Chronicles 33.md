1 Manasseh [[H4519]] was twelve [[H8147]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] fifty-five [[H2572]] years. [[H8141]] 
2 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] by following the abominations [[H8441]] of the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had driven out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
3 For he rebuilt [[H7725]] the high places [[H1116]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] had torn down, [[H5422]] and he raised up [[H6965]] altars [[H4196]] for the Baals [[H1168]] and made [[H6213]] Asherah poles. [[H842]] And he worshiped [[H7812]] and served [[H5647]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven. [[H8064]] 
4 [Manasseh] also built [[H1129]] altars [[H4196]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] of which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said, [[H559]] “My Name [[H8034]] will remain [[H1961]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] forever.” [[H5769]] 
5 In both [[H8147]] courtyards [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] he built [[H1129]] altars [[H4196]] to all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven. [[H8064]] 
6 He [[H1931]] sacrificed [[H5674]] his sons [[H1121]] in the fire [[H784]] in the Valley of Hinnom. [[H1516]] He practiced sorcery, [[H6049]] divination, [[H5172]] and witchcraft, [[H3784]] and consulted [[H6213]] mediums [[H178]] and spiritists. [[H3049]] He did [[H6213]] great [[H7235]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] provoking Him to anger. [[H3707]] 
7 Manasseh even took the carved [[H6459]] image [[H5566]] he had made [[H6213]] and set up [[H7760]] in the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] of which [[H834]] God [[H430]] had said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] and his son [[H1121]] Solomon, [[H8010]] “In this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] I have chosen [[H970]] out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I will establish [[H7760]] My Name [[H8034]] forever. [[H5865]] 
8 I will never [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] cause the feet [[H7272]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] to leave [[H5493]] the land [[H127]] I assigned [[H5975]] to your fathers, [[H1]] if [[H518]] only [[H7535]] they are careful [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] them through [[H3027]] Moses— [[H4872]] all [[H3605]] the laws, [[H8451]] statutes, [[H2706]] and judgments. [[H4941]] 
9 So Manasseh [[H4519]] {led} the people [[H3427]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] astray, [[H8582]] so that they did [[H6213]] greater evil [[H7451]] than [[H4480]] the nations [[H1471]] the LORD [[H3068]] had destroyed [[H8045]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
10 And the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Manasseh [[H4519]] and his people, [[H5971]] but they did not [[H3808]] listen. [[H7181]] 
11 So [the LORD] [[H3068]] brought [[H935]] against them [[H5921]] the military [[H6635]] commanders [[H8269]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] who captured [[H3920]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] put a hook in his nose, [[H2336]] bound [[H631]] him with bronze shackles, [[H5178]] and took [[H1980]] him to Babylon. [[H894]] 
12 And in his distress, [[H6887]] [Manasseh] sought [[H2470]] the favor [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] and earnestly [[H3966]] humbled himself [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] the God [[H430]] of his fathers. [[H1]] 
13 And when he prayed [[H6419]] to Him, [[H413]] the LORD received his plea [[H6279]] and heard [[H8085]] his petition; [[H8467]] so He brought him back [[H7725]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and to his kingdom. [[H4438]] Then Manasseh [[H4519]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is God. [[H430]] 
14 After [[H310]] this, [[H3651]] [Manasseh] rebuilt [[H1129]] the outer [[H2435]] wall [[H2346]] of the City [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] from west [[H4628]] of Gihon [[H1521]] in the valley [[H5158]] to the entrance [[H935]] of the Fish [[H1709]] Gate, [[H8179]] and he brought it around [[H5437]] the Ophel [[H6077]] and heightened it [[H1361]] considerably. [[H3966]] He also stationed [[H7760]] military [[H2428]] commanders [[H8269]] in all [[H3605]] the fortified [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
15 He removed [[H5493]] the foreign [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] and the idol [[H5566]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] along with all [[H3605]] the altars [[H4196]] he had built [[H1129]] on the temple [[H1004]] mount [[H2022]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and he dumped [[H7993]] them outside [[H2351]] the city. [[H5892]] 
16 Then he restored [[H3559]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and sacrificed [[H2076]] peace offerings [[H8002]] and thank [[H8426]] offerings [[H2077]] on it, [[H5921]] and he told [[H559]] Judah [[H3063]] to serve [[H5647]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
17 Nevertheless, [[H61]] the people [[H5971]] still [[H5750]] sacrificed [[H2076]] at the high places, [[H1116]] but only [[H7535]] to the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]] 
18 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] along with his prayer [[H8605]] to [[H413]] his God [[H430]] and the words [[H1697]] of the seers [[H2374]] who spoke [[H1696]] to him [[H413]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] they are indeed [[H2005]] written in [[H5921]] the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
19 His prayer [[H8605]] and [how God] received his plea, [[H6279]] as well as all [[H3605]] his sin [[H2403]] and unfaithfulness, [[H4604]] and the sites [[H4725]] where [[H834]] he built [[H1129]] high places [[H1116]] and set up [[H5975]] Asherah poles [[H842]] and idols [[H6456]] before [[H6440]] he humbled himself, [[H3665]] they are indeed [[H2005]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Records [[H1697]] of the Seers. [[H2335]] 
20 And Manasseh [[H4519]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] at his palace. [[H1004]] And his son [[H1121]] Amon [[H526]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
21 Amon [[H526]] was twenty-two [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] two [[H8147]] years. [[H8141]] 
22 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Manasseh [[H4519]] had done. [[H6213]] Amon [[H526]] served [[H5647]] and sacrificed [[H2076]] to all [[H3605]] the idols [[H6456]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Manasseh [[H4519]] had made, [[H6213]] 
23 but he did not [[H3808]] humble [[H3665]] himself before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] as his father [[H1]] Manasseh [[H4519]] [had done]; [[H3665]] instead, [[H3588]] Amon [[H526]] increased [[H7235]] his guilt. [[H819]] 
24 Then the servants [of Amon] [[H5650]] conspired [[H7194]] against him [[H5921]] and killed him [[H4191]] in his palace. [[H1004]] 
25 But the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] killed [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] who had conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] King [[H4428]] Amon, [[H526]] and they made his son [[H1121]] Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
