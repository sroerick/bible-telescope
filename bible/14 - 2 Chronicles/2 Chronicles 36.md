# 2 Chronicles 36
[[2 Chronicles 35|←]] • [[Ezra 1|→]]
1 Then the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] took [[H3947]] Jehoahaz [[H3059]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] and made him king [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] in place of [[H8478]] his father. [[H1]] 
2 Jehoahaz [[H3099]] was twenty-three [[H7969]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] three [[H7969]] months. [[H2320]] 
3 And the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] dethroned him [[H5493]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and imposed [[H6064]] on [Judah] {a levy} [[H776]] of a hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] and a talent [[H3603]] of gold. [[H2091]] 
4 Then Neco king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] {made} Eliakim [[H471]] brother of Jehoahaz [[H251]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and he changed [[H5437]] Eliakim’s name [[H8034]] to Jehoiakim. [[H3079]] But Neco [[H5224]] took [[H3947]] Eliakim’s brother [[H251]] Jehoahaz [[H3099]] and carried him off [[H935]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] 
5 Jehoiakim [[H3079]] was twenty-five [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] eleven [[H259]] years. [[H8141]] And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God. [[H430]] 
6 Then Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] came up [[H5927]] against Jehoiakim [[H5921]] and bound him [[H631]] in bronze shackles [[H5178]] to take [[H1980]] him to Babylon. [[H894]] 
7 Nebuchadnezzar also [[H5019]] took [[H935]] to Babylon [[H894]] [some] of the articles [[H3627]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and he put them [[H5414]] in his temple [[H1964]] in Babylon. [[H894]] 
8 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoiakim, [[H3079]] the abominations [[H8441]] he committed, [[H6213]] and all that was found [[H4672]] against him, [[H5921]] they are indeed [[H2005]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah. [[H3063]] And his son [[H1121]] Jehoiachin [[H3078]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
9 Jehoiachin [[H3078]] was eighteen [[H8083]] years old [[H8141]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] and ten [[H6235]] days. [[H3117]] And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
10 In the spring, [[H8666]] King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] summoned [him] [[H7971]] and brought him [[H935]] to Babylon, [[H894]] along with [[H5973]] the articles [[H3627]] of value [[H2532]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and he made Jehoiachin’s relative [[H251]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
11 Zedekiah [[H6667]] was twenty-one [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] eleven [[H259]] years. [[H8141]] 
12 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] and did not [[H3808]] humble [[H3665]] himself before [[H6440]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet, [[H5030]] who spoke [[H6310]] for the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 He also [[H1571]] rebelled [[H4775]] against King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5019]] who [[H834]] had made him swear [[H7650]] by God. [[H430]] But [Zedekiah] stiffened [[H7185]] his neck [[H6203]] and hardened [[H553]] his heart [[H3824]] against turning [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
14 Furthermore, [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H8269]] of the priests [[H3548]] and the people [[H5971]] multiplied [[H7235]] their unfaithful deeds, [[H4603]] [following] all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] of the nations, [[H1471]] and they defiled [[H2930]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] He had consecrated [[H6942]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
15 Time and again [[H7925]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] sent word [[H7971]] to [His people] [[H5921]] through [[H3027]] His messengers, [[H4397]] because [[H3588]] He had compassion [[H2550]] on [[H5921]] [them] [[H5971]] and on [[H5921]] His dwelling place. [[H4583]] 
16 But they [[H1961]] mocked [[H3931]] the messengers [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] despising [[H959]] His words [[H1697]] and scoffing [[H8591]] at His prophets, [[H5030]] until [[H5704]] the wrath [[H2534]] of the LORD [[H3068]] against His people [[H5971]] was stirred up [[H5927]] beyond [[H369]] remedy. [[H4832]] 
17 So He brought up [[H5927]] against them [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] who put [[H2026]] their choice young men [[H970]] to the sword [[H2719]] in the sanctuary, [[H4720]] sparing [[H2550]] neither [[H3808]] young men [[H970]] nor young women, [[H1330]] neither elderly [[H2205]] nor infirm. [[H3486]] [God] gave [[H5414]] them all [[H3605]] into the hand [of Nebuchadnezzar]. [[H3027]] 
18 He carried off [[H935]] everything [[H3605]] to Babylon— [[H894]] all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] both large [[H1419]] and small, [[H6996]] and the treasures [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and of the king [[H4428]] and his officials. [[H8269]] 
19 Then the Chaldeans set fire to [[H8313]] the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] and broke down [[H5422]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] They burned down [[H8313]] all [[H3605]] the palaces [[H759]] and destroyed [[H7843]] everything [[H3605]] of value. [[H4261]] 
20 Those who escaped [[H7611]] the sword [[H2719]] were carried by Nebuchadnezzar into exile [[H1540]] in [[H413]] Babylon, [[H894]] and they became [[H1961]] servants [[H5650]] to him and his sons [[H1121]] until [[H5704]] the kingdom [[H4438]] of Persia [[H6539]] came to power. [[H4427]] 
21 So the land [[H776]] enjoyed [[H7521]] its Sabbath [[H7676]] rest [[H7673]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the desolation, [[H8074]] until [[H5704]] seventy [[H7657]] years [[H8141]] were completed, [[H4390]] in fulfillment [[H4390]] of the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] through [[H6310]] Jeremiah. [[H3414]] 
22 In the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia, [[H6539]] to fulfill [[H3615]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] spoken [[H6310]] through Jeremiah, [[H3414]] the LORD [[H3068]] stirred [[H5782]] the spirit [[H7307]] of Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia [[H6539]] to send [[H5674]] a proclamation [[H6963]] throughout [[H3605]] his kingdom [[H4438]] and [[H1571]] to put it in writing [[H4385]] as follows: [[H559]] 
23 “This is what [[H3541]] Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia [[H6539]] says: [[H559]] ‘The LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]] who [[H1931]] has given [[H5414]] me  all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth, [[H776]] has appointed [[H6485]] me [[H5921]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for Him  at Jerusalem [[H3389]] in Judah. [[H3063]] Whoever [[H4310]] among you  belongs to [[H3605]] His people, [[H5971]] may the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] be [[H5927]] with him. [[H5973]]
