1 Then Rehoboam [[H7346]] went [[H1980]] to Shechem, [[H7927]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] had gone [[H935]] [there] [[H7927]] to make him king. [[H4427]] 
2 When Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] heard about this, [[H8085]] [he] [[H3379]] returned [[H7725]] from Egypt, [[H4714]] where [[H834]] he had fled [[H1272]] from King [[H4428]] Solomon. [[H8010]] 
3 So they sent for [[H7971]] [Jeroboam], [[H7121]] and [he] [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] and said, [[H1696]] 
4 “Your father [[H1]] put a heavy [[H7185]] yoke [[H5923]] on us. [[H853]] But now [[H6258]] you should lighten [[H7043]] the burden [[H7186]] of your father’s [[H1]] service [[H5656]] and the heavy [[H3515]] yoke [[H5923]] he put [[H5414]] on us, [[H5921]] and we will serve you.” [[H5647]] 
5 Rehoboam answered, [[H559]] “Come back [[H7725]] to me [[H413]] in [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] days.” [[H3117]] So the people [[H5971]] departed. [[H1980]] 
6 Then King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] consulted [[H3289]] with [[H854]] the elders [[H2205]] who [[H834]] had served [[H5975]] his father [[H1]] Solomon [[H8010]] during [[H1961]] his lifetime. [[H2416]] “How [[H349]] do you [[H859]] advise [[H3289]] me to respond [[H7725]] to these [[H2088]] people?” [[H5971]] he asked. [[H559]] 
7 They replied, [[H1696]] “If [[H518]] you will be [[H1961]] kind [[H2896]] to these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] and please them [[H7521]] by speaking [[H1696]] kind [[H2896]] words [[H1697]] to them, [[H413]] they will be [[H1961]] your servants [[H5650]] forever.” [[H3605]] 
8 But [Rehoboam] rejected [[H5800]] the advice [[H6098]] of the elders; [[H2205]] instead, he consulted [[H3289]] the young men [[H3206]] who [[H834]] had grown up [[H1431]] with him [[H854]] and served [[H5975]] him. [[H6440]] 
9 He asked [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “What [[H4100]] message [[H1697]] do you [[H859]] advise [[H3289]] that we send back [[H7725]] to these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] have spoken [[H1696]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Lighten [[H7043]] the yoke [[H5923]] your father [[H1]] put [[H5414]] on us’?” [[H5921]] 
10 The young men [[H3206]] who [[H834]] had grown up [[H1431]] with him [[H854]] replied, [[H1696]] “This is how [[H3541]] you should answer [[H559]] these people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] said [[H1696]] to you, [[H413]] ‘Your father [[H1]] made our yoke [[H5923]] heavy, [[H3513]] but you [[H859]] should make it lighter.’ [[H7043]] This is what [[H3541]] you should tell [[H559]] them: [[H413]] ‘My little finger [[H6995]] is thicker [[H5666]] than my father’s [[H1]] waist! [[H4975]] 
11 Although [[H6258]] my father [[H1]] burdened [[H6006]] you with a heavy [[H3515]] yoke, [[H5923]] I [[H589]] will add [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] your yoke. [[H5923]] Although my father [[H1]] scourged [[H3256]] you [[H853]] with whips, [[H7752]] I [will scourge you] [[H589]] with scorpions.’” [[H6137]] 
12 After three [[H7992]] days, [[H3117]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam, [[H7346]] since [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] had said, [[H559]] “Come back [[H7725]] to me [[H413]] on the third [[H7992]] day.” [[H3117]] 
13 And the king [[H4428]] answered them [[H6030]] harshly. [[H7186]] King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] rejected [[H5800]] the advice [[H6098]] of the elders [[H2205]] 
14 and spoke [[H1696]] to them [[H413]] as the young men [[H3206]] had advised, [[H6098]] saying, [[H559]] “Although my father made your yoke [[H5923]] heavy, [[H3513]] I [[H589]] will add [[H3254]] to it. [[H5921]] Although my father [[H1]] scourged [[H3256]] you [[H853]] with whips, [[H7752]] I [will scourge you] [[H589]] with scorpions!” [[H6137]] 
15 So the king [[H4428]] did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] and indeed [[H3588]] this turn of events [[H5252]] was [[H1961]] from [[H5973]] God, [[H430]] in order that [[H4616]] the LORD [[H3068]] might fulfill [[H6965]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] He had spoken [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] Ahijah [[H281]] the Shilonite [[H7888]] to [[H413]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat. [[H5028]] 
16 When all [[H3605]] Israel [saw] [[H3478]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] had refused [[H3808]] to listen [[H8085]] to them, [[H5971]] they answered [[H7725]] the king: [[H4428]] “What [[H4100]] portion [[H2506]] do we have  in David, [[H1732]] and what [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] in the son [[H1121]] of Jesse? [[H3448]] To your tents, [[H168]] O Israel! [[H3478]] Look [[H7200]] now [[H1004]] to your own house, [[H6258]] O David! [[H1732]] So all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] home, [[H168]] 
17 but Rehoboam [[H7346]] still reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] the Israelites [[H1121]] living [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
18 Then King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] sent out [[H7971]] Hadoram, [[H1913]] who [[H834]] was in charge [[H5921]] of the labor force, [[H4522]] but the Israelites [[H1121]] stoned [[H7275]] him to death. [[H4191]] And King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] mounted [[H5927]] his chariot [[H4818]] in haste [[H553]] and escaped [[H5127]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
19 So to [[H5704]] this [[H3117]] day [[H2088]] Israel [[H3478]] has been in rebellion [[H6586]] against the house [[H1004]] of David. [[H1732]]
