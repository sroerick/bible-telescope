1 Then in the seventh [[H7637]] year, [[H8141]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] strengthened himself [[H2388]] and made [[H3947]] a covenant [[H1285]] with the commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds: [[H3967]] Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Jeroham, [[H3395]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Jehohanan, [[H3076]] Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Obed, [[H5744]] Maaseiah [[H4641]] son [[H1121]] of Adaiah, [[H5718]] and Elishaphat [[H478]] son [[H1121]] of Zichri. [[H2147]] 
2 So they went throughout [[H5437]] Judah [[H3063]] and gathered [[H6908]] the Levites [[H3881]] from all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the heads [[H7218]] of the families [[H1]] of Israel. [[H3478]] And when they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] 
3 the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] in the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]] “Behold, [[H2009]] the king's [[H4428]] son!” [[H1121]] said Jehoiada. [[H559]] “He must reign, [[H4427]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] promised [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] the descendants [[H1121]] of David. [[H1732]] 
4 This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] you are to do: [[H6213]] A third [[H7992]] of you [[H4480]] priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] who come on duty [[H935]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] shall keep watch [[H7778]] at the doors, [[H5592]] 
5 a third [[H7992]] shall be at the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and a third [[H7992]] at the Foundation [[H3247]] Gate, [[H8179]] while all [[H3605]] the others [[H5971]] are in the courtyards [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
6 No [[H408]] one is to enter [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] except [[H3588]] the priests [[H3548]] and those Levites [[H3881]] who serve; [[H8334]] they [[H1992]] may enter [[H935]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are consecrated, [[H6944]] but all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] are to obey [[H8104]] the requirement [[H4931]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 The Levites [[H3881]] must surround [[H5362]] the king [[H4428]] with weapons [[H3627]] in hand, [[H3027]] and anyone who enters [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] must be put to death. [[H4191]] You must stay [[H1961]] close [[H854]] to the king [[H4428]] wherever he goes.” [[H935]] 
8 So the commanders of hundreds did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] had ordered. [[H6680]] Each of them [[H376]] took [[H3947]] his men— [[H376]] those coming on duty [[H935]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] and [[H5973]] those going off duty— [[H3318]] for [[H3588]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] had not [[H3808]] released [any of] [[H6362]] the divisions. [[H4256]] 
9 Then Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] gave [[H5414]] to the commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] the spears [[H2595]] and the large [[H4043]] and [[H853]] small shields [[H7982]] of King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] that [[H834]] were in the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]] 
10 He stationed [[H5975]] all [[H3605]] the troops, [[H5971]] with their weapons [[H7973]] in hand, [[H3027]] surrounding [[H5439]] the king [[H4428]] by the altar [[H4196]] and the temple, [[H1004]] from the south [[H3233]] side [[H3802]] to [[H5704]] the north [[H8042]] side [[H3802]] of the temple. [[H1004]] 
11 Then [Jehoiada and his sons] brought out [[H3318]] the king’s [[H4428]] son, [[H1121]] put [[H5414]] the crown [[H5145]] on him, [[H5921]] presented him with the Testimony, [[H5715]] and proclaimed him king. [[H4427]] [They] [[H3077]] anointed him [[H4886]] and shouted, [[H559]] “Long live [[H2421]] the king!” [[H4428]] 
12 When Athaliah [[H6271]] heard [[H8085]] the noise [[H6963]] of the people [[H5971]] running [[H7323]] and cheering [[H1984]] the king, [[H4428]] she went out [[H935]] to [[H413]] [them] [[H5971]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 And she looked out [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] the king, [[H4428]] standing [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] his pillar [[H5982]] at the entrance. [[H3996]] The officers [[H8269]] and trumpeters [[H2689]] were beside [[H5921]] the king, [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] were rejoicing [[H8055]] and blowing [[H8628]] trumpets, [[H2689]] while the singers [[H7891]] with musical [[H7892]] instruments [[H3627]] were leading [[H3045]] the praises. [[H1984]] Then Athaliah [[H6271]] tore [[H7167]] her clothes [[H899]] and screamed, [[H559]] Treason, [[H7195]] treason! [[H7195]] 
14 And Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] sent out [[H3318]] the commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] in charge of [[H6485]] the army, [[H2428]] saying, [[H559]] “Bring her out [[H3318]] between [[H1004]] the ranks, [[H7713]] and put to [[H4191]] the sword [[H2719]] anyone who follows [[H935]] her.” [[H310]] For [[H3588]] the priest [[H3548]] had said, [[H559]] “She must not [[H3808]] be put to death [[H4191]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
15 So they seized [[H7760]] [Athaliah] [[H3027]] as she reached [[H935]] the entrance [[H3996]] of the Horse [[H5483]] Gate [[H8179]] to the palace grounds, [[H4428]] and there [[H8033]] they put her to death. [[H4191]] 
16 Then Jehoiada [[H3077]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] between himself, [[H996]] the king, [[H4428]] and the people [[H5971]] that they would be [[H1961]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] people. [[H5971]] 
17 So all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] went [[H935]] to the temple [[H1004]] of Baal [[H1168]] and tore it down. [[H5422]] They smashed the altars [[H4196]] and idols [[H6754]] into pieces [[H7665]] and killed [[H2026]] Mattan [[H4977]] the priest [[H3548]] of Baal [[H1168]] in front of [[H6440]] the altars. [[H4196]] 
18 Moreover, Jehoiada [[H3077]] put [[H7760]] the oversight [[H6486]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the Levitical [[H3881]] priests, [[H3548]] whom [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had appointed [[H2505]] over [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the LORD [[H3068]] as is written [[H3789]] in the Law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] with rejoicing [[H8057]] and song, [[H7892]] as ordained [[H3027]] by David. [[H1732]] 
19 He stationed [[H5975]] gatekeepers [[H7778]] at [[H5921]] the gates [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] so that nothing [[H3808]] unclean [[H2931]] could enter [[H935]] for any [[H3605]] reason. [[H1697]] 
20 He also took with him [[H3947]] the commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] the nobles, [[H117]] the rulers [[H4910]] of the people, [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] and they brought the king [[H4428]] down [[H3381]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and entered [[H935]] the royal [[H4428]] palace [[H1004]] through [[H8432]] the Upper [[H5945]] Gate. [[H8179]] They seated [[H3427]] King [Joash] [[H4428]] on [[H5921]] the royal [[H4467]] throne, [[H3678]] 
21 and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] rejoiced. [[H8055]] And the city [[H5892]] was quiet, [[H8252]] because Athaliah [[H6271]] had been put to [[H4191]] the sword. [[H2719]]
