1 Then Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] [them] [[H1]] in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And his son [[H1121]] Jehoram [[H3088]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
2 Jehoram's brothers, [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] [were] Azariah, [[H5838]] Jehiel, [[H3171]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] Azariah, [[H5838]] Michael, [[H4317]] and Shephatiah; [[H8203]] these [were] [[H428]] all [[H3605]] sons [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
3 Their father [[H1]] had given [[H5414]] them many [[H7227]] gifts [[H4979]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] and precious things, [[H4030]] as well as [[H5973]] the fortified [[H4694]] cities [[H5892]] in Judah; [[H3063]] but [[H853]] he gave [[H5414]] the kingdom [[H4467]] to Jehoram [[H3088]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was the firstborn. [[H1060]] 
4 When Jehoram [[H3088]] had established [[H6965]] himself over [[H5921]] his father’s [[H1]] kingdom, [[H4467]] he strengthened himself [[H2388]] by putting [[H2026]] to the sword [[H2719]] all [[H3605]] his brothers [[H251]] along with [[H1571]] [some] of the princes [[H8269]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
5 Jehoram [[H3088]] [was] thirty-two [[H7970]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] eight [[H8083]] years. [[H8141]] 
6 And [Jehoram] walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] just as [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] had done. [[H6213]] For [[H3588]] he  married [[H802]] a daughter [[H1323]] of Ahab [[H256]] and did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 Yet the LORD [[H3068]] was unwilling [[H3808]] to destroy [[H7843]] the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] because of [[H4616]] the covenant [[H1285]] He had made [[H3772]] with David, [[H1732]] and since [[H834]] He had promised [[H559]] to maintain [[H5414]] a lamp [[H5216]] for David  and his descendants [[H1121]] forever. [[H3605]] 
8 In the days of Jehoram, [[H3117]] Edom [[H123]] rebelled [[H6586]] against [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Judah [[H3063]] and appointed [[H4427]] their own [[H5921]] king. [[H4428]] 
9 So Jehoram [[H3088]] crossed [[H5674]] into Edom [[H5973]] with his officers [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] his chariots. [[H7393]] When the Edomites [[H123]] surrounded [[H5437]] him [[H413]] and [[H853]] his chariot [[H7393]] commanders, [[H8269]] he rose up [[H6965]] and attacked [[H5221]] by night. [[H3915]] 
10 So to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] Edom [[H123]] has been in rebellion [[H6586]] against [[H8478]] the hand of [[H3027]] Judah. [[H3063]] Likewise, [[H227]] Libnah [[H3841]] rebelled [[H6586]] against [[H8478]] his rule [[H3027]] at the same [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] because [[H3588]] he had abandoned [[H5800]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of his fathers. [[H1]] 
11 Jehoram [[H1931]] had also [[H1571]] built [[H6213]] high places [[H1116]] on the hills [[H2022]] of Judah; [[H3063]] he had caused the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] to prostitute themselves [[H2181]] and had led Judah [[H3063]] astray. [[H5080]] 
12 Then a letter [[H4385]] came [[H935]] to [Jehoram] [[H413]] from Elijah [[H452]] the prophet, [[H5030]] which stated: [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] says: [[H559]] ‘You have not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of your father [[H1]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] [or] [[H1870]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] 
13 but you have walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and have caused Judah [[H3063]] and the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] to prostitute themselves [[H2181]] just as the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] prostituted itself. [[H2181]] You have also [[H1571]] killed [[H2026]] your brothers, [[H251]] your father’s [[H1]] family, [[H1004]] who were better [[H2896]] than you. [[H4480]] 
14 So behold, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] is about to strike [[H5062]] your people, [[H5971]] your sons, [[H1121]] your wives, [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] your possessions [[H7399]] with a serious [[H1419]] blow. [[H4046]] 
15 And day [[H3117]] after [[H5921]] day [[H3117]] you yourself [[H859]] will suffer from a severe [[H7227]] illness, [[H2483]] a disease [[H4245]] of your bowels, [[H4578]] until [[H5704]] [it] [[H2483]] causes [[H4480]] your bowels [[H4578]] to come out.’” [[H3318]] 
16 Then the LORD [[H3068]] stirred [[H5782]] against Jehoram [[H3088]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] and of the Arabs [[H6163]] who [[H834]] lived near [[H5921]] the Cushites. [[H3569]] 
17 So they went to war [[H5927]] against Judah, [[H3063]] invaded it, [[H1234]] and carried off [[H7617]] all [[H3605]] the possessions [[H7399]] found [[H4672]] in the king’s [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] along with [[H1571]] his sons [[H1121]] and wives; [[H802]] not [[H3808]] a son [[H1121]] was left [[H7604]] to him except [[H3588]] Jehoahaz, [[H3059]] his youngest. [[H6996]] 
18 After [[H310]] all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] the LORD [[H3068]] afflicted [Jehoram] [[H5062]] with an incurable [[H369]] disease [[H2483]] of the bowels. [[H4578]] 
19 This continued [[H1961]] day [[H3117]] after day [[H3117]] until two [[H8147]] full years [[H3117]] passed. [[H3318]] Finally, [[H7093]] his intestines [[H4578]] came out [[H3318]] because of [[H5973]] his disease, [[H2483]] and he died [[H4191]] in severe [[H7451]] pain. [[H8463]] And his people [[H5971]] did not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] a fire [[H8316]] in his honor  as they had done [[H8316]] for his fathers. [[H1]] 
20 Jehoram was [[H1961]] thirty-two [[H7970]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] eight [[H8083]] years. [[H8141]] He died, [[H1980]] to no [[H3808]] one’s regret, [[H2532]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] but not [[H3808]] in the tombs [[H6913]] of the kings.
