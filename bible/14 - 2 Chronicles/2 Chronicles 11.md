1 When Rehoboam [[H7346]] arrived [[H935]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] he mobilized [[H6950]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin— [[H1144]] 180,000 {} [[H3967]] choice [[H970]] warriors— [[H4421]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Israel [[H3478]] and restore [[H7725]] the kingdom [[H4467]] to Rehoboam. [[H7346]] 
2 But the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3069]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the man [[H376]] of God: [[H430]] 
3 “Tell [[H559]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] son [[H1121]] of Solomon [[H8010]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] in Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] 
4 that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘You are not [[H3808]] to go up [[H5927]] and fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] your brothers. [[H251]] Each [[H376]] of you must return [[H7725]] home, [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] is [[H1961]] from Me.’” [[H853]] So they listened [[H8085]] to the words [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and turned back [[H7725]] from going [[H1980]] against [[H413]] Jeroboam. [[H3379]] 
5 Rehoboam [[H7346]] continued to live [[H3427]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and he built up [[H1129]] cities [[H5892]] for defense [[H4692]] in Judah. [[H3063]] 
6 He built up [[H1129]] Bethlehem, [[H1035]] Etam, [[H5862]] Tekoa, [[H8620]] 
7 Beth-zur, [[H1049]] Soco, [[H7755]] Adullam, [[H5725]] 
8 Gath, [[H1661]] Mareshah, [[H4762]] Ziph, [[H2128]] 
9 Adoraim, [[H115]] Lachish, [[H3923]] Azekah, [[H5825]] 
10 Zorah, [[H6881]] Aijalon, [[H357]] and Hebron, [[H2275]] the fortified [[H4694]] cities [[H5892]] in Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin. [[H1144]] 
11 He strengthened [[H2388]] their fortresses [[H4694]] and put [[H5414]] officers [[H5057]] in them,  with supplies [[H214]] of food, [[H3978]] oil, [[H8081]] and wine. [[H3196]] 
12 He also put shields [[H6793]] and spears [[H7420]] in all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] and strengthened [[H2388]] them greatly. [[H7235]] So Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] belonged to him. [[H1961]] 
13 Moreover, the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] from [[H834]] all [[H3605]] their districts [[H1366]] throughout [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] stood [[H3320]] with Rehoboam. [[H5921]] 
14 For [[H3588]] the Levites [[H3881]] left [[H5800]] their pasturelands [[H4054]] and their possessions [[H272]] and went [[H1980]] to Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] because [[H3588]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] and his sons [[H1121]] had rejected them [[H2186]] as priests [[H3547]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 And Jeroboam appointed [[H5975]] his own  priests [[H3548]] for the high places [[H1116]] and for the goat-demons [[H8163]] and calf idols [[H5695]] he had made. [[H6213]] 
16 Those from every [[H3605]] tribe [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] who had set [[H5414]] their hearts [[H3824]] to seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3068]] their [[H3478]] God [[H430]] followed [the Levites] [[H310]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
17 So they strengthened [[H2388]] the kingdom [[H4438]] of Judah [[H3063]] and supported [[H553]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] son [[H1121]] of Solomon [[H8010]] for three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] because [[H3588]] they walked [[H1980]] for three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] in the way [[H1870]] of David [[H1732]] and Solomon. [[H8010]] 
18 And Rehoboam [[H7346]] married [[H3947]] Mahalath, [[H4258]] [who was] the daughter [[H1121]] of David’s [[H1732]] son [[H1121]] Jerimoth [[H1323]] and of Abihail, [[H32]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Jesse’s [[H3448]] son [[H1121]] Eliab. [[H446]] 
19 She bore [[H3205]] sons to him: [[H1121]] Jeush, [[H3266]] Shemariah, [[H8114]] and Zaham. [[H2093]] 
20 After her, [[H310]] he married [[H3947]] Maacah [[H4601]] daughter [[H1323]] of Absalom, [[H53]] and she bore [[H3205]] to him  Abijah, [[H29]] Attai, [[H6262]] Ziza, [[H2124]] and Shelomith. [[H8019]] 
21 Rehoboam [[H7346]] loved [[H157]] Maacah [[H4601]] daughter [[H1323]] of Absalom [[H53]] more than all [[H3605]] his wives [[H802]] and concubines. [[H6370]] In all, he had [[H5375]] eighteen [[H8083]] wives [[H802]] and sixty [[H8346]] concubines, [[H6370]] and he was the father [[H3205]] of twenty-eight [[H6242]] sons [[H1121]] and sixty [[H8346]] daughters. [[H1323]] 
22 Rehoboam [[H7346]] appointed [[H5975]] Abijah [[H29]] son [[H1121]] of Maacah [[H4601]] as chief [[H7218]] prince [[H5057]] among his brothers, [[H251]] intending to make him king. [[H4427]] 
23 Rehoboam also acted wisely [[H995]] by dispersing [[H6555]] some of his sons [[H1121]] throughout [[H3605]] the districts [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] and to all [[H3605]] the fortified [[H4694]] cities. [[H5892]] He gave [[H5414]] them  abundant [[H7230]] provisions [[H4202]] and sought [[H7592]] many [[H1995]] wives for them. [[H802]]
