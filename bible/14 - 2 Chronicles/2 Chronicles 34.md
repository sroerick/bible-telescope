1 Josiah [[H2977]] was eight [[H8083]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] thirty-one [[H7970]] years. [[H8141]] 
2 And he did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and walked [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of his father [[H1]] David; [[H1732]] he did not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left. [[H8040]] 
3 In the eighth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] while he [[H1931]] was still [[H5750]] young, [[H5288]] Josiah began [[H2490]] to seek [[H1875]] the God [[H430]] of David [[H1732]] his forefather, [[H1]] and in the twelfth [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] he began [[H2490]] to cleanse [[H2891]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] of [[H4480]] the high places, [[H1116]] the Asherah poles, [[H842]] the carved idols, [[H6456]] and the cast images. [[H4541]] 
4 Then in his presence [[H6440]] the altars [[H4196]] of the Baals [[H1168]] were torn down, [[H5422]] and he cut to pieces the incense altars [[H2553]] that [[H834]] were above [[H4605]] them. [[H5921]] He shattered [[H7665]] the Asherah poles, [[H842]] the carved idols, [[H6456]] and the cast images, [[H4541]] crushed them to dust, [[H1854]] and scattered [[H2236]] them over [[H5921]] the graves [[H6913]] of those who had sacrificed [[H2076]] to them.  
5 Then he burned [[H8313]] the bones [[H6106]] of the priests [[H3548]] on [[H5921]] their altars. [[H4196]] So he cleansed [[H2891]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
6 [Josiah] did the same in the cities [[H5892]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and Simeon, [[H8095]] as [[H5704]] far as Naphtali, [[H5321]] and on their surrounding [[H5439]] ruins. [[H1004]] 
7 He tore down [[H5422]] the altars [[H4196]] and Asherah poles, [[H842]] crushed [[H3807]] the idols [[H6456]] to powder, [[H1854]] and cut to pieces [[H1438]] all [[H3605]] the incense altars [[H2553]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Then he returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
8 Now in the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] in order to cleanse [[H2891]] the land [[H776]] and the temple, [[H1004]] Josiah sent [[H7971]] Shaphan [[H8227]] son [[H1121]] of Azaliah, [[H683]] Maaseiah [[H4641]] the governor [[H8269]] of the city, [[H5892]] and [[H853]] Joah [[H3098]] son [[H1121]] of Joahaz, [[H3099]] the recorder, [[H2142]] to repair [[H2388]] the temple [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God. [[H430]] 
9 So they went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] and gave [[H5414]] him [[H853]] the money [[H3701]] that had been brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] the Levites [[H3881]] [at] [[H8104]] the doors [[H5592]] had collected [[H622]] from the [people] [[H3027]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] and Ephraim, [[H669]] from all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Judah, [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] and from the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
10 They put it [[H5414]] into [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of the supervisors [[H6485]] of those doing [[H6213]] the work [[H4399]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] who in turn gave [[H5414]] it [[H853]] to the workmen [[H6213]] restoring [[H918]] and repairing [[H2388]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 They also gave [money] [[H5414]] to the carpenters [[H2796]] and builders [[H1129]] to buy [[H7069]] dressed [[H4274]] stone, [[H68]] as well as timbers [[H6086]] for couplings [[H4226]] and beams [[H7136]] for the buildings [[H1004]] that [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had allowed to deteriorate. [[H7843]] 
12 And the men [[H582]] did [[H6213]] the work [[H4399]] faithfully. [[H530]] The Levites [[H3881]] overseeing them [[H6485]] were Jahath [[H3189]] and Obadiah, [[H5662]] descendants [[H1121]] of Merari, [[H4847]] and Zechariah [[H2148]] and Meshullam [[H4918]] descendants [[H1121]] of Kohath. [[H6956]] [Other] Levites, [[H3881]] all [[H3605]] skilled [[H995]] with musical [[H7892]] instruments, [[H3627]] 
13 were over [[H5921]] the laborers [[H5449]] and supervised [[H5329]] all [[H3605]] who did [[H6213]] the work, [[H4399]] task [[H5656]] by task. [[H5656]] Some of the Levites [[H3881]] were secretaries, [[H5608]] officers, [[H7860]] and gatekeepers. [[H7778]] 
14 While they were bringing out [[H3318]] the money [[H3701]] that had been taken [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest [[H3548]] found [[H4672]] the book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [given] by [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
15 And Hilkiah [[H2518]] said to [[H6030]] Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] “I have found [[H4672]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD!” [[H3068]] And he [[H2518]] gave [[H5414]] [it] [[H5612]] to [[H413]] Shaphan. [[H8227]] 
16 Shaphan [[H8227]] took [[H935]] the book [[H5612]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] and [[H5750]] reported, [[H7725]] “Your servants [[H5650]] are doing [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] has been placed [[H5414]] in their hands. [[H3027]] 
17 They have paid out [[H5413]] the money [[H3701]] that was found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and have put [[H5414]] it into [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of the supervisors [[H6485]] [and] [[H3027]] workers.” [[H4399]] 
18 Moreover, Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe [[H5608]] told [[H5046]] the king, [[H4428]] “Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest [[H3548]] has given [[H5414]] me  a book.” [[H5612]] And Shaphan [[H8227]] read [[H7121]] it  in the presence [[H6440]] of the king. [[H4428]] 
19 When the king [[H4428]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the Law, [[H8451]] he tore [[H7167]] his clothes [[H899]] 
20 [and] [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Hilkiah, [[H2518]] Ahikam [[H296]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] Abdon [[H5658]] son [[H1121]] of Micah, [[H4318]] Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Asaiah [[H6222]] the servant [[H5650]] of the king: [[H4428]] 
21 “Go [[H1980]] and inquire [[H1875]] of the LORD [[H3068]] for me, [[H1157]] and for [[H1157]] those remaining [[H7604]] in Israel [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] concerning [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] in the book [[H5612]] that [[H834]] that has been found. [[H4672]] For [[H3588]] great [is] [[H1419]] the wrath [[H2534]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] has been poured out [[H5413]] on us  because [[H5921]] our fathers [[H1]] have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] by doing [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] book. [[H5612]] 
22 So Hilkiah [[H2518]] and those [[H834]] the king [had designated] [[H4428]] went [[H1980]] and spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Huldah [[H2468]] the prophetess, [[H5031]] the wife [[H802]] of Shallum [[H7967]] son [[H1121]] of Tokhath, [[H8445]] the son [[H1121]] of Hasrah, [[H2641]] the keeper [[H8104]] of the wardrobe. [[H899]] She [[H1931]] lived [[H3427]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] in the Second District. [[H4932]] 
23 And [Huldah] said [[H559]] to them,  “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Tell [[H559]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] sent [[H7971]] you [[H853]] 
24 that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] I am about to bring [[H935]] calamity [[H7451]] on [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and on [[H5921]] its people, [[H3427]] according to all [[H3605]] the curses [[H423]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] that [[H834]] has been read [[H7121]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] 
25 because [[H8478]] they have forsaken Me [[H5800]] and burned incense [[H6999]] to other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] that [[H4616]] they might provoke Me to anger [[H3707]] with all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] of their hands. [[H3027]] My wrath [[H2534]] will be poured out [[H5413]] upon this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and will not [[H3808]] be quenched.’ [[H3518]] 
26 But as for [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] who sent [[H7971]] you [[H853]] to inquire [[H1875]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] tell him [[H559]] that [[H3541]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘As for the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] you heard, [[H8085]] 
27 because [[H3282]] your heart [[H3824]] was tender [[H7401]] and you humbled yourself [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] God [[H430]] when you heard [[H8085]] His words [[H1697]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and against [[H5921]] its people, [[H3427]] and because you have humbled yourself [[H3665]] before Me [[H6440]] and you have torn [[H7167]] your clothes [[H899]] and wept [[H1058]] before Me, [[H6440]] I [[H589]] have heard [you], [[H8085]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
28 ‘Now I will indeed [[H2005]] gather [[H622]] you to [[H413]] your fathers, [[H1]] and you will be gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] your grave [[H6913]] in peace. [[H7965]] Your eyes [[H5869]] will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the calamity [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] will bring [[H935]] on [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and on [[H5921]] its inhabitants. [[H3427]] So they brought [[H7725]] her answer [[H1697]] back to the king. [[H4428]] 
29 Then the king [[H4428]] summoned [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
30 And [he] [[H4428]] went up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] and the people [[H3427]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] as well as the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites— [[H3881]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] small [[H6996]] and [[H5704]] great— [[H1419]] and in their hearing [[H241]] he read [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the Book [[H5612]] of the Covenant [[H1285]] that had been found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
31 So the king [[H4428]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the pillar [[H5977]] and made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] to follow [[H1980]] the LORD [[H3068]] and to keep [[H8104]] His commandments, [[H4687]] decrees, [[H5715]] and statutes [[H2706]] with all [[H3605]] his heart [[H3824]] and all [[H3605]] his soul, [[H5315]] and to carry out [[H6213]] the words [[H1697]] of this covenant [[H1285]] that were written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] book. [[H5612]] 
32 Then he had everyone [[H3605]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] take a stand in agreement to it. [[H5975]] So all the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] carried out [[H6213]] the covenant [[H1285]] of God, [[H430]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
33 And Josiah [[H2977]] removed [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] from all [[H3605]] the lands [[H776]] belonging to the Israelites, [[H1121]] and he required everyone [[H3605]] in Israel [[H3478]] to serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]] Throughout [[H3605]] his reign [[H3117]] they did not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] from following [[H310]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]
