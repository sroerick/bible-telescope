1 He made [[H6213]] a bronze [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]] 
2 He also made [[H6213]] the Sea [[H3220]] of cast metal. [[H3332]] [It was] circular in shape, [[H5696]] measuring ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] from rim [[H8193]] to [[H413]] [rim], [[H8193]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] in height, [[H6967]] and thirty [[H7970]] cubits [[H520]] in circumference. [[H6957]] 
3 Below [the rim], [[H8478]] figures [[H1823]] of oxen [[H1241]] encircled [[H5439]] it, [[H853]] ten [[H6235]] per cubit [[H520]] all the way [[H5362]] around [[H5439]] the Sea, [[H3220]] cast [[H3332]] in two [[H8147]] rows [[H2905]] as a part of [the Sea]. [[H4166]] 
4 [The Sea] stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] twelve [[H8147]] oxen, [[H1241]] three [[H7969]] facing [[H6437]] north, [[H6828]] three [[H7969]] facing [[H6437]] west, [[H3220]] three [[H7969]] facing [[H6437]] south, [[H5045]] and three [[H7969]] facing [[H6437]] east. [[H4217]] [The Sea] [[H3220]] rested on them [[H5921]] with all [[H3605]] their hindquarters [[H268]] toward the center. [[H1004]] 
5 It was a handbreadth [[H2947]] thick, [[H5672]] and its rim [[H8193]] was fashioned [[H4639]] like the brim [[H8193]] of a cup, [[H3563]] like a lily [[H7799]] blossom. [[H6525]] It could hold [[H3557]] three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] baths. [[H1324]] 
6 He also made [[H6213]] ten [[H6235]] basins [[H3595]] for washing [[H7364]] and placed [[H5414]] five [[H2568]] on the south side [[H3225]] and five [[H2568]] on the north. [[H8040]] The parts [[H4639]] of the burnt offering [[H5930]] were rinsed in them, [[H1740]] but the priests [used] [[H3548]] the Sea [[H3220]] for washing. [[H7364]] 
7 He made [[H6213]] ten [[H6235]] gold [[H2091]] lampstands [[H4501]] according to their specifications [[H4941]] and placed [them] [[H5414]] in the temple, [[H1964]] five [[H2568]] on the south side [[H3225]] and five [[H2568]] on the north. [[H8040]] 
8 Additionally, he made [[H6213]] ten [[H6235]] tables [[H7979]] and placed [them] [[H3240]] in the temple, [[H1964]] five [[H2568]] on the south side [[H3225]] and five [[H2568]] on the north. [[H8040]] He also made [[H6213]] a hundred [[H3967]] gold [[H2091]] sprinkling bowls. [[H4219]] 
9 He made [[H6213]] the courtyard [[H2691]] of the priests [[H3548]] and the large [[H1419]] court [[H5835]] and doors [[H1817]] for the court, [[H5835]] and he overlaid [[H6823]] the doors [[H1817]] with bronze. [[H5178]] 
10 He put [[H5414]] the Sea [[H3220]] on the south [[H3233]] side, [[H3802]] at the southeast corner. [[H6924]] 
11 In addition, Huram [[H2361]] made [[H6213]] the pots, [[H5518]] shovels, [[H3257]] and sprinkling bowls. [[H4219]] So Huram  finished [[H3615]] the work [[H4399]] that [[H834]] he had undertaken [[H6213]] for King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] in the house [[H1004]] of God: [[H430]] 
12 the two [[H8147]] pillars; [[H5982]] the two [[H8147]] bowl-shaped [[H1543]] capitals [[H3805]] atop [[H7218]] the pillars; [[H5982]] the two [[H8147]] sets of network [[H7639]] covering [[H3680]] both [[H8147]] bowls [[H1543]] of the capitals [[H3805]] atop [[H7218]] the pillars; [[H5982]] 
13 the four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] pomegranates [[H7416]] for the two [[H8147]] sets of network [[H7639]] (two [[H8147]] rows [[H2905]] of pomegranates [[H7416]] for each [[H259]] network [[H7639]] covering [[H3680]] both [[H8147]] the bowl-shaped [[H1543]] capitals [[H3805]] atop [[H6440]] the pillars); [[H5982]] 
14 the stands; [[H4350]] the basins [[H3595]] on [[H5921]] the stands; [[H4350]] 
15 the Sea; [[H3220]] the twelve [[H8147]] oxen [[H1241]] underneath [the Sea]; [[H8478]] 
16 and [[H853]] the pots, [[H5518]] shovels, [[H3257]] meat forks, [[H4207]] and all [[H3605]] the other articles. [[H3627]] [All these objects that] Huram-abi [[H2361]] made [[H6213]] for King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3069]] were of polished [[H4838]] bronze. [[H5178]] 
17 The king [[H4428]] had them cast [[H3332]] in clay molds [[H127]] in the plain [[H3603]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] between [[H996]] Succoth [[H5523]] and Zeredah. [[H6868]] 
18 Solomon [[H8010]] made [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] articles [[H3627]] in such great abundance [[H7230]] that [[H3588]] the weight [[H4948]] of the bronze [[H5178]] could not [[H3808]] be determined. [[H2713]] 
19 Solomon [[H8010]] also made [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the furnishings [[H3627]] for [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of God: [[H430]] the golden [[H2091]] altar; [[H4196]] the tables [[H7979]] on which was placed [[H5921]] the Bread [[H3899]] of the Presence; [[H6440]] 
20 the lampstands [[H4501]] of pure [[H5462]] gold [[H2091]] and their lamps, [[H5216]] to burn [[H1197]] in front [[H6440]] of the inner sanctuary [[H1687]] as prescribed; [[H4941]] 
21 the flowers, [[H6525]] lamps, [[H5216]] and tongs [[H4457]] of gold— [[H2091]] of purest [[H4357]] gold; [[H2091]] 
22 the wick trimmers, [[H4212]] sprinkling basins, [[H4219]] ladles, [[H3709]] and censers [[H4289]] of purest [[H5462]] gold; [[H2091]] and the gold [[H2091]] doors [[H6607]] of the temple: [[H1004]] the inner [[H6442]] doors [[H1817]] to the Most Holy Place [[H6944]] as well as the doors [[H1817]] of the main hall.
