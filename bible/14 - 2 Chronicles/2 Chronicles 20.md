1 After this, [[H310]] the Moabites [[H1121]] and Ammonites, [[H1121]] together with [[H5973]] some of the Meunites, [[H5984]] came [[H935]] to make war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] Jehoshaphat. [[H3092]] 
2 Then some men came [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] “A vast [[H7227]] army [[H1995]] is coming [[H935]] against you [[H5921]] from Edom, [[H758]] from beyond [[H5676]] the Sea; [[H3220]] they are already [[H2009]] in Hazazon-tamar” [[H2688]] (that is, [[H1931]] En-gedi). [[H5872]] 
3 Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] was alarmed [[H3372]] and set [[H5414]] his face [[H6440]] to seek [[H1875]] the LORD. [[H3068]] And he proclaimed [[H7121]] a fast [[H6685]] throughout [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]] 
4 So [the people of] Judah [[H3063]] gathered [[H6908]] to seek [[H1245]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and indeed, [[H1571]] they came [[H935]] from all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] to seek [[H1245]] Him. [[H3068]] 
5 Then Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] stood [[H5975]] in the assembly [[H6951]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] in front of [[H6440]] the new [[H2319]] courtyard [[H2691]] 
6 and said, [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of our fathers, [[H1]] are You [[H859]] not [[H3808]] the God [[H430]] who is in heaven, [[H8064]] and do You [[H859]] not rule [[H4910]] over all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the nations? [[H1471]] Power [[H3581]] and might [[H1369]] are in Your hand, [[H3027]] and no [[H369]] one can stand [[H3320]] against You. [[H5973]] 
7 O our God, [[H430]] did You [[H859]] not [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] before [[H6440]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] and give it [[H5414]] forever [[H5769]] to the descendants [[H2233]] of Abraham [[H85]] Your friend? [[H157]] 
8 They have lived [[H3427]] in the land  and have built [[H1129]] in it  a sanctuary [[H4720]] for Your Name, [[H8034]] saying, [[H559]] 
9 ‘If [[H518]] disaster [[H7451]] comes [[H935]] upon us— [[H5921]] whether sword [[H2719]] or judgment, [[H8196]] plague [[H1698]] or famine— [[H7458]] we will stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] and before You, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] Your Name [[H8034]] is in this [[H2088]] temple. [[H1004]] We will cry out [[H2199]] to You [[H413]] in our distress, [[H6869]] and You will hear us [[H8085]] and deliver us. [[H3467]] 
10 And now, [[H6258]] here are [[H2009]] the men [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] Moab, [[H4124]] and Mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] whom [[H834]] You did not [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] invade [[H935]] when they came [[H935]] out of [[H776]] Egypt; [[H4714]] but [[H3588]] Israel turned away [[H5493]] from them [[H5921]] and did not [[H3808]] destroy them. [[H8045]] 
11 See [[H2009]] how they [[H1992]] are repaying [[H1580]] us [[H5921]] by coming [[H935]] to drive us out [[H1644]] of the possession [[H3425]] that [[H834]] You gave us as an inheritance. [[H3423]] 
12 O our God, [[H430]] will You not [[H3808]] judge [[H8199]] them?  For [[H3588]] we are powerless [[H369]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] vast [[H7227]] army [[H1995]] that comes [[H935]] against us. [[H5921]] We [[H587]] do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] to do, [[H6213]] but [[H3588]] our eyes [are] [[H5869]] upon You.” [[H5921]] 
13 Meanwhile all [the men] [[H3605]] of Judah, [[H3063]] with [[H1571]] their wives [[H802]] and children [[H1121]] and little ones, [[H2945]] were standing [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
14 Then the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] Jahaziel [[H3166]] son [[H1121]] of Zechariah, [[H2148]] the son [[H1121]] of Benaiah, [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeiel, [[H3273]] the son [[H1121]] of Mattaniah, [[H4983]] a Levite [[H3881]] from [[H4480]] Asaph’s [[H623]] descendants, [[H1121]] [as he stood] in the midst [[H8432]] of the assembly. [[H6951]] 
15 And he said, [[H559]] “Listen, [[H7181]] all [[H3605]] you people [[H3427]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem! [[H3389]] Listen, King [[H4428]] Jehoshaphat! [[H3092]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or discouraged [[H2865]] because of [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] vast [[H7227]] army, [[H1995]] for [[H3588]] the battle [[H4421]] does not belong [[H3808]] to you,  but [[H3588]] to God. [[H430]] 
16 Tomorrow [[H4279]] you are to march down [[H3381]] against them. [[H5921]] You will see [[H2005]] them coming up [[H5927]] the Ascent [[H4608]] of Ziz, [[H6732]] and you will find [[H4672]] them [[H853]] at the end [[H5490]] of the valley [[H5158]] facing [[H6440]] the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Jeruel. [[H3385]] 
17 You need not [[H3808]] fight [[H3898]] this [battle]. [[H2063]] Take up your positions, [[H3320]] stand firm, [[H5975]] and see [[H7200]] the salvation [[H3444]] of the LORD [[H3068]] on your behalf, [[H5973]] O Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or discouraged. [[H2865]] Go out [[H3318]] and face them [[H6440]] tomorrow, [[H4279]] for the LORD [[H3068]] is with you.’” [[H5973]] 
18 Then Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] bowed [[H6915]] with his face [[H639]] to the ground, [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H3427]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] fell down [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] to worship [[H7812]] Him. [[H3068]] 
19 And the Levites [[H3881]] from [[H4480]] the Kohathites [[H6956]] and Korahites [[H7145]] stood up [[H6965]] to praise [[H1984]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] shouting in a very loud [[H1419]] voice. [[H6963]] 
20 Early in the morning [[H1242]] they got up [[H7925]] and left [[H3318]] for the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Tekoa. [[H8620]] As they set out, [[H3318]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] stood up [[H5975]] and said, [[H559]] “Hear me, [[H8085]] O people [[H3427]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Believe [[H539]] in the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and you will be upheld; [[H539]] believe [[H539]] in His prophets, [[H5030]] and you will succeed. [[H6743]] 
21 Then [Jehoshaphat] consulted [[H3289]] with [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] and appointed those [[H5975]] who would sing [[H7891]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and praise [[H1984]] the splendor [[H1927]] of His holiness. [[H6944]] As they went out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] the army, [[H2502]] they were singing: [[H559]] “Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever.” [[H5769]] 
22 The moment [[H6256]] they began [[H2490]] their shouts [[H7440]] and praises, [[H8416]] the LORD [[H3068]] set [[H5414]] an ambush [[H693]] against the men [[H5921]] of Ammon, [[H1121]] Moab, [[H4124]] and Mount [[H2022]] Seir [[H8165]] who had come [[H935]] against Judah, [[H3063]] and they were defeated. [[H5062]] 
23 The Ammonites [[H1121]] and Moabites [[H4124]] rose up [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] destroying [[H2763]] [them] completely. [[H8045]] And when they had made an end [[H3615]] to the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Seir, [[H8165]] they helped [[H5826]] to destroy [[H4889]] one [[H376]] another. [[H7453]] 
24 When the men of Judah [[H3063]] came [[H935]] to [[H5921]] a place overlooking [[H4707]] the wilderness, [[H4057]] they looked [[H6437]] for [[H413]] the vast army, [[H1995]] but there [[H2005]] were only corpses [[H6297]] lying [[H5307]] on the ground; [[H776]] no one [[H369]] had escaped. [[H6413]] 
25 Then Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] and his people [[H5971]] went [[H935]] to carry off [[H962]] the plunder, [[H7998]] and they found [[H4672]] on the bodies [[H6297]] an abundance [[H7230]] of goods [[H7399]] and valuables— [[H2530]] more than [[H369]] they could carry away. [[H4853]] They were [[H1961]] gathering [[H962]] the plunder [[H7998]] for three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] there was so much. [[H7227]] 
26 On the fourth [[H7243]] day [[H3117]] they assembled [[H6950]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Beracah, [[H1294]] where [[H8033]] they blessed [[H1288]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Therefore [[H5921]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] is called [[H7121]] the Valley [[H6010]] of Beracah [[H1294]] to [[H5704]] this day. [[H3117]] 
27 Then all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] with Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] at their head, [[H7218]] returned [[H7725]] joyfully [[H8057]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] had made them rejoice [[H8055]] over their enemies. [[H341]] 
28 So they entered [[H935]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and went into [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] with harps, [[H5035]] lyres, [[H3658]] and trumpets. [[H2689]] 
29 And the fear [[H6343]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the lands [[H776]] when they heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had fought [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] the enemies [[H341]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
30 Then Jehoshaphat’s [[H3092]] kingdom [[H4438]] was at peace, [[H8252]] for his God [[H430]] had given him rest [[H5117]] on every side. [[H5439]] 
31 So Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]] He [was] thirty-five [[H7970]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] twenty-five [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Azubah [[H5806]] daughter [[H1323]] of Shilhi. [[H7977]] 
32 And [Jehoshaphat] walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of his father [[H1]] Asa [[H609]] and did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from it; [[H4480]] he did [[H6213]] what was right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
33 The high places, [[H1116]] however, [[H389]] were not [[H3808]] removed; [[H5493]] the people [[H5971]] had not [[H3808]] yet [[H5750]] set [[H3559]] their hearts [[H3824]] on the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
34 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] from beginning [[H7223]] to end, [[H314]] they are indeed [[H2005]] written [[H3789]] in the Chronicles [[H1697]] of Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Hanani, [[H2607]] which [[H834]] are recorded [[H5927]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
35 Later, [[H310]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] made an alliance [[H2266]] with [[H5973]] Ahaziah [[H274]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H1931]] acted [[H6213]] wickedly. [[H7561]] 
36 They agreed [[H2266]] to make [[H6213]] ships [[H591]] to go [[H1980]] to Tarshish, [[H8659]] and these were built [[H6213]] in Ezion-geber. [[H6100]] 
37 Then Eliezer [[H461]] son [[H1121]] of Dodavahu [[H1735]] of Mareshah [[H4762]] prophesied [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] saying, [[H559]] “Because you have allied yourself [[H2266]] with [[H5973]] Ahaziah, [[H274]] the LORD [[H3068]] has destroyed [[H6555]] your works.” [[H4639]] So the ships [[H591]] were wrecked [[H7665]] and were unable [[H3808]] to sail [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Tarshish. [[H8659]]
