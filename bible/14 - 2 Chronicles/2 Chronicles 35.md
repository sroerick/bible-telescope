1 Then Josiah [[H2977]] celebrated [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the Passover lamb [[H6453]] was slaughtered [[H7819]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] day of the first [[H7223]] month. [[H2320]] 
2 He appointed [[H5975]] the priests [[H3548]] to [[H5921]] their duties [[H4931]] and encouraged them [[H2388]] in the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 To the Levites [[H3881]] who taught [[H995]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and were holy [[H6918]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] [Josiah] said: [[H559]] “Put [[H5414]] the holy [[H6944]] ark [[H727]] in the temple [[H1004]] built [[H1129]] by Solomon [[H8010]] son [[H1121]] of David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] It is not to be [[H369]] carried around [[H4853]] on your shoulders. [[H3802]] Now [[H6258]] serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and His people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
4 Prepare [[H3559]] [yourselves] by your families [[H1]] in your divisions, [[H4256]] according to the instructions written [[H3791]] by David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and [[H4385]] his son [[H1121]] Solomon. [[H8010]] 
5 Moreover, stand [[H5975]] in the Holy Place [[H6944]] by the divisions [[H6391]] of the families [[H1]] of your fellow countrymen, [[H251]] the lay people, [[H1121]] and [according to] the divisions [[H2515]] of the houses [[H1004]] of the Levites. [[H3881]] 
6 Slaughter [[H7819]] the Passover lambs, [[H6453]] consecrate yourselves, [[H6942]] and make preparations [[H3559]] for your fellow countrymen [[H251]] to carry out [[H6213]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [given] by [[H3027]] Moses.” [[H4872]] 
7 From his [[H4428]] own [[H7399]] flocks [and herds], [[H6629]] Josiah [[H2977]] contributed [[H7311]] 30,000 {} [[H7970]] lambs [[H3532]] and goats [[H5795]] plus 3,000 [[H7969]] bulls [[H1241]] for the Passover offerings [[H6453]] for all [[H3605]] the people [[H1121]] who were present. [[H4672]] 
8 His officials [[H8269]] also contributed [[H7311]] willingly [[H5071]] to the people [[H5971]] and priests [[H3548]] and Levites. [[H3881]] Hilkiah, [[H2518]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] and Jehiel, [[H3171]] the administrators [[H5057]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] the priests [[H3548]] 2,600 [[H505]] Passover [offerings] [[H6453]] and 300 [[H7969]] bulls. [[H1241]] 
9 Additionally, Conaniah [[H3562]] and his brothers [[H251]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] and Nethanel, [[H5417]] as well as Hashabiah, [[H2811]] Jeiel, [[H3273]] and Jozabad, [[H3107]] officers [[H8269]] of the Levites, [[H3881]] donated [[H7311]] to the Levites [[H3881]] 5,000 {} [[H2568]] Passover offerings [[H6453]] and 500 [[H2568]] bulls. [[H1241]] 
10 So the service [[H5656]] was prepared; [[H3559]] the priests [[H3548]] stood [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] their places [[H5975]] and the Levites [[H3881]] in [[H5921]] their divisions [[H4256]] according to the king's [[H4428]] command. [[H4687]] 
11 And they slaughtered [[H7819]] the Passover lambs, [[H6453]] while the priests [[H3548]] sprinkled the blood handed to them [[H2236]] and the Levites [[H3881]] skinned [the animals]. [[H6584]] 
12 They set aside [[H5493]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] to be given [[H5414]] to the divisions [[H4653]] of the families [[H1]] of the lay people [[H1121]] to offer [[H7126]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] as is written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of Moses; [[H4872]] and they did the same [[H3651]] with the bulls. [[H1241]] 
13 They roasted [[H1310]] the Passover [animals] [[H6453]] on the fire [[H784]] according to regulation, [[H4941]] and they boiled [[H1310]] the [other] holy [offerings] [[H6944]] in pots, [[H5518]] kettles, [[H1731]] and bowls [[H6745]] and quickly brought [[H7323]] them to the lay people. [[H1121]] 
14 Afterward, [[H310]] they made preparations [[H3559]] for themselves [[H1992]] and for the priests, [[H3548]] since [[H3588]] the priests, [[H3548]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] [were] offering up [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and fat [[H2459]] until [[H5704]] nightfall. [[H3915]] So the Levites [[H3881]] made preparations [[H3559]] for themselves [[H1992]] and for the priests, [[H3548]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron. [[H175]] 
15 The singers, [[H7891]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Asaph, [[H623]] were at [[H5921]] their stations [[H4612]] according to the command [[H4687]] of David, [[H1732]] Asaph, [[H623]] Heman, [[H1968]] and Jeduthun [[H3038]] the king’s [[H4428]] seer. [[H2374]] And the gatekeepers [[H7778]] at each gate [[H8179]] did not [[H369]] need to leave [[H5493]] their position, [[H5656]] because [[H3588]] their fellow [[H251]] Levites [[H3881]] made preparations [[H3559]] for them.  
16 So on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the entire [[H3605]] service [[H5656]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was carried out [[H3559]] for celebrating [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] and offering [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] according to the command [[H4687]] of King [[H4428]] Josiah. [[H2977]] 
17 The Israelites [[H1121]] who were present [[H4672]] also observed [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] as well as the Feast [[H2282]] of Unleavened Bread [[H4682]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
18 No [[H3808]] such [[H3644]] Passover [[H6453]] had been observed [[H6213]] in Israel [[H3478]] since the days [[H3117]] of Samuel [[H8050]] the prophet. [[H5030]] None [[H3605]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] ever observed [[H6213]] a Passover [[H6453]] like the one that [[H834]] Josiah [[H2977]] observed [[H6213]] with the priests, [[H3548]] the Levites, [[H3881]] all [[H3605]] Judah, [[H3063]] the Israelites [[H3478]] who were present, [[H4672]] and the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
19 In the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] this [[H2088]] Passover [[H6453]] was observed. [[H6213]] 
20 After [[H310]] all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] when [[H834]] Josiah [[H2977]] had set [[H3559]] the temple {in order}, [[H1004]] Neco [[H5224]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] marched up [[H5927]] to fight [[H3898]] at Carchemish [[H3751]] by [[H5921]] the Euphrates, [[H6578]] and Josiah [[H2977]] went out [[H3318]] to confront him. [[H7125]] 
21 But Neco sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to him, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] “What is the issue between you and me, [[H4100]] O king [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] I have not [[H3808]] come against [[H5921]] you [[H859]] today, [[H3117]] but [[H3588]] I am fighting [[H4421]] another dynasty. [[H1004]] God [[H430]] told [[H559]] me to hurry; [[H926]] so stop [[H2308]] opposing God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] is with me, [[H5973]] or [[H408]] He will destroy you! [[H7843]] 
22 Josiah, however, [[H2977]] did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5437]] from him; [[H4480]] instead, [[H3588]] in order to engage him in battle, [[H3898]] he disguised himself. [[H2664]] He did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Neco’s [[H5224]] words [[H1697]] from the mouth [[H6310]] of God, [[H430]] but went [[H935]] to fight him [[H3898]] on the Plain [[H1237]] of Megiddo. [[H4023]] 
23 There the archers [[H3384]] shot [[H3384]] King [[H4428]] Josiah, [[H2977]] who [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to his servants, [[H5650]] “Take me away, [[H5674]] for [[H3588]] I am severely [[H3966]] wounded!” [[H2470]] 
24 So his servants [[H5650]] took him [[H5674]] out [[H4480]] of his chariot, [[H4818]] put him [[H7392]] in [[H5921]] his second [[H4932]] chariot, [[H7393]] and brought him [[H1980]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] where he died. [[H4191]] And [Josiah] was buried [[H6912]] in the tomb [[H6913]] of his fathers, [[H1]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] mourned [[H56]] for [[H5921]] [him]. [[H2977]] 
25 Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] lamented [[H6969]] over [[H5921]] Josiah, [[H2977]] and to [[H5704]] this day [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] the choirs of men [[H7891]] and women [[H7891]] sing [[H559]] laments [[H7015]] over [[H5921]] Josiah. [[H2977]] They established [[H5414]] them as a statute [[H2706]] for [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and indeed [[H2005]] they are written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book of Laments. [[H7015]] 
26 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] along with his deeds of loving devotion [[H2617]] according to what is written [[H3789]] in the Law [[H8451]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] 
27 and his words, [[H1697]] from beginning [[H7223]] to end, [[H314]] they are indeed [[H2005]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah. [[H3063]]
