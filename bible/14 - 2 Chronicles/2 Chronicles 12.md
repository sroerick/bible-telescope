[[2 Chronicles 11|←]] • [[2 Chronicles 13|→]]
1 After Rehoboam had established [[H3559]] his [[H7346]] sovereignty [[H4438]] and royal power, [[H2393]] he and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with him [[H5973]] forsook [[H5800]] the law [[H8451]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 In the fifth [[H2549]] year [[H8141]] of Rehoboam's [[H7346]] reign, [[H4428]] because [[H3588]] they had been unfaithful [[H4603]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] Shishak [[H7895]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] came up [[H5927]] and attacked [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] 
3 with 1,200 [[H505]] chariots, [[H7393]] 60,000 {} [[H8346]] horsemen, [[H6571]] and countless [[H369]] troops [[H5971]] who [[H834]] came [[H935]] with him [[H5973]] out of Egypt— [[H4714]] Libyans, [[H3864]] Sukkites, [[H5525]] and Cushites. [[H3569]] 
4 He captured [[H3920]] the fortified [[H4694]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and came [[H935]] as far as [[H5704]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
5 Then Shemaiah [[H8098]] the prophet [[H5030]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] and the leaders [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] who [[H834]] had gathered [[H622]] at [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] because of [[H6440]] Shishak, [[H7895]] and he said to [[H559]] them,  “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘You [[H859]] have forsaken Me; [[H5800]] therefore, [[H637]] I [[H589]] have forsaken [[H5800]] you [[H853]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Shishak. [[H7895]] 
6 So the leaders [[H8269]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the king [[H4428]] humbled themselves [[H3665]] and said, [[H559]] “The LORD [is] [[H3068]] righteous.” [[H6662]] 
7 When the LORD [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they had humbled themselves, [[H3665]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] saying, [[H559]] “They have humbled themselves; [[H3665]] I will not [[H3808]] destroy them, [[H7843]] but will soon grant [[H5414]] them [[H1992]] deliverance. [[H6413]] My wrath [[H2534]] will not [[H3808]] be poured out [[H5413]] on Jerusalem [[H3389]] through [[H3027]] Shishak. [[H7895]] 
8 Nevertheless, [[H3588]] they will become [[H1961]] his servants, [[H5650]] so that they may learn [[H3045]] the difference between serving [[H5656]] Me and serving [[H5656]] the kings [[H4467]] of other lands.” [[H776]] 
9 So King [[H4428]] Shishak [[H7895]] of Egypt [[H4714]] attacked [[H5927]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and seized [[H3947]] the treasures [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H853]] of the royal [[H4428]] palace. [[H1004]] He took [[H3947]] everything, [[H3605]] [including] [[H3947]] the gold [[H2091]] shields [[H4043]] that [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made. [[H6213]] 
10 Then King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] made [[H6213]] bronze [[H5178]] shields [[H4043]] in their place [[H8478]] and committed [[H6485]] them to [[H5921]] the care [[H3027]] of the captains [[H8269]] of the guard [[H7323]] on duty [[H8104]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the royal [[H4428]] palace. [[H1004]] 
11 Whenever [[H1767]] the king [[H4428]] would enter [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the guards [[H7323]] would go [with him], [[H935]] bearing [the shields], [[H5375]] and [later] take them back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the guardroom. [[H7323]] 
12 Because Rehoboam humbled himself, [[H3665]] the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] turned away [[H7725]] from him, [[H4480]] and He did not [[H3808]] destroy him completely. [[H7843]] Moreover, [[H1571]] conditions [[H1697]] were [[H1961]] good [[H2896]] in Judah. [[H3063]] 
13 Thus King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] established himself [[H2388]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] [He was] [[H7346]] forty-one [[H705]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] seventeen [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the city [[H5892]] the LORD [[H3068]] had chosen [[H977]] from all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] in which to put [[H7760]] His Name. [[H8034]] His mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Naamah [[H5279]] the Ammonite. [[H5985]] 
14 And Rehoboam did evil [[H6213]] because [[H3588]] he did not [[H3808]] set [[H3559]] his heart [[H3820]] to seek [[H1875]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 Now the acts [[H1697]] of Rehoboam [[H7346]] from first [[H7223]] to last, [[H314]] [are] they [[H3808]] not [[H1992]] written [[H3789]] in the records [[H1697]] of Shemaiah [[H8098]] the Prophet [[H5030]] and of Iddo [[H5714]] the Seer [[H2374]] concerning the genealogies? [[H3187]] There was war [[H4421]] between Rehoboam [[H7346]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] throughout [[H3605]] their days. [[H3117]] 
16 And Rehoboam [[H7346]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And his son [[H1121]] Abijah [[H29]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
