1 Now Solomon [[H8010]] purposed [[H559]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and a royal [[H4438]] palace for himself. [[H1004]] 
2 So he conscripted [[H5608]] 70,000 {} [[H7657]] porters, [[H5449]] 80,000 {} [[H8084]] stonecutters [[H2672]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] and 3,600 [[H7969]] supervisors. [[H5329]] 
3 Then Solomon [[H8010]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Hiram [[H2361]] of Tyre: [[H6865]] “Do for me as [[H834]] you did [[H6213]] for [[H5973]] my father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] when you sent [[H7971]] him  cedars [[H730]] to build [[H1129]] himself  a house [[H1004]] to live in. [[H3427]] 
4 Behold, [[H2009]] I am about to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3069]] my God [[H430]] to dedicate [[H6942]] to Him  for burning [[H6999]] fragrant [[H5561]] incense [[H7004]] before Him, [[H6440]] for displaying the showbread [[H4635]] continuously, [[H8548]] and for making burnt offerings [[H5930]] every morning [[H1242]] and evening [[H6153]] as well as on the Sabbaths, [[H7676]] New Moons, [[H2320]] and appointed feasts [[H4150]] of the LORD [[H3069]] our God. [[H430]] This [[H2063]] is ordained for [[H5921]] Israel forever. [[H3478]] 
5 The house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] am building [[H1129]] will be great, [[H1419]] for [[H3588]] our God [[H430]] is greater [[H1419]] than all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]] 
6 But who [[H4310]] is able [[H6113]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for Him,  since [[H3588]] the heavens, [[H8064]] even the highest heavens, [[H8064]] cannot [[H3808]] contain Him? [[H3557]] Who then [[H4310]] am I, [[H589]] that [[H834]] I should build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for Him,  except [as a place] [[H3588]] to burn sacrifices [[H6999]] before Him? [[H6440]] 
7 Send [[H7971]] me,  therefore, [[H6258]] a craftsman [[H376]] who is skilled [[H3045]] in engraving [[H6605]] to work [[H6213]] with gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] bronze [[H5178]] and iron, [[H1270]] purple, [[H710]] crimson, [[H3758]] and blue yarn. [[H8504]] He will work with [[H5973]] my craftsmen [[H2450]] in Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] whom [[H834]] my father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] provided. [[H3559]] 
8 Send me also [[H7971]] cedar, [[H730]] cypress, [[H1265]] and algum [[H418]] logs [[H6086]] from Lebanon, [[H3844]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] that [[H834]] your servants [[H5650]] have skill [[H3045]] to cut [[H3772]] timber [[H6086]] [there]. [[H3844]] And indeed, [[H2009]] my servants [[H5650]] will work with [[H5973]] yours [[H5650]] 
9 to prepare [[H3559]] for me  timber [[H6086]] in abundance, [[H7230]] because [[H3588]] the temple [[H1004]] I [[H589]] am building [[H1129]] will be great [[H1419]] and wonderful. [[H6381]] 
10 I will pay [[H5414]] your servants, [[H5650]] the woodcutters, [[H2404]] 20,000 {} [[H6242]] cors [[H3734]] of ground [[H4347]] wheat, [[H2406]] 20,000 {} [[H6242]] cors [[H3734]] of barley, [[H8184]] 20,000 {} [[H6242]] baths [[H1324]] of wine, [[H3196]] and 20,000 {} [[H6242]] baths [[H1324]] of olive oil.” [[H8081]] 
11 Then King [[H4428]] Hiram [[H2361]] of Tyre [[H6865]] wrote a letter [[H3791]] in reply [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Solomon: [[H8010]] “Because the LORD [[H3068]] loves [[H160]] His people, [[H5971]] He has set you [[H5414]] over them [[H5921]] as king.” [[H4428]] 
12 Hiram [[H2361]] also said: [[H559]] “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H834]] made [[H6213]] the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth! [[H776]] He [[H834]] has given [[H5414]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] a wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] with insight [[H7922]] and understanding, [[H998]] who [[H834]] will build [[H1129]] a temple [[H1004]] for the LORD [[H3068]] and a royal [[H4438]] palace for himself. [[H1004]] 
13 So now I [[H6258]] am sending you [[H7971]] Huram-abi, [[H2361]] a skillful [[H2450]] man [[H376]] endowed [[H3045]] with understanding. [[H998]] 
14 He is the son [[H1121]] of a woman [[H802]] from [[H4480]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Dan, [[H1835]] and his father [[H1]] is a man [[H376]] of Tyre. [[H6876]] He is skilled [[H3045]] in work [[H6213]] with gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] bronze [[H5178]] and iron, [[H1270]] stone [[H68]] and wood, [[H6086]] purple, [[H713]] blue, [[H8504]] and crimson yarn, [[H3758]] and fine linen. [[H948]] He is experienced in every kind [[H3605]] of engraving [[H6605]] and can execute [[H2803]] any [[H3605]] design [[H4284]] that [[H834]] is given [[H5414]] him.  He will work with [[H5973]] your craftsmen [[H2450]] and with those [[H2450]] of my lord, [[H113]] your father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] 
15 Now [[H6258]] let my lord [[H113]] send [[H7971]] to his servants [[H5650]] the wheat, [[H2406]] barley, [[H8184]] olive oil, [[H8081]] and wine [[H3196]] he promised. [[H559]] 
16 We [[H587]] will cut [[H3772]] logs [[H6086]] from [[H4480]] Lebanon, [[H3844]] as many [[H3605]] as you need, [[H6878]] and in rafts [[H7513]] by [[H5921]] sea [[H3220]] we will bring them [[H935]] to you  at Joppa. [[H3305]] Then you [[H859]] can take them up [[H5927]] to Jerusalem.” [[H3389]] 
17 Solomon [[H8010]] numbered [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] the foreign [[H1616]] men [[H376]] in the land [[H776]] of Israel, [[H3478]] following [[H310]] the census [[H5610]] his father [[H1]] David [had conducted], [[H1732]] and there were found to be [[H4672]] 153,600 [in all]. [[H3967]] 
18 Solomon made [[H6213]] 70,000 of them [[H7657]] porters, [[H5449]] 80,000 {} [[H8084]] stonecutters [[H2672]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] and 3,600 [[H7969]] supervisors. [[H5329]]
