1 Ahaz [[H271]] was twenty [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] sixteen [[H8337]] years. [[H8141]] And unlike David [[H1732]] his forefather, [[H1]] he did not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 Instead, he walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and even [[H1571]] made [[H6213]] cast images [[H4541]] of the Baals. [[H1168]] 
3 Moreover, Ahaz [[H1931]] burned incense [[H6999]] in the Valley of Hinnom [[H1516]] and sacrificed [[H1197]] his sons [[H1121]] in the fire, [[H784]] according to the abominations [[H8441]] of the nations [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3423]] had driven out [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
4 And he sacrificed [[H2076]] and burned incense [[H6999]] on the high places, [[H1116]] on [[H5921]] the hills, [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree. [[H6086]] 
5 So the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] delivered Ahaz [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Aram, [[H758]] who attacked [[H5221]] him and took [[H7617]] many [[H1419]] captives [[H7633]] to Damascus. [[H1834]] Ahaz was also [[H1571]] delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who struck [[H5221]] him with great [[H1419]] force. [[H4347]] 
6 For in one [[H259]] day [[H3117]] Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah [[H7425]] killed [[H2026]] 120,000 [[H3967]] valiant [[H2428]] men [[H1121]] in Judah. [[H3063]] [This happened] because they had forsaken [[H5800]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
7 Zichri, [[H2147]] an Ephraimite [[H669]] warrior, [[H1368]] killed [[H2026]] Maaseiah [[H4641]] the son [[H1121]] of the king, [[H4428]] Azrikam [[H5840]] the governor [[H5057]] of the palace, [[H1004]] and Elkanah [[H511]] the second [[H4932]] to the king. [[H4428]] 
8 Then the Israelites [[H1121]] took 200,000 [[H3967]] captives [[H7617]] from their kinsmen— [[H251]] women, [[H802]] sons, [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] They also [[H1571]] carried off [[H962]] a great deal of [[H7227]] plunder [[H7998]] and brought [[H935]] it [[H7998]] to Samaria. [[H8111]] 
9 But a prophet [[H5030]] of the LORD [[H3068]] named [[H8034]] Oded [[H5752]] was [[H1961]] there, [[H8033]] and he went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H6440]] the army [[H6635]] that returned [[H935]] to Samaria. [[H8111]] “Look,” [[H2009]] he said [[H559]] to them,  “because of His wrath [[H2534]] against [[H5921]] Judah, [[H3063]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] has delivered them [[H5414]] into your hands. [[H3027]] But you have slaughtered [[H2026]] them  in a rage [[H2197]] [that] reaches up [[H5060]] to heaven. [[H8064]] 
10 And now [[H6258]] you [[H859]] intend [[H559]] to reduce to slavery [[H3533]] the men [[H5650]] and women [[H8198]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]] But are you [[H859]] not [[H3808]] also [[H7535]] guilty [[H819]] before the LORD [[H3068]] your God? [[H430]] 
11 Now therefore, [[H6258]] listen to me [[H8085]] and return [[H7725]] the captives [[H7633]] you took [[H7617]] from your kinsmen, [[H251]] for [[H3588]] the fierce anger [[H2740]] of the LORD [[H3069]] is upon you.” [[H5921]] 
12 Then some [[H376]] of the leaders [[H7218]] of the Ephraimites— [[H1121]] Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Jehohanan, [[H3076]] Berechiah [[H1296]] son [[H1121]] of Meshillemoth, [[H4919]] Jehizkiah [[H3169]] son [[H1121]] of Shallum, [[H7967]] and Amasa [[H6021]] son [[H1121]] of Hadlai— [[H2311]] stood [[H6965]] in opposition to [[H5921]] those arriving [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the war. [[H6635]] 
13 “You must not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] the captives [[H7633]] here,” [[H2008]] they said, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are proposing [[H559]] to bring guilt [[H819]] upon us [[H5921]] from the LORD [[H3068]] and to add [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] our sins [[H2403]] and our guilt. [[H819]] For [[H3588]] our  guilt [[H819]] is great, [[H7227]] and fierce anger [[H2740]] is upon [[H5921]] Israel.” [[H3478]] 
14 So the armed men [[H2502]] left [[H5800]] the captives [[H7633]] and the plunder [[H961]] before [[H6440]] the leaders [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the assembly. [[H6951]] 
15 Then the men [[H376]] who [[H834]] were designated [[H5344]] by name [[H8034]] arose, [[H6965]] took charge [[H2388]] of the captives, [[H7633]] and provided from [[H4480]] the plunder [[H7998]] clothing [[H3847]] for the naked. [[H4636]] They clothed them, [[H3847]] gave them sandals [[H5274]] and food [[H398]] and drink, [[H8248]] anointed [their wounds], [[H5480]] and put [[H5095]] all [[H3605]] the feeble [[H3782]] on donkeys. [[H2543]] So they brought them [[H935]] to Jericho, [[H3405]] the City [[H5892]] of Palms, [[H8558]] to [[H681]] their brothers. [[H251]] Then they returned [[H7725]] to Samaria. [[H8111]] 
16 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] sent [[H7971]] for help [[H5826]] from [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] 
17 The Edomites [[H130]] had again [[H5750]] come [[H935]] and attacked [[H5221]] Judah [[H3063]] and carried away [[H7617]] captives. [[H7628]] 
18 The Philistines [[H6430]] had also raided [[H6584]] the cities [[H5892]] of the foothills [[H8219]] and the Negev [[H5045]] of Judah, [[H3063]] capturing [[H3920]] and occupying [[H3427]] Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] Aijalon, [[H357]] Gederoth, [[H1450]] as well as [[H853]] Soco, [[H7755]] Timnah, [[H8553]] and [[H853]] Gimzo [[H1579]] with their villages. [[H1323]] 
19 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] humbled [[H3665]] Judah [[H3063]] because [[H5668]] Ahaz [[H271]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] had thrown off restraint [[H6544]] in Judah [[H3063]] and had been most unfaithful [[H4603]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
20 Then Tiglath-pileser [[H8407]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] came [[H935]] to Ahaz [[H5921]] but afflicted [[H6696]] him  rather than [[H3808]] strengthening him. [[H2388]] 
21 Although [[H3588]] Ahaz [[H271]] had taken a portion [[H2505]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] from [[H853]] the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and from the princes [[H8269]] and had presented [[H5414]] [it] to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] it did not [[H3808]] help him. [[H5833]] 
22 In the time [[H6256]] of his distress, [[H6887]] King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] became even more [[H3254]] unfaithful [[H4603]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
23 He sacrificed [[H2076]] to the gods [[H430]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] which had defeated [[H5221]] him,  for he thought, [[H559]] “Since [[H3588]] the gods [[H430]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] have helped [[H5826]] them, [[H853]] I will sacrifice [[H2076]] to them  that they may help me.” [[H5826]] But these [[H1992]] were [[H1961]] the downfall [[H3782]] of [Ahaz]  and of all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
24 Then Ahaz [[H271]] gathered up [[H622]] the articles [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] cut them [[H3627]] into pieces, [[H7112]] shut [[H5462]] the doors [[H1817]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and set up [[H6213]] altars [[H4196]] of his own  on every [[H3605]] street corner [[H6438]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
25 In every [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] he built [[H6213]] high places [[H1116]] to offer incense [[H6999]] to other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and so he provoked [[H3707]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of his fathers. [[H1]] 
26 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [of Ahaz] [[H1697]] and all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] from beginning [[H7223]] to end, [[H314]] they are indeed [[H2005]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Israel. [[H3478]] 
27 And Ahaz [[H271]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the city [[H5892]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] but [[H3588]] he was not [[H3808]] placed [[H935]] in the tombs [[H6913]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] And his son [[H1121]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
