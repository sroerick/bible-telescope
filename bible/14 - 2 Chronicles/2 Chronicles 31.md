1 When all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] had ended, [[H3615]] the Israelites [[H3478]] in attendance [[H4672]] went out [[H3318]] to the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and broke up [[H7665]] the sacred pillars, [[H4676]] chopped down [[H1438]] the Asherah poles, [[H842]] and tore down [[H5422]] the high places [[H1116]] and altars [[H4196]] throughout [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] as well as in Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] until [[H5704]] they had utterly destroyed them all. [[H3615]] Then all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] returned [[H7725]] to their cities, [[H5892]] each [[H376]] to his own property. [[H272]] 
2 Hezekiah [[H2396]] reestablished [[H5975]] the divisions [[H4256]] of the priests [[H3548]] and Levites— [[H3881]] each [[H376]] corresponding to [[H6310]] their service [[H5656]] among the priests [[H3548]] and Levites— [[H3881]] for the burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings, [[H8002]] for ministry, [[H8334]] for giving thanks, [[H3034]] and for singing praises [[H1984]] at the gates [[H8179]] of the LORD's [[H3069]] dwelling. [[H4264]] 
3 The king [[H4428]] contributed [[H4521]] from [[H4480]] his own possessions [[H7399]] for the regular morning [[H1242]] and evening [[H6153]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and for the burnt offerings [[H5930]] on the Sabbaths, [[H7676]] New Moons, [[H2320]] and appointed feasts, [[H4150]] as written [[H3789]] in the Law [[H8451]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 Moreover, he commanded [[H559]] the people [[H5971]] living [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] to make [[H5414]] a contribution [[H4521]] for the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] so that [[H4616]] they could devote themselves [[H2388]] to the Law [[H8451]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 As soon as the order [[H1697]] went out, [[H6555]] the Israelites [[H1121]] generously provided [[H7235]] the firstfruits [[H7225]] of the grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] oil, [[H3323]] and honey, [[H1706]] and of all [[H3605]] the produce [[H8393]] of the field, [[H7704]] and they brought in [[H935]] an abundance, [[H7230]] a tithe [[H4643]] of everything. [[H3605]] 
6 And the Israelites [[H1121]] and Judahites [[H3063]] who lived [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] also [[H1571]] brought [[H935]] a tithe [[H4643]] of their herds [[H1241]] and flocks [[H6629]] and a tithe [[H4643]] of the holy things [[H6944]] consecrated [[H6942]] to the LORD [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and they laid them [[H5414]] in large heaps. [[H6194]] 
7 In the third [[H7992]] month [[H2320]] they began [[H2490]] building up [[H3245]] the heaps, [[H6194]] and they finished [[H3615]] in the seventh [[H7637]] month. [[H2320]] 
8 When Hezekiah [[H2396]] and his officials [[H8269]] came [[H935]] and viewed [[H7200]] the heaps, [[H6194]] they blessed [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] and His people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
9 Then Hezekiah [[H2396]] questioned [[H1875]] the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] about [[H5921]] the heaps, [[H6194]] 
10 and Azariah, [[H5838]] the chief [[H7218]] priest [[H3548]] of the household [[H1004]] of Zadok, [[H6659]] answered him, [[H559]] “Since [the people] began [[H2490]] to bring [[H935]] their contributions [[H8641]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] we have had enough [[H7646]] to eat [[H398]] and there is plenty [[H7230]] left over, [[H3498]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has blessed [[H1288]] His people; [[H5971]] this [[H2088]] great abundance [[H1995]] is what is left over. [[H3498]] 
11 Then Hezekiah [[H2396]] commanded [[H559]] them to prepare [[H3559]] storerooms [[H3957]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and they did so. [[H3559]] 
12 And they faithfully brought in [[H935]] the contributions, [[H8641]] tithes, [[H4643]] and dedicated gifts. [[H6944]] Conaniah [[H3562]] the Levite [[H3881]] was the officer [[H5057]] in charge of them, [[H5921]] and his brother [[H251]] Shimei [[H8096]] was second. [[H4932]] 
13 Jehiel, [[H3171]] Azaziah, [[H5812]] Nahath, [[H5184]] Asahel, [[H6214]] Jerimoth, [[H3406]] Jozabad, [[H3107]] Eliel, [[H447]] Ismachiah, [[H3253]] Mahath, [[H4287]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] [were] overseers [[H6496]] under the authority [[H3027]] of Conaniah [[H3562]] and his brother [[H251]] Shimei, [[H8096]] by appointment [[H4662]] of King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] and of Azariah [[H5838]] the chief official [[H5057]] of the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]] 
14 Kore [[H6981]] son [[H1121]] of Imnah [[H3232]] the Levite, [[H3881]] the keeper [[H7778]] of the East Gate, [[H4217]] was in charge [[H5921]] of the freewill offerings [[H5071]] given to God, [[H430]] distributing [[H5414]] the contributions [[H8641]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H6942]] the consecrated gifts. [[H6944]] 
15 Under [[H5921]] his authority [[H3027]] Eden, [[H5731]] Miniamin, [[H4509]] Jeshua, [[H3442]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] Amariah, [[H568]] and Shecaniah [[H7935]] in the cities [[H5892]] of the priests [[H3548]] faithfully [[H530]] distributed [[H5414]] to their [fellow priests] [[H251]] by divisions, [[H4256]] whether large [[H1419]] or small. [[H6996]] 
16 In addition, [[H905]] they distributed to the males [[H2145]] registered by genealogy [[H3187]] who were three [[H7969]] years of age [[H1121]] or older— [[H4605]] to all [[H3605]] who would enter [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] for their daily [[H3117]] duties [[H1697]] for service [[H5656]] in the responsibilities [[H4931]] of their divisions. [[H4256]] 
17 They also distributed [[H853]] to the priests [[H3548]] enrolled according to [[H1]] families [[H1004]] in the genealogy, [[H3188]] and to the Levites [[H3881]] twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older, [[H4605]] according their duties [[H4931]] [and] divisions. [[H4256]] 
18 The genealogy [[H3188]] included all [[H3605]] the little ones, [[H2945]] wives, [[H802]] sons, [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] in the whole [[H3605]] assembly. [[H6951]] For [[H3588]] they had faithfully [[H530]] consecrated themselves [[H6942]] as holy. [[H6944]] 
19 As for the priests, [[H3548]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] [who lived on] the farmlands [[H7704]] around their cities, [[H5892]] in each [[H3605]] and every city, [[H5892]] men [[H376]] were designated [[H5344]] by name [[H8034]] to distribute [[H5414]] a portion [[H4490]] to every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] among the priests [[H3548]] and to every [[H3605]] Levite [[H3881]] listed by the genealogies. [[H3187]] 
20 So this is what [[H2063]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] did [[H6213]] throughout [[H3605]] Judah. [[H3063]] He did [[H6213]] what was good [[H2896]] and upright [[H3477]] and true [[H571]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God. [[H430]] 
21 He was diligent [[H3605]] in every [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] that [[H834]] he began [[H2490]] in the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] and in the law [[H8451]] and the commandments, [[H4687]] in order to seek [[H1875]] his God. [[H430]] And so he prospered. [[H6743]]
