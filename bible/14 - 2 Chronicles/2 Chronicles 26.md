[[2 Chronicles 25|←]] • [[2 Chronicles 27|→]]
1 All [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] took [[H3947]] Uzziah, [[H5818]] who [[H1931]] [was] sixteen [[H8337]] years old, [[H1121]] and made him king [[H4427]] in place of [[H8478]] his father [[H1]] Amaziah. [[H558]] 
2 [Uzziah was the one] [[H1931]] who rebuilt [[H1129]] Eloth [[H359]] and restored [[H7725]] it to Judah [[H3063]] after [[H310]] King [Amaziah] [[H4428]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers. [[H1]] 
3 Uzziah [[H5818]] was sixteen [[H8337]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] fifty-two [[H2572]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Jecoliah; [[H3203]] [she was] from [[H4480]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
4 And he did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] his father [[H1]] Amaziah [[H558]] had done. [[H6213]] 
5 He sought [[H1875]] God [[H430]] throughout the days [[H3117]] of Zechariah, [[H2148]] who instructed him [[H995]] in the fear [[H7200]] of God. [[H430]] And as long as [[H3117]] he sought [[H1875]] the LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] gave him success. [[H6743]] 
6 Uzziah went out [[H3318]] to wage war [[H3898]] against the Philistines, [[H6430]] and he tore down [[H6555]] the walls [[H2346]] of Gath, [[H1661]] Jabneh, [[H2996]] and [[H853]] Ashdod. [[H795]] Then he built [[H1129]] cities [[H5892]] near Ashdod [[H795]] and among the Philistines. [[H6430]] 
7 God [[H430]] helped [[H5826]] him against [[H5921]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] against [[H5921]] the Arabs [[H6163]] living [[H3427]] in Gur-baal, [[H1485]] and against the Meunites. [[H4586]] 
8 The Ammonites [[H5984]] brought [[H5414]] tribute [[H4503]] to Uzziah, [[H5818]] and his fame [[H8034]] spread [[H1980]] as far [[H5704]] as the border [[H935]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] he had become [[H5704]] exceedingly [[H4605]] powerful. [[H2388]] 
9 Uzziah [[H5818]] built [[H1129]] towers [[H4026]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] at [[H5921]] the Corner [[H6438]] Gate, [[H8179]] the Valley [[H1516]] Gate, [[H8179]] and the angle in the wall, [[H4740]] and he fortified them. [[H2388]] 
10 Since [[H3588]] he had [[H1961]] much [[H7227]] livestock [[H4735]] in the foothills [[H8219]] and in the plain, [[H4334]] he built [[H1129]] towers [[H4026]] in the desert [[H4057]] and dug [[H2672]] many [[H7227]] cisterns. [[H953]] And since [[H3588]] he was [[H1961]] a lover [[H157]] of the soil, [[H127]] he had farmers [[H406]] and vinedressers [[H3755]] in the hill country [[H2022]] and in the fertile fields. [[H3760]] 
11 Uzziah [[H5818]] had [[H1961]] an army [[H2428]] ready [[H6213]] for battle [[H4421]] that went out [[H3318]] to war [[H6635]] by assigned divisions, [[H1416]] as recorded [[H4557]] by [[H3027]] Jeiel [[H3273]] the scribe [[H5608]] and Maaseiah [[H4641]] the officer [[H7860]] under [[H5921]] the direction [[H3027]] of Hananiah, [[H2608]] one of the royal [[H4428]] officers. [[H8269]] 
12 The total [[H3605]] number [[H4557]] of heads [[H7218]] of families [[H1]] was 2,600 [[H505]] mighty warriors. [[H1368]] 
13 Under [[H5921]] their authority [[H3027]] was an army [[H2428]] of 307,500 [[H7969]] equipped [[H6213]] for combat, [[H4421]] a powerful force [[H3581]] to support [[H5826]] the king [[H4428]] against [[H5921]] his enemies. [[H341]] 
14 Uzziah [[H5818]] supplied [[H3559]] the entire [[H3605]] army [[H6635]] with shields, [[H4043]] spears, [[H7420]] helmets, [[H3553]] armor, [[H8302]] bows, [[H7198]] and slingstones. [[H68]] 
15 And in Jerusalem [[H3389]] he made [[H6213]] skillfully [[H2803]] designed [[H4284]] devices [[H2810]] to shoot [[H3384]] arrows [[H2678]] and catapult large [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] [from] [[H1961]] the towers [[H4026]] and [[H5921]] corners. [[H6438]] So his fame [[H8034]] spread [[H3318]] far [and wide], [[H7350]] for [[H3588]] he was marvelously [[H6381]] helped [[H5826]] until [[H5704]] he became powerful. [[H2388]] 
16 But when [Uzziah] grew powerful, [[H2393]] his arrogance [[H1361]] led to his own destruction. [[H7843]] He was unfaithful [[H4603]] to the LORD [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] for he entered [[H935]] the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to burn incense [[H6999]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of incense. [[H7004]] 
17 Then Azariah [[H5838]] the priest, [[H3548]] along with [[H5973]] eighty [[H8084]] brave [[H2428]] priests [[H3548]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] went in [[H935]] after him. [[H310]] 
18 They took their stand [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] King [[H4428]] Uzziah [[H5818]] and said, [[H559]] “Uzziah, [[H5818]] you have no [[H3808]] right to offer incense [[H6999]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Only [[H3588]] the priests, [[H3548]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] are consecrated [[H6942]] to burn incense. [[H6999]] Leave [[H3318]] the sanctuary, [[H4720]] for [[H3588]] you have acted unfaithfully; [[H4603]] you will not [[H3808]] receive honor [[H3519]] from [[H4480]] the LORD [[H3068]] God. [[H430]] 
19 Uzziah, [[H5818]] with a censer [[H4730]] in his hand [[H3027]] to offer incense, [[H6999]] was enraged. [[H2196]] But while he raged [[H2196]] against [[H5973]] the priests [[H3548]] in their presence [[H6440]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] before [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of incense, [[H7004]] leprosy [[H6883]] broke out [[H2224]] on his forehead. [[H4696]] 
20 When Azariah [[H5838]] the chief [[H7218]] priest [[H3548]] and all [[H3605]] the priests [[H3548]] turned [[H6437]] to him [[H413]] and saw [[H2009]] his [[H1931]] leprous [[H6879]] forehead, [[H4696]] they rushed him [[H926]] out. [[H8033]] Indeed, [[H1571]] he himself [[H1931]] hurried [[H1765]] to get out, [[H3318]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had afflicted him. [[H5060]] 
21 So King [[H4428]] Uzziah [[H5818]] was [[H1961]] a leper [[H6879]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of his death. [[H4194]] He lived [[H3427]] in isolation, [[H2669]] leprous [[H6879]] and [[H3588]] cut off [[H1504]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] while his son [[H1121]] Jotham [[H3147]] had charge [[H5921]] of the royal [[H4428]] palace [[H1004]] to govern [[H8199]] the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]] 
22 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Uzziah, [[H5818]] from beginning [[H7223]] to end, [[H314]] they are recorded [[H3789]] by the prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz. [[H531]] 
23 And Uzziah [[H5818]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] near [[H5973]] [them] [[H1]] in the field [[H7704]] of burial [[H6900]] which [belonged] [[H834]] to the kings; [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] [the people] said, [[H559]] “He [was] [[H1931]] a leper.” [[H6879]] And his son [[H1121]] Jotham [[H3147]] became king [[H4427]] in his place.
