1 Then the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] made Ahaziah, [[H274]] the youngest [[H6996]] son [of Jehoram], [[H1121]] king [[H4427]] in his place, [[H8478]] since [[H3588]] the raiders [[H1416]] who had come [[H935]] into the camp [[H4264]] with the Arabs [[H6163]] had killed [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the older sons. [[H7223]] So Ahaziah [[H274]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] became king [[H4427]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
2 Ahaziah [[H274]] [was] twenty-two [[H705]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] one [[H259]] year. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Athaliah, [[H6271]] the granddaughter [[H1323]] of Omri. [[H6018]] 
3 Ahaziah [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] walked [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab, [[H256]] for [[H3588]] his mother [[H517]] was his counselor [[H3289]] in wickedness. [[H7561]] 
4 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [had done], [[H256]] for [[H3588]] to his  destruction [[H4889]] they [[H1992]] were [[H1961]] his  counselors [[H3289]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of his father. [[H1]] 
5 [Ahaziah] also [[H1571]] followed [[H1980]] their counsel [[H6098]] and went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] Joram [[H3088]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] to fight [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] at Ramoth-gilead. [[H7433]] But the Arameans [[H7421]] wounded [[H5221]] Joram; [[H3141]] 
6 so he returned [[H7725]] to Jezreel [[H3157]] to recover [[H7495]] from [[H3588]] the wounds [[H4347]] they had inflicted on him [[H5221]] at Ramah [[H7414]] when he fought [[H3898]] against [[H854]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram. [[H758]] Then Ahaziah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went down [[H3381]] to Jezreel [[H3157]] to visit [[H7200]] Joram [[H3088]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab, [[H256]] since [[H3588]] Joram [[H1931]] had been wounded. [[H2470]] 
7 Ahaziah’s [[H274]] downfall [[H8395]] came [[H1961]] from God [[H430]] when he went [[H935]] to visit [[H413]] Joram. [[H3141]] When Ahaziah arrived, [[H935]] he went out [[H3318]] with [[H5973]] Joram [[H3088]] to [[H413]] meet Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Nimshi, [[H5250]] whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had anointed [[H4886]] to destroy [[H3772]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab. [[H256]] 
8 So while Jehu [[H3058]] was executing judgment [[H8199]] on [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab, [[H256]] he found [[H4672]] the rulers [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the sons [[H1121]] of Ahaziah’s [[H274]] brothers [[H251]] who were serving [[H8334]] Ahaziah, [[H274]] and he killed them. [[H2026]] 
9 Then Jehu looked for [[H1245]] Ahaziah, [[H274]] and Jehu’s soldiers captured [[H3920]] him while he [[H1931]] was hiding [[H2244]] in Samaria. [[H8111]] So they brought [[H935]] Ahaziah to [[H413]] Jehu [[H3058]] and killed him. [[H4191]] They buried him, [[H6912]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] “He [[H1931]] is the grandson [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] who [[H834]] sought [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] his heart. [[H3824]] So no one [was left] [[H369]] from the house [[H1004]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] with [[H6113]] the strength [[H3581]] to rule the kingdom. [[H4467]] 
10 When Athaliah [[H6271]] the mother [[H517]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] her son [[H1121]] was dead, [[H4191]] she proceeded [[H6965]] to annihilate [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the royal [[H4467]] heirs [[H2233]] of the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
11 But Jehoshabeath [[H3090]] daughter [[H1323]] of King [Jehoram] [[H4428]] [took] Joash [[H3101]] son [[H1121]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] and stole him away [[H1589]] from among [[H8432]] the sons [[H1121]] of the king [[H4428]] [who were] being murdered, [[H4191]] and she put [[H5414]] him [[H853]] and his nurse [[H3243]] in a bedroom. [[H2315]] Because Jehoshabeath, [[H3090]] the daughter [[H1323]] of King [[H4428]] Jehoram [[H3088]] and the wife [[H802]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest, [[H3548]] was [[H1961]] Ahaziahs [[H274]] sister, [[H269]] she hid Joash [[H5641]] from [[H6440]] Athaliah [[H6271]] so that she could not [[H3808]] kill him. [[H4191]] 
12 And [Joash] remained [[H1961]] hidden [[H2244]] with them [[H854]] in the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] for six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] while Athaliah [[H6271]] ruled [[H4427]] the land. [[H776]]
