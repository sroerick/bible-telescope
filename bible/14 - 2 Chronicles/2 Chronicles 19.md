1 Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] returned [[H7725]] safely [[H7965]] to [[H413]] his home [[H1004]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
2 Then Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Hanani [[H2607]] the seer [[H2374]] went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] confront [[H6440]] him and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] “Do you help [[H5826]] the wicked [[H7563]] and love [[H157]] those who hate [[H8130]] the LORD? [[H3068]] Because of this, [[H2063]] the wrath [[H7110]] of the LORD [is] [[H3068]] upon you. [[H5921]] 
3 However, [[H61]] some [[H1697]] good [[H2896]] is found [[H4672]] in you, [[H5973]] for [[H3588]] you have removed [[H1197]] the Asherah poles [[H842]] from [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] and have set [[H3559]] your heart [[H3824]] to seek [[H1875]] God.” [[H430]] 
4 Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] lived [[H3427]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and once again [[H7725]] he went out [[H3318]] among the people [[H5971]] from  Beersheba [[H884]] to [[H5704]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and turned them back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
5 He appointed [[H5975]] judges [[H8199]] in the land, [[H776]] in each of [[H3605]] the fortified [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
6 Then he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the judges, [[H8199]] “Consider carefully [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] you [[H859]] do, [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] you are not [[H3808]] judging [[H8199]] for man, [[H120]] but [[H3588]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] who is with you [[H5973]] when you render judgment. [[H4941]] 
7 And now, [[H6258]] may the fear [[H6343]] of the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] upon you. [[H5921]] Be careful [[H8104]] what you do, [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] with [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] there is no [[H369]] injustice, [[H5766]] partiality, [[H4856]] or bribery.” [[H4727]] 
8 In Jerusalem [[H3389]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] also [[H1571]] appointed [[H5975]] some of [[H4480]] the Levites, [[H3881]] priests, [[H3548]] and heads [[H7218]] of the Israelite [[H3478]] families [[H1]] to judge [[H4941]] on behalf of the LORD [[H3069]] and to settle disputes. [[H7379]] And they lived [[H7725]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
9 He commanded them, [[H6680]] saying, [[H559]] “You must serve [[H6213]] faithfully [[H530]] and wholeheartedly [[H8003]] in the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
10 For every [[H3605]] dispute [[H7379]] that [[H834]] comes [[H935]] before you [[H5921]] from your brothers [[H251]] who dwell [[H3427]] in their cities— [[H5892]] whether [[H996]] of bloodshed [[H1818]] or offenses [[H1818]] against [[H996]] the law, [[H8451]] commandment, [[H4687]] statutes, [[H2706]] or judgments— [[H4941]] you are to warn them, [[H2094]] so that they will not [[H3808]] incur guilt [[H816]] before the LORD [[H3068]] and wrath [[H7110]] will not come [[H1961]] upon you [[H5921]] and [[H5921]] your brothers. [[H251]] Do [[H6213]] this, [[H3541]] and you will not [[H3808]] incur guilt. [[H816]] 
11 Note that [[H2009]] Amariah, [[H568]] the chief [[H7218]] priest, [[H3548]] will be over you [[H5921]] in all [[H3605]] that pertains [[H1697]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and Zebadiah [[H2069]] son [[H1121]] of Ishmael, [[H3458]] the ruler [[H5057]] of the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] in all [[H3605]] that pertains [[H1697]] to the king. [[H4428]] And the Levites [[H3881]] [will serve as] officers [[H7860]] before you. [[H6440]] Act [[H6213]] resolutely; [[H2388]] may the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] the upright. [[H2896]]
