1 The [[G3588]] elder, [[G4245]] To [the] chosen [[G1588]] lady [[G2959]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] children, [[G5043]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] love [[G25]] in [[G1722]] [the] truth— [[G225]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] I [[G1473]] alone, [[G3441]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] truth— [[G225]] 
2 because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] that [[G3588]] abides [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] will be [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] us [[G1473]] forever: [[G165]] 
3 Grace, [[G5485]] mercy, [[G1656]] [and] peace [[G1515]] be [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] us [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] truth [[G225]] and [[G2532]] love [[G26]] from [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] from [[G3844]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] 
4 I was overjoyed [[G5463]] to [[G3754]] find [[G2147]] [some] of [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] children [[G5043]] walking [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] [the] truth, [[G225]] just as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has commanded [[G1785]] [us]. [[G2983]] 
5 And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I urge [[G2065]] you, [[G4771]] [dear] lady— [[G2959]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] a new [[G2537]] commandment [[G1785]] to you, [[G4771]] but [[G235]] [one] [[G3739]] we have had [[G2192]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning— [[G746]] that [[G2443]] we love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]] 
6 And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] love, [[G26]] that [[G2443]] we walk [[G4043]] according to [[G2596]] His [[G846]] commandments. [[G1785]] This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] very [[G2531]] commandment [[G1785]] you have heard [[G191]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning, [[G746]] that [[G2443]] you must walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] [love]. [[G846]] 
7 For [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] deceivers [[G4108]] have gone out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] refusing [[G3361]] to confess [[G3670]] the coming of [[G2064]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] in [[G1722]] [the] flesh. [[G4561]] Any such [ person ] [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] deceiver [[G4108]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] antichrist. [[G500]] 
8 Watch [[G991]] yourselves, [[G1438]] so that [[G2443]] you do not lose [[G622]] what [[G3739]] we have worked for, [[G2038]] [that] [[G235]] you may be fully rewarded. [[G618]] 
9 Anyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] runs ahead [[G4254]] without [[G3361]] remaining [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] teaching [[G1322]] of Christ [[G5547]] does not have [[G2192]] God. [[G2316]] Whoever [[G3588]] remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] [His] [[G3588]] teaching [[G1322]] has [[G2192]] both [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son. [[G5207]] 
10 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] comes [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] [but] [[G2532]] does not bring [[G5342]] this [[G3778]] teaching, [[G1322]] {do} not [[G3361]] receive [[G2983]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] [your] home [[G3614]] [or] [[G3361]] even [[G2532]] greet [[G3004]] him. [[G846]] 
11 Whoever [[G3588]] greets [[G3004]] [such a person] [[G846]] shares [[G2841]] in [[G3588]] his [[G846]] evil [[G4190]] deeds. [[G2041]] 
12 I have [[G2192]] many things [[G4183]] to write [[G1125]] you, [[G4771]] [but] I would prefer [[G1014]] not [[G3756]] to use [[G1223]] paper [[G5489]] and [[G2532]] ink. [[G3188]] Instead, [[G235]] I hope [[G1679]] to come [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] speak [[G2980]] with [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] [face] [[G4750]] to [[G4314]] [face], [[G4750]] so that [[G2443]] our [[G1473]] joy [[G5479]] may be [[G1510]] complete. [[G4137]] 
13 The [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of your [[G4771]] elect [[G1588]] sister [[G79]] send you greetings. [[G782]]
