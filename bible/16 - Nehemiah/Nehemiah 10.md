29 hereby join [[H2388]] with [[H5921]] their noble [[H117]] brothers [[H251]] and commit [[H935]] themselves with a sworn [[H7621]] oath [[H423]] to follow [[H1980]] the Law [[H8451]] of God [[H430]] given [[H5414]] through [[H3027]] [His] [[H430]] servant [[H5650]] Moses [[H4872]] and to carefully [[H8104]] obey [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the commandments, [[H4687]] ordinances, [[H4941]] and statutes [[H2706]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our Lord. [[H136]] 
30 We will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] our daughters {in marriage} [[H1323]] to the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] and we will not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] their daughters [[H1323]] for our sons. [[H1121]] 
31 When the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] bring [[H935]] merchandise [[H4728]] or any [[H3605]] kind of grain [[H7668]] to sell [[H4376]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] we will not [[H3808]] buy [[H3947]] from them [[H1992]] on a Sabbath day [[H7676]] or holy [[H6944]] day. [[H3117]] Every seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] we will let the fields lie fallow, [[H5203]] and will cancel every [[H3605]] debt. [[H4855]] 
32 We also place [[H5975]] ourselves [[H5921]] under [[H5921]] the obligation [[H4687]] to contribute [[H5414]] a third [[H7992]] of a shekel [[H8255]] yearly [[H8141]] for the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of our God: [[H430]] 
33 for the showbread, [[H3899]] for the regular [[H8548]] grain offerings [[H4503]] and burnt offerings, [[H5930]] for the Sabbath offerings, [[H7676]] for the New Moon [[H2320]] and appointed feasts, [[H4150]] for the holy offerings, [[H6944]] for the sin offerings [[H2403]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and for all [[H3605]] the duties [[H4399]] of the house [[H1004]] of our God. [[H430]] 
34 We have cast [[H5307]] lots [[H1486]] among the priests, [[H3548]] Levites, [[H3881]] and people [[H5971]] for [[H5921]] the donation [[H7133]] of wood [[H6086]] by our families [[H1]] at the appointed [[H2163]] times [[H6256]] each year. [[H8141]] They are to bring it [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of our God [[H430]] to burn [[H1197]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] as it is written [[H3789]] in the Law. [[H8451]] 
35 We will also bring [[H935]] the firstfruits [[H1061]] of our land [[H127]] and of every [[H3605]] fruit [[H6529]] tree [[H6086]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] year [[H8141]] by year. [[H8141]] 
36 And [[H853]] we will bring [[H935]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of our sons [[H1121]] and our livestock, [[H929]] as [it is] written [[H3789]] in the Law, [[H8451]] and will bring the firstborn [[H1060]] of our herds [[H1241]] and flocks [[H6629]] to the house [[H1004]] of our God, [[H430]] to the priests [[H3548]] who minister [[H8334]] in the house [[H1004]] of our God. [[H430]] 
37 Moreover, [[H853]] we will bring [[H935]] to the priests [[H3548]] at [[H413]] the storerooms [[H3957]] of the house [[H1004]] of our God [[H430]] the firstfruits [[H7225]] of our dough, [[H6182]] of our grain offerings, [[H8641]] of the fruit [[H6529]] of all our [[H3605]] trees, [[H6086]] and of our new wine [[H8492]] and oil. [[H3323]] A tenth [[H4643]] of our produce [[H127]] belongs to the Levites, [[H3881]] for [they] [[H3881]] should receive tithes [[H6237]] in all [[H3605]] the towns [[H5892]] where we labor. [[H5656]] 
38 A priest [[H3548]] descended [[H1121]] from Aaron [[H175]] is to accompany [[H1961]] the Levites [[H3881]] when they [[H3881]] collect the tenth, [[H6237]] and the Levites [[H3881]] are to bring [[H5927]] a tenth [[H4643]] of these tithes [[H4643]] to [[H413]] the storerooms [[H3957]] of the treasury [[H1004]] in the house [[H1004]] of our God. [[H430]] 
39 For [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and the Levites [[H1121]] are to bring [[H935]] the contributions [[H8641]] of grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and oil [[H3323]] to [[H413]] the storerooms [[H3957]] where [[H8033]] the articles [[H3627]] of the sanctuary [are kept] [[H4720]] and where the ministering [[H8334]] priests, [[H3548]] the gatekeepers, [[H7778]] and the singers [stay]. [[H7891]] Thus we will not [[H3808]] neglect [[H5800]] the house [[H1004]] of our God. [[H430]]
