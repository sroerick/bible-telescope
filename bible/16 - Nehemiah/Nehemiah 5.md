# Nehemiah 5
[[Nehemiah 4|←]] • [[Nehemiah 6|→]]
1 About this time there was [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] outcry [[H6818]] from the people [[H5971]] and their wives [[H802]] against [[H413]] their fellow [[H251]] Jews. [[H3064]] 
2 Some [[H834]] were saying, [[H559]] “We [[H587]] [and] our sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] are numerous. [[H7227]] We must get [[H3947]] grain [[H1715]] to eat [[H398]] and live.” [[H2421]] 
3 Others [[H834]] were saying, [[H559]] “We [[H587]] are mortgaging [[H6148]] our fields, [[H7704]] our vineyards, [[H3754]] and our homes [[H1004]] to get [[H3947]] grain [[H1715]] during the famine.” [[H7458]] 
4 Still others [[H834]] were saying, [[H559]] “We have borrowed [[H3867]] money [to pay] [[H3701]] the king's [[H4428]] tax [[H4060]] [on] our fields [[H7704]] and vineyards. [[H3754]] 
5 We and our children [[H1121]] are just like our countrymen [[H251]] and their children, [[H1121]] yet we [[H587]] are subjecting [[H3533]] our sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] to slavery. [[H5650]] Some of [[H3426]] our daughters [[H1323]] are already enslaved, [[H3533]] but we are powerless [to redeem them] [[H369]] because our fields [[H7704]] and vineyards [[H3754]] belong to others.” [[H312]] 
6 When [[H834]] I heard [[H8085]] their outcry [[H2201]] and these [[H428]] complaints, [[H1697]] I became extremely [[H3966]] angry, [[H2734]] 
7 and after serious [[H3820]] thought [[H4427]] I rebuked [[H7378]] the nobles [[H2715]] and officials, [[H5461]] saying, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] are exacting [[H5383]] usury [[H5378]] from your own brothers!” [[H251]] So I called [[H5414]] a large [[H1419]] assembly [[H6952]] against them [[H5921]] 
8 and said, [[H559]] “We [[H587]] have done our best [[H1767]] to buy back [[H7069]] our Jewish [[H3064]] brothers [[H251]] who were sold [[H4376]] to foreigners, [[H1471]] but now you [[H859]] are selling [[H4376]] your own brothers, [[H251]] that they may be sold back [[H4376]] to us!”  But they remained silent, [[H2790]] for they could find [[H4672]] nothing [[H3808]] to say. [[H1696]] 
9 So I continued, [[H559]] “What [[H834]] you [[H859]] are doing [[H6213]] is not [[H3808]] right. [[H2896]] Shouldn’t [[H3808]] you walk [[H1980]] in the fear [[H3374]] of our God [[H430]] to avoid the reproach [[H2781]] of our foreign [[H1471]] enemies? [[H341]] 
10 I, [[H589]] as well as [[H1571]] my brothers [[H251]] and my servants, [[H5288]] have been lending [[H5383]] [the people]  money [[H3701]] and grain. [[H1715]] Please, [[H4994]] let us stop [[H5800]] this [[H2088]] usury. [[H4855]] 
11 Please [[H4994]] restore [[H7725]] to them  immediately [[H3117]] their fields, [[H7704]] vineyards, [[H3754]] olive groves, [[H2132]] and houses, [[H1004]] along with the percentage [[H3967]] of the money, [[H3701]] grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and olive oil [[H3323]] that [[H834]] you [[H859]] have been assessing [[H5383]] them.”  
12 “We will restore [it],” [[H7725]] they replied, [[H559]] “and will require [[H1245]] nothing [[H3808]] more from them. [[H1992]] We will do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] you [[H859]] say.” [[H559]] So I summoned [[H7121]] the priests [[H3548]] and required [of the nobles and officials] an oath that they [[H7650]] would do [[H6213]] what they had promised. [[H1697]] 
13 I also [[H1571]] shook out [[H5287]] the folds of my robe [[H2684]] and said, [[H559]] “May God [[H430]] likewise [[H3602]] shake [[H5287]] out of his House [[H1004]] and possession [[H3018]] every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] who [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] keep [[H6965]] this [[H2088]] promise. [[H1697]] May [such a man] be [[H1961]] shaken out [[H5287]] and have nothing!” [[H7386]] The whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] said, [[H559]] “Amen,” [[H543]] and they praised [[H1984]] the LORD. [[H3069]] And the people [[H5971]] did [[H6213]] as they had promised. [[H1697]] 
14 Furthermore, [[H1571]] from the day [[H3117]] King [[H4428]] Artaxerxes [[H783]] appointed [[H6680]] me to be [[H1961]] their governor [[H6346]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] from his twentieth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] until [[H5704]] his thirty-second [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] (12 [[H8147]] years total), [[H8141]] neither I [[H589]] nor my brothers [[H251]] ate [[H398]] the food [[H3899]] allotted to the governor. [[H6346]] 
15 The governors [[H6346]] before me [[H6440]] had heavily burdened [[H3513]] the people, [[H5971]] taking [[H3947]] from them [[H1992]] bread [[H3899]] and wine [[H3196]] plus [[H310]] forty [[H705]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver. [[H3701]] Their servants [[H5288]] also [[H1571]] oppressed [[H7980]] the people, [[H5971]] but I [[H589]] did not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] this [[H3651]] because [[H6440]] of my fear [[H3374]] of God. [[H430]] 
16 Instead, [[H1571]] I devoted myself [[H2388]] to the construction [[H4399]] of the [[H2063]] wall, [[H2346]] and all [[H3605]] my servants [[H5288]] were gathered [[H6908]] there [[H8033]] for [[H5921]] the work; [[H4399]] we did not [[H3808]] acquire [[H7069]] any land. [[H7704]] 
17 There were 150 [[H3967]] Jews [[H3064]] and officials [[H5461]] at [[H5921]] my table, [[H7979]] besides the guests [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the surrounding [[H5439]] nations [[H1471]] 
18 Each [[H259]] day, [[H3117]] one [[H259]] ox, [[H7794]] six [[H8337]] choice [[H1305]] sheep, [[H6629]] and some fowl [[H6833]] were prepared for me, [[H6213]] and once every [[H996]] ten [[H6235]] days [[H3117]] an abundance [[H7235]] of all kinds [[H3605]] of wine was provided. [[H3196]] But I did not [[H3808]] demand [[H1245]] the food [[H3899]] allotted to the governor, [[H6346]] because [[H3588]] the burden [[H5656]] on [[H5921]] the [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] was so heavy. [[H3513]] 
19 Remember [[H2142]] me  favorably, [[H2896]] O my God, [[H430]] for all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] for [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]
