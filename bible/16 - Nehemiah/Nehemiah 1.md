# Nehemiah 1
[[Ezra 10|←]] • [[Nehemiah 2|→]]
1 [These are] the words [[H1697]] of Nehemiah [[H5166]] son [[H1121]] of Hacaliah: [[H2446]] In the month [[H2320]] of Chislev, [[H3691]] in the twentieth [[H6242]] year, [[H8141]] while I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] in the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa, [[H7800]] 
2 Hanani, [[H2607]] one [[H259]] of my brothers, [[H251]] arrived [[H935]] with men [[H376]] from Judah. [[H3063]] So I questioned them [[H7592]] about [[H5921]] the remnant [[H6413]] of the Jews [[H3064]] who [[H834]] had survived [[H7604]] the exile, [[H7628]] and also about [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
3 And they told [[H559]] me,  “The remnant [[H7604]] who [[H834]] survived [[H7604]] the exile [[H7628]] [are] there [[H8033]] in the province, [[H4082]] in great [[H1419]] trouble [[H7451]] and disgrace. [[H2781]] The wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] [is] broken down, [[H6555]] and its gates [[H8179]] [are burned] [[H3341]] with fire.” [[H784]] 
4 When I heard [[H8085]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] I sat down [[H3427]] and wept. [[H1058]] I mourned [[H56]] for days, [[H3117]] fasting [[H6684]] and praying [[H6419]] before [[H6440]] the God [[H430]] of heaven. [[H8064]] 
5 Then I said: [[H559]] “I pray, [[H577]] O LORD [[H3069]] God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]] the great [[H1419]] and awesome [[H3372]] God [[H410]] who keeps [[H8104]] His covenant [[H1285]] of loving devotion [[H2617]] with those who love Him [[H157]] and keep [[H8104]] His commandments, [[H4687]] 
6 may Your eyes [[H5869]] be [[H1961]] open [[H6605]] and Your ears [[H241]] be attentive [[H7183]] to hear [[H8085]] the prayer [[H8605]] that [[H834]] I, [[H595]] Your servant, [[H5650]] now [[H3117]] pray [[H6419]] before You [[H6440]] day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] for [[H5921]] Your servants, [[H5650]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] I confess [[H3034]] the sins [[H2403]] we Israelites [[H1121]] have committed [[H2398]] against You.  Both I [[H589]] and my fathers [[H1]] house [[H1004]] have sinned. [[H2398]] 
7 We have behaved corruptly [[H2254]] against You  and have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the commandments, [[H4687]] statutes, [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] that [[H834]] You gave [[H6680]] Your servant [[H5650]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
8 Remember, [[H2142]] I pray, [[H4994]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] You commanded [[H6680]] Your servant [[H5650]] Moses [[H4872]] when You said, [[H559]] ‘If you [[H859]] are unfaithful, [[H4603]] I [[H589]] will scatter [[H6327]] you [[H853]] among the nations, [[H5971]] 
9 but [if] you return [[H7725]] to Me [[H413]] to keep [[H8104]] and practice [[H6213]] My commandments, [[H4687]] then even if [[H518]] your exiles [[H5080]] have been [[H1961]] banished to the ends [[H7097]] of the earth, [[H8064]] I will gather them [[H6908]] from there [[H8033]] and bring [[H935]] them to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] I have chosen [[H977]] as a dwelling [[H7931]] for [[H853]] My Name.’ [[H8034]] 
10 They [[H1992]] are Your servants [[H5650]] and Your people. [[H5971]] You redeemed [[H6299]] them [[H834]] by Your great [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and mighty [[H2389]] hand. [[H3027]] 
11 O Lord, [[H136]] may Your ear [[H241]] be [[H1961]] attentive [[H7183]] to [[H413]] the prayer [[H8605]] of Your servant [[H5650]] and to [[H413]] the prayers [[H8605]] of Your servants [[H5650]] who delight [[H2655]] in reverence [[H3372]] of Your name. [[H8034]] Give Your servant [[H5650]] success [[H6743]] this day, [[H3117]] I pray, [[H4994]] and grant him [[H5414]] mercy [[H7356]] in the sight [[H6440]] of this [[H2088]] man. [[H376]] (For I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] the cupbearer [[H4945]] to the king.) [[H4428]]
