# Nehemiah 7
[[Nehemiah 6|←]] • [[Nehemiah 8|→]]
1 When [[H834]] the wall [[H2346]] had been rebuilt [[H1129]] and I had set the doors [[H1817]] in place, [[H5975]] the gatekeepers, [[H7778]] singers, [[H7891]] and Levites [[H3881]] were appointed. [[H6485]] 
2 Then I put my brother [[H251]] Hanani [[H2607]] in charge [[H6680]] of [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] along with Hananiah [[H2608]] the commander [[H8269]] of the fortress, [[H1002]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was a faithful [[H571]] man [[H376]] who feared [[H3372]] God [[H430]] more than most. [[H7227]] 
3 And  I told [[H559]] them,  “Do not [[H3808]] open [[H6605]] the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] until [[H5704]] the sun [[H8121]] is hot. [[H2527]] While [[H5704]] the guards [[H1992]] are on duty, [[H5975]] keep the doors [[H1817]] shut [[H1479]] and securely fastened. [[H270]] And appoint [[H5975]] the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] as guards, [[H4931]] some [[H376]] at their posts [[H4929]] and some [[H376]] at [[H5048]] their own homes. [[H1004]] 
4 Now the city [[H5892]] was large [[H1419]] and spacious, [[H7342]] but there were few [[H4592]] people [[H5971]] in it, [[H8432]] and the houses [[H1004]] had not yet [[H369]] been rebuilt. [[H1129]] 
5 Then my God [[H430]] put [[H5414]] into [[H413]] my heart [[H3820]] to assemble [[H6908]] the nobles, [[H2715]] the officials, [[H5461]] and the people [[H5971]] to be enrolled by genealogy. [[H3187]] I found [[H4672]] the genealogical [[H3188]] register [[H5612]] of those who had first returned, [[H5927]] and I found [[H4672]] the following written [[H3789]] in it:  
6 These [[H428]] are the people [[H1121]] of the province [[H4082]] who came up [[H5927]] from the captivity [[H7628]] of the exiles [[H1473]] carried away [[H1540]] to Babylon [[H894]] by Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] [its] king. [[H4428]] They returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah, [[H3063]] each [[H376]] to his own town, [[H5892]]

61 The following [[H428]] came up [[H5927]] from Tel-melah, [[H8528]] Tel-harsha, [[H8521]] Cherub, [[H3743]] Addon, [[H114]] and Immer, [[H564]] but could not [[H3808]] prove [[H5046]] that their families [[H1004]] were descended [[H2233]] from Israel: [[H3478]] 
62 the descendants [[H1121]] of Delaiah, [[H1806]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Tobiah, [[H2900]] and the descendants [[H1121]] of Nekoda, [[H5353]] 642 [in all]. [[H8337]] 
63 And from [[H4480]] among the priests: [[H3548]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Hobaiah, [[H2252]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Hakkoz, [[H6976]] and the descendants [[H1121]] of Barzillai [[H1271]] (who [[H834]] had married [[H3947]] a daughter [[H1323]] of Barzillai [[H1271]] the Gileadite [[H1569]] and was called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] their name). [[H8034]] 
64 These [men] [[H428]] searched for [[H1245]] their family records, [[H3791]] but they could not [[H3808]] find them [[H4672]] and so were excluded [[H1351]] from [[H4480]] the priesthood {as unclean}. [[H3550]] 
65 The governor [[H8660]] ordered [[H559]] them not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] the most holy things [[H6944]] until [[H5704]] there was [[H5975]] a priest [[H3548]] to consult the Urim [[H224]] and Thummim. [[H8550]] 
66 The whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] [numbered] [[H259]] 42,360 {}, [[H702]] 
67 in addition to [[H905]] their 7,337 [[H7651]] menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H519]] as well as their 245 [[H3967]] male and female singers. [[H7891]] 
68 They had 736 horses, 245 mules,  
69 435 [[H702]] camels, [[H1581]] and 6,720 [[H8337]] donkeys. [[H2543]] 
70 Some of [[H7117]] the heads [[H7218]] of the families [[H1]] contributed [[H5414]] to the project. [[H4399]] The governor [[H8660]] gave [[H5414]] to the treasury [[H214]] 1,000 [[H505]] darics [[H1871]] of gold, [[H2091]] 50 [[H2572]] bowls, [[H4219]] and 530 [[H7970]] priestly [[H3548]] garments. [[H3801]] 
71 And some of the heads [[H7218]] of the families [[H1]] gave [[H5414]] to the treasury [[H214]] for the project [[H4399]] 20,000 [[H8147]] darics [[H1871]] of gold [[H2091]] and 2,200 [[H505]] minas [[H4488]] of silver. [[H3701]] 
72 The rest [[H7611]] of the people [[H5971]] gave [a total of] [[H5414]] 20,000 [[H8147]] darics [[H1871]] of gold, [[H2091]] 2,000 [[H505]] minas [[H4488]] of silver, [[H3701]] and 67 [[H8346]] priestly [[H3548]] garments. [[H3801]] 
73 So the priests, [[H3548]] Levites, [[H3881]] gatekeepers, [[H7778]] singers, [[H7891]] and temple servants, [[H5411]] along with some [[H4480]] of the people [[H5971]] and the rest of [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H3478]] settled [[H3427]] in their own towns. [[H5892]] And by the seventh [[H7637]] month [[H2320]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had settled in their towns. [[H5892]]
