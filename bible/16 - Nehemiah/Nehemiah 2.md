# Nehemiah 2
[[Nehemiah 1|←]] • [[Nehemiah 3|→]]
1 Now in the month [[H2320]] of Nisan, [[H5212]] in the twentieth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of King [[H4428]] Artaxerxes, [[H783]] when wine [[H3196]] was set before him, [[H6440]] I took [[H5375]] the wine [[H3196]] and gave [[H5414]] it to the king. [[H4428]] I had never [[H3808]] been [[H1961]] sad [[H7451]] in his presence, [[H6440]] 
2 so the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to me,  “Why [is] [[H4069]] your face [[H6440]] sad, [[H7451]] though you [are] [[H859]] not [[H369]] ill? [[H2470]] This [[H2088]] could only be [[H369]] sadness [[H7455]] of the heart.” [[H3820]] I was overwhelmed with fear [[H3372]] 
3 and replied [[H559]] to the king, [[H4428]] “May the king [[H4428]] live forever! [[H2421]] Why [[H4069]] should I not [[H3808]] be sad [[H7489]] when [[H834]] the city [[H5892]] where [[H1004]] my fathers [[H1]] are buried [[H6913]] lies in ruins, [[H2717]] and its gates [[H8179]] have been destroyed [[H398]] by fire?” [[H784]] 
4 “What [[H4100]] is your [[H859]] request?” [[H1245]] replied [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]] So I prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the God [[H430]] of heaven [[H8064]] 
5 and answered [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] “If [[H518]] it pleases [[H2895]] the king, [[H4428]] and if [[H518]] your servant [[H5650]] has found favor [[H3190]] in your sight, [[H6440]] I ask that [[H834]] you send me [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Judah, [[H3063]] to [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] where my fathers [[H1]] are buried, [[H6913]] so that I may rebuild it.” [[H1129]] 
6 Then the king, [[H4428]] with the queen [[H7694]] seated [[H3427]] beside him, [[H681]] asked [[H559]] me,  “How long [[H5704]] will your journey [[H4109]] take, [[H1961]] and when [[H4970]] will you return?” [[H7725]] So it pleased [[H3190]] the king [[H4428]] to send me, [[H7971]] and I set [[H5414]] a time. [[H2165]] 
7 I also said [[H559]] to [him], [[H4428]] “If [[H518]] it pleases [[H2895]] the king, [[H4428]] may letters [[H107]] be given [[H5414]] to me  for [[H5921]] the governors [[H6346]] west [[H5676]] of the Euphrates, [[H5104]] so that [[H834]] they will grant me safe passage [[H5674]] until [[H5704]] I reach [[H935]] Judah. [[H3063]] 
8 And may I have a letter [[H107]] to [[H413]] Asaph, [[H623]] keeper [[H8104]] of the king’s [[H834]] forest, [[H6508]] so that [[H834]] he will give [[H5414]] me  timber [[H6086]] to make beams [[H7136]] for [[H853]] the gates [[H8179]] of the citadel [[H1002]] to the temple, [[H1004]] for the city [[H5892]] wall, [[H2346]] and for the house [[H1004]] I will occupy.” [[H935]] And because the gracious [[H2896]] hand [[H3027]] of my God [[H430]] was upon me, [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] granted [[H5414]] my requests.  
9 Then I went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the governors [[H6346]] west [[H5676]] of the Euphrates [[H5104]] and gave [[H5414]] them  the king's [[H4428]] letters. [[H107]] The king [[H4428]] had also sent [[H7971]] army [[H2428]] officers [[H8269]] and cavalry [[H6571]] with me. [[H5973]] 
10 But when Sanballat [[H5571]] the Horonite [[H2772]] and Tobiah [[H2900]] the Ammonite [[H5984]] official [[H5650]] heard about this, [[H8085]] they were deeply [[H1419]] disturbed [[H7489]] that [[H834]] someone [[H120]] had come [[H935]] to seek [[H1245]] the well-being [[H2896]] of the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
11 After I arrived [[H935]] in [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and had been [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] 
12 I [[H589]] set out [[H6965]] at night [[H3915]] with [[H5973]] a few [[H4592]] men. [[H376]] I did not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] anyone [[H120]] what [[H4100]] my God [[H430]] had laid [[H5414]] on [[H413]] my heart [[H3820]] to do [[H6213]] for Jerusalem. [[H3389]] The only [[H3588]] animal [[H929]] with me [[H5973]] was the one [[H929]] on which [[H834]] I [[H589]] was riding. [[H7392]] 
13 So I went out [[H3318]] at night [[H3915]] through the Valley [[H1516]] Gate [[H8179]] toward [[H413]] the Well [[H5869]] of the Serpent [[H8577]] and the Dung [[H830]] Gate, [[H8179]] and I inspected [[H7663]] the walls [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] that [[H834]] had been broken down [[H6555]] and the gates [[H8179]] that had been destroyed [[H398]] by fire. [[H784]] 
14 Then I went on [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the Fountain [[H5869]] Gate [[H8179]] and the King’s [[H4428]] Pool, [[H1295]] but [there was] no [[H369]] room [[H4725]] for the animal [[H929]] under me [[H8478]] to get through; [[H5674]] 
15 so I [[H1961]] went up [[H5927]] the valley [[H5158]] by night [[H3915]] and [[H1961]] inspected [[H7663]] the wall. [[H2346]] Then I headed back [[H7725]] and reentered [[H935]] through the Valley [[H1516]] Gate. [[H8179]] 
16 The officials [[H5461]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] where [[H575]] I had gone [[H1980]] or what [[H4100]] I [[H589]] was doing, [[H6213]] for I had not [[H3808]] yet [[H5704]] told [[H5046]] the Jews [[H3064]] or priests [[H3548]] or nobles [[H2715]] or officials [[H5461]] or any others [[H3499]] who would be doing [[H6213]] the work. [[H4399]] 
17 Then I said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “You [[H859]] see [[H7200]] the trouble [[H7451]] we are in. [[H587]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] lies in ruins, [[H2717]] and its gates [[H8179]] have been burned down. [[H3341]] Come, [[H1980]] let us rebuild [[H1129]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] so that we will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] a disgrace.” [[H2781]] 
18 I also told [[H5046]] them  about [[H834]] the gracious [[H2896]] hand [[H3027]] of my God [[H430]] upon me, [[H5921]] and [[H637]] what [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] had said [[H559]] to me.  “Let us start [[H6965]] rebuilding,” [[H1129]] they replied, [[H559]] and they set [[H2388]] their hands [[H3027]] to [this] good [work]. [[H2896]] 
19 When Sanballat [[H5571]] the Horonite, [[H2772]] Tobiah [[H2900]] the Ammonite [[H5984]] official, [[H5650]] and Geshem [[H1654]] the Arab [[H6163]] heard about this, [[H8085]] they mocked [[H3932]] us  and ridiculed us, [[H959]] saying, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] is this [[H2088]] you are [[H859]] doing? [[H6213]] Are you [[H859]] rebelling [[H4775]] against [[H5921]] the king? [[H4428]] 
20 So I answered [[H7725]] them [[H853]] and said, [[H559]] “The God [[H430]] of heaven [[H8064]] is the One [[H1931]] who will grant us success. [[H6743]] We, [[H587]] His servants, [[H5650]] will start [[H6965]] rebuilding, [[H1129]] but you  have no [[H369]] portion, [[H2506]] right, [[H6666]] or claim [[H2146]] in Jerusalem.” [[H3389]]
