21 of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] Hashabiah; [[H2811]] [and] of Jedaiah, [[H3048]] Nethanel; [[H5417]] 
22 In the days [[H3117]] of Eliashib, [[H475]] Joiada, [[H3111]] Johanan, [[H3110]] and Jaddua, [[H3037]] the heads [[H7218]] of the families [[H1]] of the Levites [[H3881]] and priests [[H3548]] were recorded [[H3789]] during [[H5921]] the reign of [[H4438]] Darius [[H1867]] the Persian. [[H6542]] 
23 As for the descendants [[H1121]] of Levi, [[H3878]] the family [[H1]] heads [[H7218]] up to [[H5704]] the days [[H3117]] of Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Eliashib [[H475]] were recorded [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles. [[H1697]] 
24 The leaders [[H7218]] of the Levites [[H3881]] [were] Hashabiah, [[H2811]] Sherebiah, [[H8274]] and Jeshua [[H3442]] son [[H1121]] of Kadmiel, [[H6934]] along with their associates, [[H251]] [who stood] across from them [[H5048]] to give praise [[H1984]] and thanksgiving [[H3034]] as one section [[H4929]] alternated with [[H5980]] the other, [[H4929]] as prescribed [[H4687]] by David [[H1732]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] 
25 Mattaniah, [[H4983]] Bakbukiah, [[H1229]] Obadiah, [[H5662]] Meshullam, [[H4918]] Talmon, [[H2929]] [and] Akkub [[H6126]] [were] gatekeepers [[H7778]] who guarded [[H8104]] the storerooms [[H624]] at the gates. [[H8179]] 
26 They [[H428]] [served] in the days [[H3117]] of Joiakim [[H3113]] son [[H1121]] of Jeshua, [[H3442]] the son [[H1121]] of Jozadak, [[H3136]] and in the days [[H3117]] of Nehemiah [[H5166]] the governor [[H6346]] and Ezra [[H5830]] the priest [[H3548]] and scribe. [[H5608]] 
27 At the dedication [[H2598]] of the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the Levites [[H3881]] were sought out [[H1245]] from all [[H3605]] their homes [[H4725]] and brought [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] to celebrate [[H6213]] the joyous [[H8057]] dedication [[H2598]] with thanksgiving [[H8426]] and singing, [[H7892]] accompanied by cymbals, [[H4700]] harps, [[H5035]] and lyres. [[H3658]] 
28 The singers were also [[H7891]] assembled [[H622]] from [[H4480]] the region [[H3603]] around [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] from [[H4480]] the villages [[H2691]] of the Netophathites, [[H5200]] 
29 from Beth-gilgal, [[H1004]] and from the fields [[H7704]] of Geba [[H1387]] and Azmaveth, [[H5820]] for [[H3588]] [they] [[H7891]] had built [[H1129]] villages [[H2691]] for themselves [[H1992]] all around [[H5439]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
30 After the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] had purified themselves, [[H2891]] they purified [[H2891]] the people, [[H5971]] the gates, [[H8179]] and the wall. [[H2346]] 
31 Then I brought the leaders [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] up [[H5927]] on the wall, [[H2346]] and I appointed [[H5975]] two [[H8147]] great [[H1419]] thanksgiving [choirs]. [[H8426]] One was to proceed [[H8418]] along [[H5921]] the top of the wall [[H2346]] to the right, [[H3225]] toward the Dung [[H830]] Gate. [[H8179]] 
32 Hoshaiah [[H1955]] and half [[H2677]] the leaders [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] followed, [[H1980]] 
33 along with Azariah, [[H5838]] Ezra, [[H5830]] Meshullam, [[H4918]] 
34 Judah, [[H3063]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] 
35 and some of the priests [[H3548]] with trumpets, [[H2689]] and also Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1121]] of Jonathan, [[H3129]] the son [[H1121]] of Shemaiah, [[H8098]] the son [[H1121]] of Mattaniah, [[H4983]] the son [[H1121]] of Micaiah, [[H4320]] the son [[H1121]] of Zaccur, [[H2139]] the son [[H1121]] of Asaph, [[H623]] 
36 and his associates— [[H251]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] Azarel, [[H5832]] Milalai, [[H4450]] Gilalai, [[H1562]] Maai, [[H4597]] Nethanel, [[H5417]] Judah, [[H3063]] and Hanani— [[H2607]] with the musical [[H7892]] instruments [[H3627]] [prescribed by] David [[H1732]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] Ezra [[H5830]] the scribe [[H5608]] led the procession. [[H6440]] 
37 At [[H5921]] the Fountain [[H5869]] Gate [[H8179]] they climbed [[H5927]] the steps [[H4609]] of the City [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] on the ascent [[H4608]] to the wall [[H2346]] and passed above [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] to [[H5704]] the Water [[H4325]] Gate [[H8179]] on the east. [[H4217]] 
38 The second [[H8145]] thanksgiving [choir] [[H8426]] proceeded [[H1980]] to the left, [[H4136]] and I [[H589]] followed [[H310]] it with half [[H2677]] the people [[H5971]] along the top [[H5921]] of the wall, [[H2346]] past [[H5921]] the Tower [[H4026]] of the Ovens [[H8574]] to [[H5704]] the Broad [[H7342]] Wall, [[H2346]] 
39 over [[H5921]] the Gate [[H8179]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] the Jeshanah Gate, [[H3466]] the Fish [[H1709]] Gate, [[H8179]] the Tower [[H4026]] of Hananel, [[H2606]] and the Tower [[H4026]] of the Hundred, [[H3968]] as far [[H5704]] as the Sheep [[H6629]] Gate. [[H8179]] And they stopped [[H5975]] at the Gate [[H8179]] of the Guard. [[H4307]] 
40 The two [[H8147]] thanksgiving [choirs] [[H8426]] then stood [[H5975]] in the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] as did I, [[H589]] along with the half [[H2677]] of the officials [[H5461]] accompanying me, [[H5973]] 
41 as well as the priests [[H3548]] with their trumpets— [[H2689]] Eliakim, [[H471]] Maaseiah, [[H4641]] Miniamin, [[H4509]] Micaiah, [[H4320]] Elioenai, [[H454]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] and Hananiah— [[H2608]] 
42 and also Maaseiah, [[H4641]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] Eleazar, [[H499]] Uzzi, [[H5813]] Jehohanan, [[H3076]] Malchijah, [[H4441]] Elam, [[H5867]] and Ezer. [[H5829]] Then the choirs [[H7891]] sang out [[H8085]] under the direction [[H6496]] of Jezrahiah. [[H3156]] 
43 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they offered [[H2076]] great [[H1419]] sacrifices, [[H2077]] rejoicing [[H8055]] because [[H3588]] God [[H430]] had given them great [[H1419]] joy. [[H8055]] The women [[H802]] and children [[H3206]] also [[H1571]] rejoiced, [[H8055]] so that the joy [[H8057]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] was heard [[H8085]] from afar. [[H7350]] 
44 And on that same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] men [[H376]] were appointed [[H6485]] over [[H5921]] the rooms [[H5393]] that housed the supplies, [[H214]] contributions, [[H8641]] firstfruits, [[H7225]] and tithes. [[H4643]] The portions [specified] by [[H4521]] the Law [[H8451]] for the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] were gathered [[H3664]] into [these storerooms]  from the fields [[H7704]] of the villages, [[H5892]] because [[H3588]] Judah [[H3063]] rejoiced [[H8057]] over [[H5921]] the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] who were serving. [[H5975]] 
45 They performed [[H8104]] the service [[H4931]] of their God [[H430]] and the service [[H4931]] of purification, [[H2893]] along with the singers [[H7891]] and gatekeepers, [[H7778]] as David [[H1732]] and his son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] had prescribed. [[H4687]] 
46 For [[H3588]] long ago, [[H6924]] in the days [[H3117]] of David [[H1732]] and Asaph, [[H623]] there were directors [[H7218]] for the singers [[H7891]] and for the songs [[H7892]] of praise [[H8416]] and thanksgiving [[H3034]] to God. [[H430]] 
47 So in the days [[H3117]] of Zerubbabel [[H2216]] and Nehemiah, [[H5166]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] contributed [[H5414]] the daily portions [[H4521]] for the singers [[H7891]] and gatekeepers. [[H7778]] They also set aside [[H6942]] daily [[H3117]] portions [[H1697]] for the Levites, [[H3881]] and the Levites [[H3881]] set aside [[H6942]] daily portions for the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron.
