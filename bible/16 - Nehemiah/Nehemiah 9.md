# Nehemiah 9
[[Nehemiah 8|←]] • [[Nehemiah 10|→]]
1 On the twenty-fourth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the same [[H2088]] month, [[H2320]] the Israelites [[H1121]] gathered together, [[H622]] fasting [[H6685]] and wearing sackcloth, [[H8242]] with dust [[H127]] on their heads. [[H5921]] 
2 Those of Israelite [[H3478]] descent [[H2233]] separated themselves [[H914]] from all [[H3605]] the foreigners, [[H1121]] and they stood [[H5975]] and confessed [[H3034]] their sins [[H2403]] and the iniquities [[H5771]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
3 While they stood [[H6965]] in [[H5921]] their places, [[H5977]] they read [[H7121]] from the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] for a quarter [[H7243]] of the day, [[H3117]] and they spent another quarter of the day [[H7243]] in confession [[H3034]] and worship [[H7812]] of the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]] 
4 And the Levites— [[H3881]] Jeshua, [[H3442]] Bani, [[H1137]] Kadmiel, [[H6934]] Shebaniah, [[H7645]] Bunni, [[H1138]] Sherebiah, [[H8274]] Bani, [[H1137]] and Chenani— [[H3662]] stood [[H6965]] on [[H5921]] the raised platform [[H4608]] and cried out [[H2199]] in a loud [[H1419]] voice [[H6963]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]] 
5 Then the Levites— [[H3881]] Jeshua, [[H3442]] Kadmiel, [[H6934]] Bani, [[H1137]] Hashabneiah, [[H2813]] Sherebiah, [[H8274]] Hodiah, [[H1941]] Shebaniah, [[H7645]] and Pethahiah— [[H6611]] said: [[H559]] “Stand up [[H6965]] [and] bless [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] from [[H4480]] everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting: [[H5769]] ‘Blessed be [[H1288]] Your glorious [[H3519]] name, [[H8034]] and may it be exalted [[H7311]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] blessing [[H1293]] and praise. [[H8416]] 
6 You [[H859]] alone [[H905]] are the LORD. [[H3068]] You [[H859]] created [[H6213]] the heavens, [[H8064]] the highest heavens [[H8064]] with all [[H3605]] their host, [[H6635]] the earth [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] is on it, [[H5921]] the seas [[H3220]] and all [[H3605]] that is [[H834]] in them.  You give life [[H2421]] to all things, [[H3605]] and the heavenly [[H8064]] host [[H6635]] worships You. [[H7812]] 
7 You [[H859]] are the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] who [[H834]] chose [[H977]] Abram, [[H87]] who brought him [[H3318]] out of Ur [[H218]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] and gave him [[H7760]] the name [[H8034]] Abraham. [[H85]] 
8 You found [[H4672]] his heart [[H3824]] faithful [[H539]] before You, [[H6440]] and made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with him [[H5973]] to give [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites [[H3669]] and Hittites, [[H2850]] of the Amorites [[H567]] and Perizzites, [[H6522]] of the Jebusites [[H2983]] and Girgashites, [[H1622]] to give it [[H5414]] to his descendants. [[H2233]] You have kept [[H6965]] Your promise, [[H1697]] because [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are righteous. [[H6662]] 
9 You saw [[H7200]] the oppression [[H6040]] of our fathers [[H1]] in Egypt; [[H4714]] You heard [[H8085]] their cry [[H2201]] at [[H5921]] the Red [[H5488]] Sea. [[H3220]] 
10 You performed [[H5414]] signs [[H226]] and wonders [[H4159]] against Pharaoh, [[H6547]] all [[H3605]] his officials, [[H5650]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of his land, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] You knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] they had acted with arrogance [[H2102]] against [our fathers]. [[H5921]] You made [[H6213]] a name for Yourself [[H8034]] that endures to this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
11 You divided [[H1234]] the sea [[H3220]] before them, [[H6440]] and they crossed [[H5674]] through [[H8432]] it [[H3220]] on dry ground. [[H3004]] You hurled [[H7993]] their pursuers [[H7291]] into the depths [[H4688]] like [[H3644]] a stone [[H68]] into raging waters. [[H4325]] 
12 You led [[H5148]] them with a pillar [[H5982]] of cloud [[H6051]] by day, [[H3119]] and a pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] by night, [[H3915]] to light [[H215]] for them the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] they should travel. [[H1980]] 
13 You came down [[H3381]] on [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Sinai, [[H5514]] and spoke [[H1696]] to them [[H5973]] from heaven. [[H8064]] You gave [[H5414]] them  just [[H3477]] ordinances, [[H4941]] TRUE [[H571]] laws, [[H8451]] and good [[H2896]] statutes [[H2706]] and commandments. [[H4687]] 
14 You revealed [[H3045]] to them  Your holy [[H6944]] Sabbath, [[H7676]] and gave [[H6680]] them  commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2706]] and laws [[H8451]] through [[H3027]] Your servant [[H5650]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
15 In their hunger [[H7458]] You provided [[H5414]] bread [[H3899]] from heaven; [[H8064]] in their thirst [[H6772]] You brought [[H3318]] water [[H4325]] from the rock. [[H5553]] You told [[H559]] them to go in [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] You had sworn [[H5375]] to give [[H5414]] them.  
16 But they [[H1992]] and our fathers [[H1]] became arrogant [[H2102]] and stiff-necked [[H7185]] and did not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
17 They refused [[H3985]] to listen [[H8085]] and failed [[H3808]] to remember [[H2142]] the wonders [[H6381]] You performed [[H6213]] among them. [[H5973]] They stiffened [[H7185]] their necks [[H6203]] and appointed [[H5414]] a leader [[H7218]] to return them [[H7725]] to their bondage. [[H5659]] But You [[H859]] are a forgiving [[H5547]] God, [[H433]] gracious [[H2587]] and compassionate, [[H7349]] slow [[H750]] to anger [[H639]] and rich [[H7227]] in loving devotion, [[H2617]] and You did not [[H3808]] forsake them. [[H5800]] 
18 Even [[H637]] after [[H3588]] they had cast [[H6213]] for themselves  an image [[H4541]] of a calf [[H5695]] and said, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] is your God [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought you up [[H5927]] out of Egypt,” [[H4714]] and they had committed [[H6213]] terrible [[H1419]] blasphemies, [[H5007]] 
19 You, [[H859]] because of Your great [[H7227]] compassion, [[H7356]] did not [[H3808]] forsake them [[H5800]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] By day [[H3119]] the pillar [[H5982]] of cloud [[H6051]] never [[H3808]] turned away [[H5493]] from guiding them [[H5148]] on their path; [[H1870]] and by the night [[H3915]] the pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] illuminated [[H215]] the way [[H1870]] they should go. [[H1980]] 
20 You gave [[H5414]] Your good [[H2896]] Spirit [[H7307]] to instruct them. [[H7919]] You did not [[H3808]] withhold [[H4513]] Your manna [[H4478]] from their mouths, [[H6310]] and You gave [[H5414]] them water [[H4325]] for their thirst. [[H6772]] 
21 For forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] You sustained them [[H3557]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] [so that] they lacked [[H2637]] nothing. [[H3808]] Their clothes [[H8008]] did not [[H3808]] wear out, [[H1086]] and their feet [[H7272]] did not [[H3808]] swell. [[H1216]] 
22 You gave [[H5414]] them kingdoms [[H4467]] and peoples [[H5971]] and allotted [[H2505]] to them every corner of the land. [[H6285]] So they took [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] and [[H776]] of Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan. [[H1316]] 
23 You multiplied [[H7235]] their descendants [[H1121]] like the stars [[H3556]] of heaven [[H8064]] and brought [[H935]] them to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] You had told [[H559]] their fathers [[H1]] to enter [[H935]] and possess. [[H3423]] 
24 So their descendants [[H1121]] went in [[H935]] and possessed [[H3423]] the land. [[H776]] You subdued [[H3665]] before them [[H6440]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] dwelling [[H3427]] in the land; [[H776]] You handed their kings [[H4428]] and peoples [[H5971]] over to [[H5414]] them, [[H3027]] to do [[H6213]] with them  as they wished. [[H7522]] 
25 They captured [[H3920]] fortified cities [[H5892]] and fertile [[H8082]] land [[H127]] and took [[H3423]] houses [[H1004]] full [[H4392]] of all [[H3605]] goods, [[H2898]] wells [[H953]] [already] dug, [[H2672]] vineyards, [[H3754]] olive groves, [[H2132]] and fruit [[H3978]] trees [[H6086]] in abundance. [[H7230]] So they ate [[H398]] and were filled; [[H7646]] they grew fat [[H8080]] and delighted [[H5727]] in Your great [[H1419]] goodness. [[H2898]] 
26 But they were disobedient [[H4784]] and rebelled [[H4775]] against You;  they flung [[H7993]] Your law [[H8451]] behind [[H310]] their backs. [[H1458]] They killed [[H2026]] Your prophets [[H5030]] who [[H834]] had admonished [[H5749]] them  to turn back [[H7725]] to You. [[H413]] They committed [[H6213]] terrible [[H1419]] blasphemies. [[H5007]] 
27 So You delivered them [[H5414]] into the hands [[H3027]] of their enemies, [[H6862]] who oppressed [[H3334]] them.  And in their time [[H6256]] of distress, [[H6869]] they cried out [[H6817]] to You, [[H413]] and You [[H859]] heard them [[H8085]] from heaven. [[H8064]] In Your abundant [[H7227]] compassion [[H7356]] You gave [[H5414]] them deliverers, [[H3467]] who rescued them [[H3467]] from the hands [[H3027]] of their enemies. [[H6862]] 
28 But as soon as they had rest, [[H5117]] they again [[H7725]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in Your sight. [[H6440]] So You abandoned them [[H5800]] to the hands [[H3027]] of their enemies, [[H341]] who had dominion [[H7287]] over them.  When they cried out [[H2199]] to You again, [[H7725]] You [[H859]] heard [[H8085]] from heaven, [[H8064]] And You delivered them [[H5337]] many [[H7227]] times [[H6256]] in Your compassion. [[H7356]] 
29 You admonished [[H5749]] them  to turn back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Your law, [[H8451]] but they [[H1992]] were arrogant [[H2102]] and disobeyed [[H8085]] Your commandments. [[H4687]] They sinned [[H2398]] against  Your ordinances, [[H4941]] by which a man [[H120]] will live [[H2421]] if he practices [[H6213]] them. [[H834]] They stubbornly [[H5637]] shrugged [[H5414]] their shoulders; [[H3802]] they stiffened [[H7185]] their necks [[H6203]] and would not [[H3808]] obey. [[H8085]] 
30 Yet You were patient [[H4900]] with [[H5921]] them for many [[H7227]] years, [[H8141]] and Your Spirit [[H7307]] admonished [[H5749]] them  through [[H3027]] Your prophets, [[H5030]] but they would not [[H3808]] listen; [[H238]] so You gave them [[H5414]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]] 
31 But in Your great [[H7227]] compassion, [[H7356]] You did not [[H3808]] put an end to them; [[H6213]] nor [[H3808]] did You forsake them, [[H5800]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are a gracious [[H2587]] and compassionate [[H7349]] God. [[H410]] 
32 So now, [[H6258]] our God, [[H430]] the great [[H1419]] and mighty [[H1368]] and awesome [[H3372]] God [[H410]] who keeps [[H8104]] His gracious [[H2617]] covenant, [[H1285]] do not [[H408]] view lightly [[H4591]] all [[H3605]] the hardships [[H8513]] that [[H834]] has come upon us, [[H4672]] and upon our kings [[H4428]] and leaders, [[H8269]] our priests [[H3548]] and prophets, [[H5030]] our ancestors [[H1]] and all [[H3605]] Your people, [[H5971]] from the days [[H3117]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] until today. [[H5704]] 
33 You [[H859]] are just [[H6662]] in [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that has befallen [[H935]] us, [[H5921]] because [[H3588]] You have acted [[H6213]] faithfully, [[H571]] while we [[H587]] have acted wickedly. [[H7561]] 
34 Our kings [[H4428]] and leaders [[H8269]] and priests [[H3548]] and fathers [[H1]] did not [[H3808]] obey [[H6213]] Your law [[H8451]] or listen [[H7181]] to [[H413]] Your commandments [[H4687]] and warnings [[H5715]] that [[H834]] You gave [[H5749]] them.  
35 For even while [[H1992]] they were in their kingdom, [[H4438]] with the abundant [[H7227]] goodness [[H2898]] You had given [[H5414]] them,  and in the spacious [[H7342]] and fertile [[H8082]] land [[H776]] You set [[H5414]] before them, [[H6440]] they would not [[H3808]] serve You [[H5647]] or turn [[H7725]] from their wicked [[H7451]] ways. [[H4611]] 
36 So here [[H2009]] we [are] [[H587]] today, [[H3117]] slaves [[H5650]] in the land [[H776]] You gave [[H5414]] our fathers [[H1]] to enjoy [[H398]] its fruit [[H6529]] and its goodness. [[H2898]] And here [[H2009]] we [are] [[H587]] as slaves! [[H5650]] 
37 Its abundant [[H7235]] harvest [[H8393]] goes to the kings [[H4428]] You have set [[H5414]] over us [[H5921]] because of our sins. [[H2403]] And they rule [[H4910]] over [[H5921]] our bodies [[H1472]] and our livestock [[H929]] as they please. [[H7522]] We [[H587]] are in great [[H1419]] distress.’ [[H6869]] 
38 In view of all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] we [[H587]] make [[H3772]] a binding agreement, [[H548]] putting it in writing [[H3789]] and [[H5921]] sealing it with [the names of] [[H2856]] our leaders, [[H8269]] Levites, [[H3881]] and priests.” [[H3548]]
