1 Gather yourselves, [[H7197]] gather together, [[H7197]] O shameful [[H3808]] nation, [[H1471]] 
2 before [[H2962]] the decree [[H2706]] takes effect [[H3205]] and the day [[H3117]] passes [[H5674]] like chaff, [[H4671]] before [[H2962]] the burning [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] comes [[H935]] upon you, [[H5921]] before [[H2962]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] comes [[H935]] upon you. [[H5921]] 
3 Seek [[H1245]] the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] you humble [[H6035]] of the earth, [[H776]] who [[H834]] carry out [[H6466]] His justice. [[H4941]] Seek [[H1245]] righteousness; [[H6664]] seek [[H1245]] humility. [[H6038]] Perhaps [[H194]] you will be sheltered [[H5641]] on the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger. [[H639]] 
4 For [[H3588]] Gaza [[H5804]] will be [[H1961]] abandoned, [[H5800]] and Ashkelon [[H831]] left in ruins. [[H8077]] Ashdod [[H795]] will be driven out [[H1644]] at noon, [[H6672]] and Ekron [[H6138]] will be uprooted. [[H6131]] 
5 Woe [[H1945]] to the inhabitants [[H3427]] of [[H2256]] the seacoast, [[H3220]] O nation [[H1471]] of the Cherethites! [[H3774]] The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is against you, [[H5921]] O Canaan, [[H3667]] land [[H776]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] ‘I will destroy you, [[H6]] and no one will be [[H369]] left.’ [[H3427]] 
6 So the seacoast [[H2256]] will become [[H1961]] [a land of] pastures, [[H5116]] having caves [[H3741]] filled with shepherds [[H7462]] and folds [[H1448]] with sheep. [[H6629]] 
7 The coast will belong [[H2256]] to [[H1961]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the house [[H1004]] of Judah; [[H3063]] there [[H5921]] they will find pasture. [[H7462]] They will lie down [[H7257]] in the evening [[H6153]] among the houses [[H1004]] of Ashkelon, [[H831]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] will attend to them [[H6485]] and restore [[H7725]] their captives. [[H7622]] 
8 I have heard [[H8085]] the reproach [[H2781]] of Moab [[H4124]] and the insults [[H1421]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] who [[H834]] have taunted [[H2778]] My people [[H5971]] and threatened [[H1431]] their borders. [[H1366]] 
9 Therefore, [[H3651]] as surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] surely [[H3588]] Moab [[H4124]] will be [[H1961]] like Sodom [[H5467]] and the Ammonites [[H1121]] like Gomorrah— [[H6017]] a place [[H4476]] of weeds [[H2738]] and [[H953]] saltpits, [[H4417]] and a perpetual [[H5704]] wasteland. [[H8077]] The remnant [[H7611]] of My people [[H5971]] will plunder them; [[H962]] the remainder [[H3499]] of My nation [[H1471]] will dispossess them. [[H5157]] 
10 This [[H2063]] they shall have [[H1992]] in return for [[H8478]] their pride, [[H1347]] for [[H3588]] taunting [[H2778]] and mocking [[H1431]] the people [[H5971]] of the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
11 The LORD [[H3068]] will be terrifying [[H3372]] to them [[H5921]] when [[H3588]] He starves [[H7329]] all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of the earth. [[H776]] Then the nations [[H1471]] of every [[H3605]] shore [[H339]] will bow in worship [[H7812]] to Him,  each [[H376]] in their own place. [[H4725]] 
12 You too, [[H859]] O Cushites, [[H3569]] will [[H1571]] be slain [[H2491]] by My sword. [[H2719]] 
13 And He will stretch out [[H5186]] His hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the north [[H6828]] and destroy [[H6]] Assyria; [[H804]] He will make [[H7760]] Nineveh [[H5210]] a desolation, [[H8077]] as dry [[H6723]] as a desert. [[H4057]] 
14 Herds [[H5739]] will lie down [[H7257]] in her midst, [[H8432]] creatures [[H2416]] of every kind. [[H3605]] Both [[H1571]] the desert owl [[H6893]] and [[H1571]] screech owl [[H7090]] will roost [[H3885]] atop her [pillars]. [[H3730]] Their calls [[H6963]] will sound [[H7891]] from the window, [[H2474]] but desolation [[H2721]] will lie on the threshold, [[H5592]] for [[H3588]] He will expose [[H6168]] the beams of cedar. [[H731]] 
15 This [[H2063]] carefree [[H5947]] city [[H5892]] that dwells [[H3427]] securely, [[H983]] that thinks [[H559]] to herself: [[H3824]] ‘I [am it], [[H589]] and [there is] none [[H657]] besides me,’ [[H5750]] what [[H349]] a ruin [[H8047]] she has become, [[H1961]] a resting place [[H4769]] for beasts. [[H2416]] Everyone [[H3605]] who passes [[H5674]] by her [[H5921]] hisses [[H8319]] and shakes [[H5128]] his fist. [[H3027]]
