1 [This is] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Zephaniah [[H6846]] son [[H1121]] of Cushi, [[H3569]] the son [[H1121]] of Gedaliah, [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Amariah, [[H568]] the son [[H1121]] of Hezekiah, [[H2396]] in the days [[H3117]] of Josiah [[H2977]] son [[H1121]] of Amon [[H526]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] 
2 “I will utterly sweep away [[H622]] everything [[H3605]] from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth,” [[H127]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 “I will sweep away [[H622]] man [[H120]] and beast; [[H929]] I will sweep away [[H622]] the birds [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] and the fish [[H1709]] of the sea, [[H3220]] and the ruins [[H4384]] along with the wicked. [[H7563]] I will cut off [[H3772]] mankind [[H120]] from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth,” [[H127]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 “I will stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] who dwell [[H3427]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] I will cut off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] every remnant [[H7605]] of Baal, [[H1168]] the names [[H8034]] of the idolatrous [[H3649]] and [[H5973]] [pagan] priests— [[H3548]] 
5 those who bow [[H7812]] on [[H5921]] the rooftops [[H1406]] to worship the heavenly [[H8064]] host, [[H6635]] those who bow down [[H7812]] and swear [[H7650]] by the LORD [[H3068]] but also swear [[H7650]] by Molech, [[H4445]] 
6 and [[H853]] those who turn back [[H5472]] from [following] [[H310]] the LORD [[H3069]] and [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3069]] nor [[H3808]] inquire of Him.” [[H1875]] 
7 Be silent [[H2013]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] for [[H3588]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is near. [[H7138]] Indeed, [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has prepared [[H3559]] a sacrifice; [[H2077]] He has consecrated [[H6942]] His guests. [[H7121]] 
8 On the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] sacrifice [[H2077]] I will punish [[H6485]] the princes, [[H8269]] the king’s [[H4428]] sons, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] who are dressed [[H3847]] in foreign [[H5237]] apparel. [[H4403]] 
9 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will punish [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] who leap [[H1801]] over [[H5921]] the threshold, [[H4670]] who fill [[H4390]] the house [[H1004]] of their master [[H113]] with violence [[H2555]] and deceit. [[H4820]] 
10 “On that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “a cry [[H6963]] will go up [[H1961]] from [[H4480]] the Fish [[H1709]] Gate, [[H8179]] a wail [[H3215]] from the Second Quarter, [[H4932]] and a loud [[H1419]] crashing [[H7667]] from the hills. [[H1389]] 
11 Wail, [[H3213]] O dwellers [[H3427]] of the Hollow, [[H4389]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] your merchants [[H5971]] will be silenced; [[H1820]] all [[H3605]] who weigh out [[H5187]] silver [[H3701]] will be cut off. [[H3772]] 
12 And [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I will search [[H2664]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with lamps [[H5216]] and punish [[H6485]] the men [[H376]] settled [[H7087]] in [[H5921]] complacency, [[H8105]] who say [[H559]] to themselves, [[H3824]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] will do nothing, [[H3808]] either good [[H3190]] or ill.’ [[H7489]] 
13 Their wealth [[H2428]] will be [[H1961]] plundered [[H4933]] and their houses [[H1004]] laid waste. [[H8077]] They will build [[H1129]] houses [[H1004]] but not [[H3808]] inhabit [them], [[H3427]] and plant [[H5193]] vineyards [[H3754]] but never [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] their wine. [[H3196]] 
14 The great [[H1419]] Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is near— [[H7138]] near [[H7138]] and coming [[H4118]] quickly. [[H3966]] Listen, [[H6963]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD! [[H3068]] Then [[H8033]] the cry [[H6873]] of the mighty [[H1368]] will be bitter. [[H4751]] 
15 That [[H1931]] day will be [[H3117]] a day [[H3117]] of wrath, [[H5678]] a day [[H3117]] of trouble [[H6869]] and distress, [[H4691]] a day [[H3117]] of destruction [[H7722]] and desolation, [[H4875]] a day [[H3117]] of darkness [[H2822]] and gloom, [[H653]] a day [[H3117]] of clouds [[H6051]] and blackness, [[H6205]] 
16 a day [[H3117]] of trumpet blast [[H7782]] and battle cry [[H8643]] against [[H5921]] the fortified [[H1219]] cities, [[H5892]] and against [[H5921]] the high [[H1364]] corner towers. [[H6438]] 
17 I will bring such distress [[H6887]] on mankind [[H120]] that they will walk [[H1980]] like the blind, [[H5787]] because [[H3588]] they have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD. [[H3068]] Their blood [[H1818]] will be poured out [[H8210]] like dust [[H6083]] and their flesh [[H3894]] like dung. [[H1561]] 
18 [Neither] their silver [[H3701]] nor [[H1571]] their gold [[H2091]] will be able [[H3201]] to deliver them [[H5337]] on the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] wrath. [[H5678]] The whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] will be consumed [[H398]] by the fire [[H784]] of His jealousy.” [[H7068]] For [[H3588]] indeed, [[H389]] He will make [[H6213]] a sudden [[H926]] end [[H3617]] of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the earth.
