# Jude 1
[[3 John 1|←]] • [[Revelation 1|→]]
1 Jude, [[G2455]] a servant [[G1401]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G1161]] a brother [[G80]] of James, [[G2385]] To those who [are] [[G3588]] called, [[G2822]] loved [[G25]] by [[G1722]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] kept [[G5083]] in Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]] 
2 Mercy, [[G1656]] peace, [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] love [[G26]] be multiplied [[G4129]] to you. [[G4771]] 
3 Beloved, [[G27]] [although] I made [[G4160]] every [[G3956]] effort [[G4710]] to write [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] salvation [[G4991]] we [[G1473]] share, [[G2839]] I felt [[G2192]] it necessary [[G318]] to write [[G1125]] [and] urge [[G3870]] you [[G4771]] to contend earnestly [[G1864]] for the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] entrusted [[G3860]] once for all [[G530]] to the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]] 
4 For [[G1063]] certain [[G5100]] men [[G444]] have crept in [among you] unnoticed— [[G3921]] ungodly [ones] [[G765]] who were designated [[G4270]] long ago [[G3819]] for [[G1519]] condemnation. [[G2917]] They turn [[G3346]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] into [[G1519]] a license for immorality, [[G766]] and [[G2532]] they deny [[G720]] our [[G1473]] only [[G3441]] Master [[G1203]] and [[G2532]] Lord, [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
5 Although you are fully aware of this, [[G1492]] I want [[G1014]] to remind [[G5279]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] after [[G1208]] Jesus [[G2424]] had delivered [[G4982]] [His] people [[G2992]] out of [[G1537]] [the] land [[G1093]] of Egypt, [[G125]] He destroyed [[G622]] those who [[G3588]] did not believe. [[G4100]] 
6 And [[G5037]] [the] angels [[G32]] who [[G3588]] did not stay within [[G5083]] their [[G1438]] [own] [[G3588]] domain, [[G746]] but [[G235]] abandoned [[G620]] their [[G3588]] [proper] [[G2398]] dwelling, [[G3613]] He keeps [[G5083]] under [[G5259]] darkness, [[G2217]] in eternal [[G126]] chains [[G1199]] for [[G1519]] judgment [[G2920]] on [that] great [[G3173]] day. [[G2250]] 
7 In like [[G3664]] manner, [[G5158]] Sodom [[G4670]] and [[G2532]] Gomorrah [[G1116]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cities [[G4172]] around [[G4012]] them, [[G846]] who indulged in sexual immorality [[G1608]] and [[G2532]] pursued [[G565]] strange [[G2087]] flesh, [[G4561]] are on display [[G4295]] as an example [[G1164]] of those who sustain [[G5254]] [the] punishment [[G1349]] of eternal [[G166]] fire. [[G4442]] 
8 Yet [[G3305]] in the same way, [[G3668]] these [[G3778]] dreamers [[G1797]] defile [[G3392]] [their] bodies, [[G4561]] reject [[G114]] authority, [[G2963]] and [[G1161]] slander [[G987]] glorious [beings]. [[G1391]] 
9 But [even] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] archangel [[G743]] Michael, [[G3413]] when [[G3753]] he disputed [[G1252]] with the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] over [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Moses, [[G3475]] did not presume [[G5111]] to bring [[G2018]] a slanderous [[G988]] judgment {against him}, [[G2920]] but [[G235]] said, [[G2036]] “[The] Lord [[G2962]] rebuke [[G2008]] you! [[G4771]] 
10 These [men], [[G3778]] however, [[G1161]] slander [[G987]] what [[G3745]] they do not understand, [[G1492]] and [[G1161]] like [[G5613]] irrational [[G249]] animals, [[G2226]] they will be destroyed [[G5351]] by [[G1722]] the things [[G3778]] they do instinctively. [[G1987]] 
11 Woe [[G3759]] to them! [[G846]] They have traveled [[G4198]] the [[G3588]] path [[G3598]] of Cain; [[G2535]] they have rushed [[G1632]] headlong [[G3408]] into the [[G3588]] error [[G4106]] of Balaam; [[G903]] they have perished [[G622]] in [[G3588]] Korah’s [[G2879]] rebellion. [[G485]] 
12 These [men] [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] hidden reefs [[G4694]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] love feasts, [[G26]] shamelessly [[G870]] feasting [with you] [[G4910]] [but] shepherding [[G4165]] [only] themselves. [[G1438]] [They are] clouds [[G3507]] without water, [[G504]] carried along [[G3911]] by [[G5259]] [the] wind; [[G417]] fruitless [[G175]] trees [[G1186]] in autumn, [[G5352]] twice [[G1364]] dead [[G599]] after being uprooted. [[G1610]] 
13 [They are] wild [[G66]] waves [[G2949]] of [the] sea, [[G2281]] foaming up [[G1890]] their [[G1438]] [own] [[G3588]] shame; [[G152]] wandering [[G4107]] stars, [[G792]] for whom [[G3739]] blackest [[G2217]] darkness [[G4655]] has been reserved [[G5083]] forever. [[G165]] 
14 Enoch, [[G1802]] [the] seventh [[G1442]] from [[G575]] Adam, [[G76]] also [[G2532]] prophesied [[G4395]] about them: [[G3778]] “Behold, [[G2400]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] is coming [[G2064]] with [[G1722]] myriads [[G3461]] of His [[G846]] holy [ones] [[G40]] 
15 to execute [[G4160]] judgment [[G2920]] on [[G2596]] everyone, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] to convict [[G1651]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] ungodly [[G765]] of [[G4012]] every [[G3956]] ungodly [[G764]] act [[G2041]] of wickedness [[G763]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] harsh [word] [[G4642]] spoken [[G2980]] against [[G2596]] Him [[G846]] by ungodly [[G765]] sinners. [[G268]] 
16 These [men] [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] discontented [[G3202]] grumblers, [[G1113]] following [[G4198]] after [[G2596]] [their] [[G3588]] own [[G846]] lusts; [[G1939]] their [[G846]] mouths [[G4750]] spew [[G2980]] arrogance; [[G5246]] they flatter [[G2296]] others [[G4383]] for their own [[G5484]] advantage. [[G5622]] 
17 But [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] beloved, [[G27]] remember [[G3403]] what [[G3588]] was foretold [[G4302]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] 
18 when [[G3754]] they said [[G2036]] to you, [[G4771]] “In [[G1909]] [the] last [[G2078]] times [[G5550]] there will be [[G1510]] scoffers [[G1703]] who will follow [[G4198]] after [[G2596]] their own [[G1438]] ungodly [[G763]] desires.” [[G1939]] 
19 These [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] the [ones who] [[G3588]] cause divisions, [[G592]] [who are] worldly [[G5591]] [and] devoid of [[G2192]] [the] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
20 But [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] beloved, [[G27]] by building [[G2026]] yourselves {up} [[G1438]] in [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] most holy [[G40]] faith [[G4102]] [and] praying [[G4336]] in [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] 
21 keep [[G5083]] yourselves [[G1438]] in [[G1722]] [the] love [[G26]] of God [[G2316]] as you await [[G4327]] the [[G3588]] mercy [[G1656]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] to bring [you] [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]] 
22 And [[G2532]] indeed, [[G3303]] have mercy on [[G1653]] those who [[G3739]] doubt; [[G1252]] 
23 save [[G4982]] others [[G3739]] by snatching [them] [[G726]] from [[G1537]] [the] fire; [[G4442]] and [[G1161]] to still others, [[G3739]] show mercy [[G1653]] [ tempered ] with [[G1722]] fear, [[G5401]] hating [[G3404]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] clothing [[G5509]] stained [[G4695]] by [[G575]] the [[G3588]] flesh. [[G4561]] 
24 Now [[G1161]] to Him who [[G3588]] is able [[G1410]] to keep [[G5442]] you [[G4771]] from stumbling [[G679]] and [[G2532]] to present [you] [[G2476]] unblemished [[G299]] in His [[G846]] glorious [[G1391]] presence, [[G2714]] with [[G1722]] great joy— [[G20]] 
25 to [the] only [[G3441]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Savior [[G4990]] [be] glory, [[G1391]] majesty, [[G3172]] dominion, [[G2904]] and [[G2532]] authority, [[G1849]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G1473]] Lord, [[G2962]] before [[G4253]] all [[G3956]] time, [[G165]] and [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] eternity. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]
