# 2 Samuel 3
[[2 Samuel 2|←]] • [[2 Samuel 4|→]]
1 The war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] and the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] was [[H1961]] protracted. [[H752]] And David [[H1732]] grew [stronger] [[H1980]] and stronger, [[H2390]] while the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] grew [weaker] [[H1980]] and weaker. [[H1800]] 
2 And sons [[H1121]] were born [[H3205]] to David [[H1732]] in Hebron: [[H2275]] His firstborn [[H1060]] was [[H1961]] Amnon, [[H550]] by Ahinoam [[H293]] of Jezreel; [[H3159]] 
3 his second [[H4932]] was Chileab, [[H3609]] by Abigail, [[H26]] the widow [[H802]] of Nabal [[H5037]] of Carmel; [[H3761]] his third [[H7992]] was Absalom, [[H53]] the son [[H1121]] of Maacah [[H4601]] the daughter [[H1323]] of King [[H4428]] Talmai [[H8526]] of Geshur; [[H1650]] 
4 his fourth [[H7243]] was Adonijah, [[H138]] the son [[H1121]] of Haggith; [[H2294]] his fifth [[H2549]] was Shephatiah, [[H8203]] the son [[H1121]] of Abital; [[H37]] 
5 and his sixth [[H8345]] was Ithream, [[H3507]] by David’s [[H1732]] wife [[H802]] Eglah. [[H5698]] These [sons] [[H428]] were born [[H3205]] to David [[H1732]] in Hebron. [[H2275]] 
6 Now during [[H1961]] the war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] and the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] Abner [[H74]] had continued to strengthen [his position] [[H2388]] in the house [[H1004]] of Saul. [[H7586]] 
7 Meanwhile, Saul [[H7586]] had a concubine [[H6370]] named [[H8034]] Rizpah, [[H7532]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Aiah. [[H345]] So Ish-bosheth questioned [[H559]] Abner, [[H74]] “Why [[H4069]] did you sleep with [[H935]] my father’s [[H1]] concubine?” [[H6370]] 
8 Abner [[H74]] was furious [[H2734]] over [[H5921]] Ish-bosheth’s [[H378]] accusation. [[H1697]] “Am I [[H595]] the head [[H7218]] of a dog [[H3611]] that [[H834]] belongs to Judah?” [[H3063]] he asked. [[H559]] “All this time [[H3117]] I have been loyal [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of your father [[H1]] Saul, [[H7586]] to [[H413]] his brothers, [[H251]] and to [[H413]] his friends. [[H4828]] I have not [[H3808]] delivered you [[H4672]] into the hand [[H3027]] of David, [[H1732]] but now [[H3117]] you accuse [[H6485]] me [[H5921]] of wrongdoing [[H5771]] with this woman! [[H802]] 
9 May God [[H430]] punish [[H3541]] Abner, [[H74]] and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if [[H3588]] I do not do [[H6213]] for David [[H1732]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has sworn to him, [[H7650]] 
10 to transfer [[H5674]] the kingdom [[H4467]] from the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] and to establish [[H6965]] the throne [[H3678]] of David [[H1732]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] from Dan [[H1835]] to [[H5704]] Beersheba.” [[H884]] 
11 And for fear [[H3372]] [of Abner], [[H853]] Ish-bosheth did not dare [[H3201]] to say [[H7725]] another word [[H1697]] to [him]. [[H74]] 
12 Then Abner [[H74]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] in his place [[H8478]] to say [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “To whom [does] [[H4310]] the land [belong]? [[H776]] Make [[H3772]] your covenant [[H1285]] with me, [[H854]] and you can be certain [[H2009]] my hand [will be] [[H3027]] on your side [[H5973]] to turn [[H5437]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] to you.” [[H413]] 
13 “Good,” [[H2896]] replied David, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] will make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with you. [[H854]] But [[H389]] there is one [[H259]] thing [[H1697]] I [[H595]] require [[H7592]] of you: [[H854]] Do not [[H3808]] appear [[H7200]] before me [[H6440]] unless [[H518]] you bring [[H935]] Saul’s [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] Michal [[H4324]] when you come [[H935]] to see me.” [[H7200]] 
14 Then David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to say [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ish-bosheth [[H378]] son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] “Give [[H5414]] me back my wife, [[H802]] Michal, [[H4324]] whom [[H834]] I betrothed [[H781]] to myself  for a hundred [[H3967]] Philistine [[H6430]] foreskins.” [[H6190]] 
15 So Ish-bosheth [[H378]] sent [[H7971]] and took [Michal] [[H3947]] from [[H5973]] [her] husband [[H376]] Paltiel [[H6409]] son [[H1121]] of Laish. [[H3919]] 
16 Her husband [[H376]] followed [[H1980]] her, [[H310]] weeping [[H1058]] all the way to [[H5704]] Bahurim. [[H980]] Then Abner [[H74]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Go back.” [[H7725]] So he returned [home]. [[H7725]] 
17 Now Abner [[H74]] conferred [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] and said, [[H559]] “In the past [[H8543]] you sought [[H1245]] David [[H1732]] as your king. [[H4428]] 
18 Now [[H6258]] take action, [[H6213]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] ‘Through [[H3027]] My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] I will save [[H3467]] My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] from the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] [and] [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] their enemies.’” [[H341]] 
19 Abner [[H74]] also [[H1571]] spoke to [[H1696]] the Benjamites [[H1144]] and went [[H1980]] to Hebron [[H2275]] to tell [[H1696]] David [[H1732]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] seemed good [[H2896]] to Israel [[H3478]] and the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]] 
20 When Abner [[H74]] and twenty [[H6242]] of his men [[H376]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] at Hebron, [[H2275]] David [[H1732]] held [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] for them. [[H74]] 
21 Then Abner [[H74]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “Let me go at once, [[H1980]] and I will gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] to [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] that they may make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with you, [[H854]] and that you may rule [[H4427]] over all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] your heart [[H5315]] desires.” [[H183]] So David [[H1732]] dismissed [[H7971]] Abner, [[H74]] and he went [[H1980]] in peace. [[H7965]] 
22 Just then [[H2009]] David’s [[H1732]] soldiers [[H5650]] and Joab [[H3097]] returned [[H935]] from a raid, [[H1416]] bringing [[H935]] with them [[H5973]] a great [[H7227]] plunder. [[H7998]] But Abner [was] [[H74]] not [[H369]] with [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] in Hebron [[H2275]] because [[H3588]] David had sent him [[H7971]] on his way [[H1980]] in peace. [[H7965]] 
23 When Joab [[H3097]] and all [[H3605]] his troops [[H6635]] arrived, [[H935]] [he] [[H3097]] was informed, [[H5046]] “Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner [[H5369]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] see the king, [[H4428]] who sent him [[H7971]] on his way [[H1980]] in peace.” [[H7965]] 
24 So Joab [[H3097]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] have you done? [[H6213]] Look, [[H2009]] Abner [[H74]] came [[H935]] to you. [[H413]] Why [[H4100]] did you dismiss him? [[H7971]] Now he is getting away. [[H1980]] 
25 Surely you realize [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner [[H5369]] came [[H935]] to deceive you [[H6601]] and to track [[H3045]] your movements [[H4161]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] you are [[H859]] doing.” [[H6213]] 
26 As soon as Joab [[H3097]] had left [[H3318]] David, [[H1732]] he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] after [[H310]] Abner, [[H74]] who brought him back [[H7725]] from the well [[H953]] of Sirah; [[H5626]] but David [[H1732]] was unaware [[H3808]] of it. [[H3045]] 
27 When Abner [[H74]] returned [[H7725]] to Hebron, [[H2275]] Joab [[H3097]] pulled him aside [[H5186]] into [[H413]] the gateway, [[H8179]] as if to speak [[H1696]] to him privately, [[H854]] and there [[H8033]] Joab stabbed [[H5221]] him in the stomach. [[H2570]] So Abner died [[H4191]] on account of the blood [[H1818]] of  Joab’s brother [[H251]] Asahel. [[H6214]] 
28 Afterward, [[H3651]] David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]] about this [[H310]] and said, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] and my kingdom [[H4467]] are forever [[H5769]] guiltless [[H5355]] before [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] concerning the blood [[H1818]] of Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner. [[H5369]] 
29 May it whirl [[H2342]] over [[H5921]] the heads [[H7218]] of Joab [[H3097]] and [[H413]] the entire [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of his father, [[H1]] and may the house [[H1004]] of Joab [[H3097]] never [[H408]] be without [[H3772]] one having a discharge [[H2100]] or skin disease [[H6879]] or who leans [[H2388]] on a staff [[H6418]] or falls [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] or starves.” [[H2638]] 
30 (Joab [[H3097]] and his brother [[H251]] Abishai [[H52]] murdered [[H2026]] Abner [[H74]] because [[H5921]] he had killed [[H4191]] their brother [[H251]] Asahel [[H6214]] in the battle [[H4421]] at Gibeon.) [[H1391]] 
31 Then David [[H1732]] ordered [[H559]] Joab [[H3097]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] with him, [[H854]] “Tear [[H7167]] your clothes, [[H899]] put on [[H2296]] sackcloth, [[H8242]] and mourn [[H5594]] before [[H6440]] Abner.” [[H74]] And King [[H4428]] David himself [[H1732]] walked [[H1980]] behind [[H310]] the funeral bier. [[H4296]] 
32 When they buried [[H6912]] Abner [[H74]] in Hebron, [[H2275]] the king [[H4428]] wept [[H1058]] aloud [[H5375]] at [[H413]] Abner’s [[H74]] tomb, [[H6913]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] wept. [[H1058]] 
33 And the king [[H4428]] sang this lament [[H6969]] for [[H413]] Abner: [[H74]] “Should Abner [[H74]] die [[H4191]] the death [[H4194]] of a fool? [[H5036]] 
34 Your hands [[H3027]] were not [[H3808]] bound, [[H631]] your feet [[H7272]] were not [[H3808]] fettered. [[H5178]] As a man falls [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the wicked, [[H5766]] [so also] you fell.” [[H5307]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] wept [[H1058]] over him [[H5921]] even more. [[H3254]] 
35 Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] and urged David [[H1732]] to eat [[H1262]] something [[H3899]] while it was still [[H5750]] day, [[H3117]] but David [[H1732]] took an oath, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] “May God [[H430]] punish [[H3541]] me,  and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if [[H518]] I taste [[H2938]] bread [[H3899]] or [[H176]] anything [[H3605]] else before [[H6440]] the sun [[H8121]] sets! [[H935]] 
36 All [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] took note [[H5234]] and [[H3190]] were pleased. [[H5869]] In fact, everything [[H3605]] the king [[H4428]] did [[H6213]] pleased [[H5869]] them. [[H3605]] 
37 So on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] the troops [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] were convinced [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] had no [[H3808]] part [[H1961]] in the murder [[H4191]] of Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner. [[H5369]] 
38 Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Do you not [[H3808]] realize [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] a great [[H1419]] prince [[H8269]] has fallen [[H5307]] today [[H3117]] in Israel? [[H3478]] 
39 And I [am] [[H595]] weak [[H7390]] this day, [[H3117]] though anointed [[H4886]] as king, [[H4428]] and these [[H428]] men, [[H376]] the sons [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] are too fierce [[H7186]] for me. [[H4480]] May the LORD [[H3068]] repay [[H7999]] the evildoer [[H6213]] according to his evil!” [[H7451]]
