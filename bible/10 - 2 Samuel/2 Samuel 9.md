[[2 Samuel 8|←]] • [[2 Samuel 10|→]]
1 Then David [[H1732]] asked, [[H559]] “Is there [[H3426]] anyone left [[H3498]] from the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] to whom [[H5973]] I can show [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] for the sake [[H5668]] of Jonathan?” [[H3083]] 
2 And there was a servant [[H5650]] of Saul’s [[H7586]] family [[H1004]] named [[H8034]] Ziba. [[H6717]] They summoned [[H7121]] him  to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and the king [[H4428]] inquired, [[H559]] “Are you [[H859]] Ziba?” [[H6717]] “I am your servant,” [[H5650]] he replied. [[H559]] 
3 So the king [[H4428]] asked, [[H559]] “Is there anyone [[H376]] left of Saul’s [[H7586]] family [[H1004]] to whom [[H5973]] I can show [[H6213]] the kindness [[H2617]] of God?” [[H430]] Ziba [[H6717]] answered, [[H559]] “There is [[H5750]] still [[H5750]] Jonathan’s [[H3083]] son, [[H1121]] [who is] lame [[H5223]] in both feet.” [[H7272]] 
4 “Where [[H375]] is he?” [[H1931]] replied [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]] And Ziba [[H6717]] said, [[H559]] “Indeed, [[H2009]] he [is] [[H1931]] in Lo-debar [[H3810]] at the house [[H1004]] of Machir [[H4353]] son [[H1121]] of Ammiel.” [[H5988]] 
5 So King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] had him brought [[H3947]] from the house [[H1004]] of Machir [[H4353]] son [[H1121]] of Ammiel [[H5988]] in Lo-debar. [[H3810]] 
6 And when Mephibosheth [[H4648]] son [[H1121]] of Jonathan, [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] he fell facedown [[H5307]] in reverence. [[H7812]] Then David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “Mephibosheth!” [[H4648]] “I am your servant,” [[H5650]] he replied. [[H559]] 
7 “Do not [[H408]] be afraid,” [[H3372]] said [[H559]] David, [[H1732]] “for [[H3588]] surely [[H6213]] I will show [[H6213]] you [[H5973]] kindness [[H2617]] for the sake [[H5668]] of your father [[H1]] Jonathan. [[H3083]] I will restore [[H7725]] to you  all [[H3605]] the land [[H7704]] of your grandfather [[H1]] Saul, [[H7586]] and you [[H859]] will always [[H8548]] eat [[H398]] at [[H5921]] my table.” [[H7979]] 
8 Mephibosheth bowed down [[H7812]] and said, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] is your servant, [[H5650]] that [[H3588]] you should show regard [[H6437]] for [[H413]] a dead [[H4191]] dog [[H3611]] like me?” [[H3644]] 
9 Then the king [[H4428]] summoned [[H7121]] Saul’s [[H7586]] servant [[H5288]] Ziba [[H6717]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “I have given [[H5414]] to your master’s [[H113]] grandson [[H1121]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] belonged to [[H1961]] Saul [[H7586]] and to all [[H3605]] his house. [[H1004]] 
10 You [[H859]] and your sons [[H1121]] and servants [[H5650]] are to work [[H5647]] the ground for him [[H127]] and bring in [the harvest], [[H935]] so that your master’s [[H113]] grandson [[H1121]] may have [[H1961]] food [[H3899]] to eat. [[H398]] But Mephibosheth, [[H4648]] your master’s [[H113]] grandson, [[H1121]] is always [[H8548]] to eat [[H398]] at [[H5921]] my table.” [[H7979]] Now Ziba [[H6717]] had fifteen [[H2568]] sons [[H1121]] and twenty [[H6242]] servants. [[H5650]] 
11 And Ziba [[H6717]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “Your servant [[H5650]] will do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] has commanded.” [[H6680]] So Mephibosheth [[H4648]] ate [[H398]] at [[H5921]] David’s table [[H7979]] like one [[H259]] of the king’s [[H4428]] sons. [[H1121]] 
12 And Mephibosheth had [[H4648]] a young [[H6996]] son [[H1121]] named [[H8034]] Mica, [[H4316]] and all [[H3605]] who dwelt [[H4186]] in the house [[H1004]] of Ziba [[H6717]] [were] servants [[H5650]] of Mephibosheth. [[H4648]] 
13 So Mephibosheth [[H4648]] lived [[H3427]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] always [[H8548]] ate [[H398]] at [[H5921]] the king’s [[H4428]] table, [[H7979]] and he was lame [[H6455]] in both [[H8147]] feet. [[H7272]]
