1 Now Joab [[H3097]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] perceived [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the king’s [[H4428]] heart [[H3820]] longed for [[H5921]] Absalom. [[H53]] 
2 So Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] to Tekoa [[H8620]] to bring [[H3947]] a wise [[H2450]] woman [[H802]] from there. [[H8033]] He told her, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] pretend to be a mourner; [[H56]] put on [[H3847]] clothes [[H899]] for mourning [[H60]] and do not [[H408]] anoint yourself [[H5480]] with oil. [[H8081]] Act [[H1961]] like a woman [[H802]] who has mourned [[H56]] for [[H5921]] the dead [[H4191]] a long [[H7227]] time. [[H3117]] 
3 Then go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] and speak [[H1696]] these [[H2088]] words [[H1697]] to him.” [[H413]] And Joab [[H3097]] put [[H7760]] the words [[H1697]] in her mouth. [[H6310]] 
4 When the woman [[H802]] from Tekoa [[H8621]] went to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] she fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H639]] in homage [[H7812]] and said, [[H559]] “Help me, [[H3467]] O king!” [[H4428]] 
5 “What [[H4100]] troubles you?”  the king [[H4428]] asked [[H559]] her.  “Indeed,” [[H61]] she said, [[H559]] “I [am] [[H589]] a widow, [[H490]] for my husband [[H376]] is dead. [[H4191]] 
6 And your maidservant [[H8198]] had two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] [who] [[H8147]] were fighting [[H5327]] in the field [[H7704]] with no [[H369]] one to separate [[H5337]] them, [[H996]] and one [[H259]] struck [[H5221]] the other [[H259]] and killed [[H4191]] him. [[H853]] 
7 Now [[H2009]] the whole [[H3605]] clan [[H4940]] has risen up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] your maidservant [[H8198]] and said, [[H559]] ‘Hand over [[H5414]] the one who struck down [[H5221]] his brother, [[H251]] that we may put him to death [[H4191]] for the life [[H5315]] of the brother [[H251]] whom [[H834]] he killed. [[H2026]] Then we will cut off [[H8045]] the heir [[H3423]] as well!’ [[H1571]] So they would extinguish [[H3518]] my one remaining [[H7604]] ember [[H1513]] by not [[H1115]] preserving [[H7760]] my husband’s [[H7760]] name [[H8034]] or posterity [[H7611]] on [[H5921]] the earth. [[H127]] 
8 “Go [[H1980]] home,” [[H1004]] the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to the woman, [[H802]] “and I [[H589]] will give orders [[H6680]] on your behalf.” [[H5921]] 
9 But the woman [[H802]] of Tekoa [[H8621]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “My lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] may any blame [[H5771]] be on [[H5921]] me and my father’s [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] and may the king [[H4428]] and his throne [[H3678]] [be] guiltless.” [[H5355]] 
10 “If anyone speaks [[H1696]] to you,” [[H413]] said [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] “bring [[H935]] him to me, [[H413]] and he will not [[H3808]] trouble [[H5060]] you again!” [[H3254]] 
11 “Please,” [[H4994]] she replied, [[H559]] “may the king [[H4428]] invoke [[H2142]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] to prevent the avenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] from increasing [[H7235]] the devastation, [[H7843]] so that my son [[H1121]] may not [[H3808]] be destroyed!” [[H8045]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives,” [[H2416]] he vowed, [[H559]] “not [[H518]] a hair [[H8185]] of your son's head [[H1121]] will fall [[H5307]] to the ground.” [[H776]] 
12 Then the woman [[H802]] said, [[H559]] “Please, [[H4994]] may your servant [[H8198]] speak [[H1696]] a word [[H1697]] to [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king?” [[H4428]] “Speak,” [[H1696]] he replied. [[H559]] 
13 The woman [[H802]] asked, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] have you devised [[H2803]] a thing like this [[H2063]] against [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] of God? [[H430]] When the king [[H4428]] says [[H1696]] this, [[H2088]] does he not convict himself, [[H818]] since [he] [[H4428]] has not [[H1115]] brought back [[H7725]] his own banished [son]? [[H5080]] 
14 For [[H3588]] surely [[H4191]] we will die [[H4191]] and be like water [[H4325]] poured out [[H5064]] on the ground, [[H776]] which [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] be recovered. [[H622]] Yet God [[H430]] does not [[H3808]] take away [[H5375]] a life; [[H5315]] but He devises [[H2803]] ways [[H4284]] so that the banished one [[H5080]] may not [[H1115]] remain estranged [[H5080]] from Him. [[H4480]] 
15 Now therefore, [[H6258]] I have come [[H935]] to present [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] matter [[H1697]] to [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] because [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] have made me afraid. [[H3372]] Your servant [[H8198]] thought: [[H559]] I will speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]] Perhaps [[H194]] [he] [[H4428]] will grant [[H6213]] the request [[H1697]] of his maidservant. [[H519]] 
16 For [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] will hear [[H8085]] and deliver [[H5337]] his maidservant [[H519]] from the hand [[H3709]] of the man [[H376]] [who would] cut off [[H8045]] both [[H3162]] me [[H853]] and [[H853]] my son [[H1121]] from God’s [[H430]] inheritance. [[H5159]] 
17 Your servant [[H8198]] thought: [[H559]] May the word [[H1697]] of my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] bring me rest, [[H4496]] for [[H3588]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] is able to discern [[H8085]] good [[H2896]] and evil, [[H7451]] just like the Angel [[H4397]] of God. [[H430]] May the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] be [[H1961]] with you.” [[H5973]] 
18 Then the king [[H4428]] said to [[H6030]] the woman, [[H802]] “I am [[H595]] going to ask [[H7592]] you something; [[H1697]] do not [[H408]] conceal [[H3582]] it from me!” [[H4480]] “Let my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] speak,” [[H1696]] she [[H802]] replied. [[H559]] 
19 So the king [[H4428]] asked, [[H559]] “Is the hand [[H3027]] of Joab [[H3097]] behind [[H854]] all [[H3605]] this?” [[H2063]] The woman [[H802]] answered, [[H6030]] “As surely as you [[H5315]] live, [[H2416]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] no one [[H518]] can turn [[H786]] to the right [[H3231]] or to the left [[H8041]] from anything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] says. [[H1696]] Yes, [[H3588]] your servant [[H5650]] Joab [[H3097]] is the one who [[H1931]] gave me orders; [[H6680]] he [[H1931]] told [[H7760]] your maidservant [[H8198]] exactly what to say. [[H1697]] 
20 Joab [[H3097]] your servant [[H5650]] has done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] to [[H5668]] bring about [[H5437]] this change [[H6440]] of affairs, [[H1697]] but my lord [[H113]] has wisdom [[H2450]] like the wisdom [[H2451]] of the Angel [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] to know [[H3045]] everything [[H3605]] that [happens] [[H834]] in the land.” [[H776]] 
21 Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] “I hereby grant [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] request. [[H1697]] Go, [[H1980]] bring back [[H7725]] the young man [[H5288]] Absalom.” [[H53]] 
22 Joab [[H3097]] fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H6440]] in homage [[H7812]] and blessed [[H1288]] the king. [[H4428]] “Today,” [[H3117]] said [[H559]] Joab, [[H3097]] “your servant [[H5650]] knows [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] he has found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] with you, [[H5869]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] because [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] has granted [[H6213]] his request.” [[H1697]] 
23 So Joab [[H3097]] got up, [[H6965]] went [[H1980]] to Geshur, [[H1650]] and brought [[H935]] Absalom [[H53]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
24 But the king [[H4428]] added, [[H559]] “He may return [[H5437]] to [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] but he must not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my face.” [[H6440]] So Absalom [[H53]] returned [[H5437]] to [[H413]] his own house, [[H1004]] but he did not [[H3808]] see the king. [[H7200]] 
25 Now there was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] in all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] as handsome [[H3303]] and highly [[H3966]] praised [[H1984]] as Absalom. [[H53]] From the sole [[H3709]] of his foot [[H7272]] to [[H5704]] the top of his head, [[H6936]] he did not [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] a single flaw. [[H3971]] 
26 And when he cut the hair [[H1548]] of [[H853]] his head— [[H7218]] he shaved [[H1548]] it every year [[H7093]] because [[H3588]] his hair got so heavy— [[H3513]] he would weigh [[H8254]] [it] [[H8181]] [to be] two hundred [[H3967]] shekels [[H8255]] according to the royal [[H4428]] standard. [[H68]] 
27 Three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] were born [[H3205]] to Absalom, [[H53]] and a [[H259]] daughter [[H1323]] named [[H8034]] Tamar, [[H8559]] who [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] a beautiful [[H3303]] woman. [[H802]] 
28 Now Absalom [[H53]] lived [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] two [[H8141]] years [[H3117]] without [[H3808]] seeing [[H7200]] the face [[H6440]] of the king. [[H4428]] 
29 Then [he] [[H53]] sent [[H7971]] for [[H413]] Joab [[H3097]] to send [[H7971]] him to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] but Joab refused [[H3808]] to come. [[H935]] So [Absalom] sent [[H7971]] the second [time], [[H8145]] but [Joab] still would not [[H3808]] come. [[H935]] 
30 So Absalom said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Look, [[H7200]] Joab's [[H3097]] field is [[H2513]] next to [[H413]] mine, [[H3027]] and he has  barley [[H8184]] there. [[H8033]] Go [[H1980]] and set fire [[H3341]] to it!” [[H784]] And Absalom's [[H53]] servants [[H5650]] set the field [[H2513]] on fire. [[H3341]] 
31 Then Joab [[H3097]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Absalom’s [[H53]] house [[H1004]] and demanded, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] did your servants [[H5650]] set my field [[H2513]] on fire?” [[H3341]] 
32 “Look,” [[H2009]] said [[H559]] Absalom, [[H53]] “I sent [[H7971]] for [[H413]] you and said, [[H559]] ‘Come [[H935]] here. [[H2008]] I want to send [[H7971]] you to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] to ask: [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] have I come back [[H935]] from Geshur? [[H1650]] [It would be] better [[H2896]] for me  [if] I [were] [[H589]] still [[H5750]] there.’ [[H8033]] So now, [[H6258]] let me see [[H7200]] the king's [[H4428]] face, [[H6440]] and if [[H518]] there is [[H3426]] iniquity [[H5771]] in me,  let him kill me.” [[H4191]] 
33 So Joab [[H3097]] went [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] [the king],  and David summoned [[H7121]] Absalom, [[H53]] who came [[H935]] to [[H413]] [him] [[H4428]] and bowed [[H7812]] facedown [[H639]] before him. [[H6440]] Then the king [[H4428]] kissed [[H5401]] Absalom. [[H53]]
