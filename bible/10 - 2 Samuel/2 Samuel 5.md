# 2 Samuel 5
[[2 Samuel 4|←]] • [[2 Samuel 6|→]]
1 Then all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] at Hebron [[H2275]] and said, [[H559]] “Here [[H2005]] we [are], [[H587]] your own flesh [[H1320]] and blood. [[H6106]] 
2 Even [[H1571]] in times past, [[H8032]] while Saul [[H7586]] was [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over us, [[H5921]] you [[H859]] were the one [[H1961]] who led Israel out [[H3318]] and brought them back. [[H935]] And to you  the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] ‘You [[H859]] will shepherd [[H7462]] My people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and you [[H859]] will be [[H1961]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] [them]. [[H3478]] 
3 So all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] at Hebron, [[H2275]] [where] [[H2275]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] made [[H3772]] with them  a covenant [[H1285]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] And they anointed [[H4886]] [him] [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
4 David [[H1732]] was thirty [[H7970]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] [and] he reigned [[H4427]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]] 
5 In Hebron [[H2275]] he reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] and six [[H8337]] months, [[H2320]] and in Jerusalem [[H3389]] he reigned [[H4427]] thirty-three [[H7970]] years [[H8141]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah. [[H3063]] 
6 Now the king [[H4428]] and his men [[H376]] marched [[H1980]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] against [[H413]] the Jebusites [[H2983]] who inhabited [[H3427]] the land. [[H776]] The Jebusites said [[H559]] to David: [[H1732]] “You will never [[H3808]] get in [[H935]] here. [[H2008]] Even [[H3588]] the blind [[H5787]] and lame [[H6452]] can repel you.” [[H5493]] For they thought, [[H559]] “David [[H1732]] cannot [[H3808]] get in [[H935]] here.” [[H2008]] 
7 Nevertheless, David [[H1732]] captured [[H3920]] the fortress [[H4686]] of Zion [[H6726]] (that is, [[H1931]] the City [[H5892]] of David). [[H1732]] 
8 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] [he] [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “Whoever attacks [[H5221]] the Jebusites [[H2983]] must use the water shaft [[H6794]] to reach [[H5060]] the lame [[H6455]] and blind [[H5787]] who are despised [[H8130]] by David.” [[H1732]] That is why [[H5921]] it is said, [[H559]] “The blind [[H5787]] and the lame [[H6455]] will never [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] the palace.” [[H1004]] 
9 So David [[H1732]] took up residence [[H3427]] in the fortress [[H4686]] and called [[H7121]] it  the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] He [[H1732]] built it up [[H1129]] all the way around, [[H5439]] from [[H4480]] the supporting terraces [[H4407]] inward. [[H1004]] 
10 And David [[H1732]] became [[H1980]] greater [[H1980]] and greater, [[H1419]] for the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Hosts [[H6635]] was with him. [[H5973]] 
11 King [[H4428]] Hiram [[H2438]] of Tyre [[H6865]] sent [[H7971]] envoys [[H4397]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] along with cedar [[H730]] logs, [[H6086]] carpenters, [[H2796]] and stonemasons, [[H2796]] and they built [[H1129]] a palace [[H1004]] for David. [[H1732]] 
12 And David [[H1732]] realized [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had established [[H3559]] him as king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] and had exalted [[H5375]] his kingdom [[H4467]] for the sake of [[H5668]] His people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
13 After [[H310]] he had arrived [[H935]] from Hebron, [[H2275]] David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] more [[H5750]] concubines [[H6370]] and wives [[H802]] from Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and more [[H5750]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] were born [[H3205]] to him. [[H1732]] 
14 These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of the children born [[H3209]] to him  in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] Shammua, [[H8051]] Shobab, [[H7727]] Nathan, [[H5416]] Solomon, [[H8010]] 
15 Ibhar, [[H2984]] Elishua, [[H474]] Nepheg, [[H5298]] Japhia, [[H3309]] 
16 Elishama, [[H476]] Eliada, [[H450]] and Eliphelet. [[H467]] 
17 When the Philistines [[H6430]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] had been anointed [[H4886]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] they [[H6430]] all [[H3605]] went [[H5927]] in search of [[H1245]] [him]; [[H1732]] but [David] [[H1732]] learned [of this] [[H8085]] and went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the stronghold. [[H4686]] 
18 Now the Philistines [[H6430]] had come [[H935]] and spread out [[H5203]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]] 
19 So David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] “Should I go up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] the Philistines? [[H6430]] Will You deliver them [[H5414]] into my hand?” [[H3027]] “Go,” [[H5927]] replied [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “for [[H3588]] I will surely deliver [[H5414]] the Philistines [[H6430]] into your hand.” [[H3027]] 
20 So David [[H1732]] went [[H935]] to Baal-perazim, [[H1188]] where he defeated [the Philistines] [[H5221]] and said, [[H559]] “Like a bursting [[H6556]] flood, [[H4325]] the LORD [[H3068]] has burst out [[H6555]] against my enemies [[H341]] before me.” [[H6440]] So [[H5921]] he called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Baal-perazim. [[H1188]] 
21 There [[H8033]] the Philistines abandoned [[H5800]] their idols, [[H6091]] and David [[H1732]] and his men [[H582]] carried them away. [[H5375]] 
22 Once again [[H3254]] the Philistines [[H6430]] came up [[H5927]] and spread out [[H5203]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]] 
23 So David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] who answered, [[H559]] “Do not [[H3808]] march straight up, [[H5927]] but circle [[H5437]] around [[H413]] behind [[H310]] them and attack [[H935]] them  in front [[H4136]] of the balsam trees. [[H1057]] 
24 As soon as [[H1961]] you hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of marching [[H6807]] in the tops [[H7218]] of the balsam trees, [[H1057]] move quickly, [[H2782]] because [[H3588]] this will mean [[H227]] the LORD [[H3068]] has marched out [[H3318]] before you [[H6440]] to strike [[H5221]] the camp [[H4264]] of the Philistines.” [[H6430]] 
25 So David [[H1732]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded him, [[H6680]] and he struck down [[H5221]] the Philistines [[H6430]] all the way from Geba [[H1387]] to [[H5704]] Gezer. [[H1507]]
