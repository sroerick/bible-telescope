# 2 Samuel 6
[[2 Samuel 5|←]] • [[2 Samuel 7|→]]
1 David [[H1732]] again [[H5750]] assembled [[H3254]] [the] choice [men] [[H970]] of Israel, [[H3478]] thirty [[H7970]] thousand [[H505]] in all. [[H3605]] 
2 And he [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] his troops [[H5971]] set out [[H1980]] for Baale of Judah [[H1184]] to bring up [[H5927]] from there [[H8033]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] is called [[H7121]] by the Name, [[H8034]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] who is enthroned [[H3427]] between the cherubim [[H3742]] that are on it. [[H5921]] 
3 They set [[H7392]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] on [[H413]] a new [[H2319]] cart [[H5699]] and brought it [[H5375]] from the house [[H1004]] of Abinadab, [[H41]] which [[H834]] was on the hill. [[H1389]] Uzzah [[H5798]] and Ahio, [[H283]] the sons [[H1121]] of Abinadab, [[H41]] were guiding [[H5090]] the new [[H2319]] cart, [[H5699]] 
4 bringing [[H5375]] with it [[H5973]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] from the house [[H1004]] of Abinadab, [[H41]] which [was] [[H834]] on the hill. [[H1389]] And Ahio [[H283]] was walking [[H1980]] in front [[H6440]] of the ark. [[H727]] 
5 David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] were celebrating [[H7832]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] with all kinds [[H3605]] of wood [instruments], [[H6086]] harps, [[H3658]] stringed instruments, [[H5035]] tambourines, [[H8596]] sistrums, [[H4517]] and cymbals. [[H6767]] 
6 When they came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the threshing floor [[H1637]] of Nachon, [[H5225]] Uzzah [[H5798]] reached out [[H7971]] and took hold [[H270]] of  the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] because [[H3588]] the oxen [[H1241]] had stumbled. [[H8058]] 
7 And the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] burned [[H2734]] against Uzzah, [[H5798]] and God [[H430]] struck him [[H5221]] down [[H5921]] on the spot [[H8033]] for his irreverence, [[H7944]] and he died [[H4191]] there [[H8033]] beside [[H5973]] the ark [[H727]] of God. [[H430]] 
8 Then David [[H1732]] became angry [[H2734]] because [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] had burst forth [[H6555]] against Uzzah; [[H5798]] so he named [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Perez-uzzah, [[H6560]] as it is [called] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
9 That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] David [[H1732]] feared [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] and asked, [[H559]] “How [[H349]] can the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] ever come [[H935]] to me?” [[H413]] 
10 So he [[H1732]] was unwilling [[H14]] to move [[H5493]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H5921]] the City [[H5892]] of David; [[H1732]] instead, he took [[H1732]] it aside [[H5186]] to the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] the Gittite. [[H1663]] 
11 Thus the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] remained [[H3427]] in the house [[H1004]] of  Obed-edom [[H5654]] the Gittite [[H1663]] for three [[H7969]] months, [[H2320]] and the LORD [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] [him] [[H5654]] and all [[H3605]] his household. [[H1004]] 
12 Now it was reported [[H5046]] to King [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has blessed [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] belongs to him,  because of [[H5668]] the ark [[H727]] of God.” [[H430]] So David [[H1732]] went [[H1980]] and had the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] brought up [[H5927]] from the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] into the City [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] with rejoicing. [[H8057]] 
13 When [[H3588]] those carrying [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had advanced [[H6805]] six [[H8337]] paces, [[H6806]] he sacrificed [[H2076]] an ox [[H7794]] and a fattened calf. [[H4806]] 
14 And David, [[H1732]] wearing [[H2296]] a linen [[H906]] ephod, [[H646]] danced [[H3769]] with all [[H3605]] his might [[H5797]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] 
15 while he [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] brought up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] with shouts [[H8643]] and the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpets. [[H7782]] 
16 As the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was entering [[H935]] the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] Saul’s [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] Michal [[H4324]] looked down [[H8259]] from [[H1157]] a window [[H2474]] and saw [[H7200]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] leaping [[H6339]] and dancing [[H3769]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and she despised him [[H959]] in her heart. [[H3820]] 
17 So they brought [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and set [[H3322]] it [[H853]] in its place [[H4725]] inside [[H8432]] the tent [[H168]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had pitched [[H5186]] for it.  Then David [[H1732]] offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings [[H8002]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
18 When David [[H1732]] had finished [[H3615]] sacrificing [[H5927]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings, [[H8002]] he blessed [[H1288]] the people [[H5971]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
19 Then he distributed [[H2505]] to all [[H3605]] the multitude [[H1995]] of Israel, [[H3478]] both men [[H376]] and [[H5704]] women, [[H802]] a [[H259]] loaf [[H2471]] of bread, [[H3899]] a [[H259]] date cake, [[H829]] and a [[H259]] raisin cake. [[H809]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] departed, [[H1980]] each [[H376]] for his own home. [[H1004]] 
20 As soon as David [[H1732]] returned [[H7725]] home to bless [[H1288]] his own household, [[H1004]] Saul’s [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] Michal [[H4324]] came out [[H3318]] to meet him. [[H1732]] “How [[H4100]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] has distinguished himself [[H3513]] today!” [[H3117]] she said. [[H559]] “He [[H834]] has uncovered himself [[H1540]] today [[H3117]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the maidservants [[H519]] of his subjects, [[H5650]] like a [[H259]] vulgar person [[H7386]] would [do].” [[H1540]] 
21 But David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Michal, [[H4324]] “I was dancing before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] who [[H834]] chose [[H977]] me  over your father [[H1]] and all [[H3605]] his house [[H1004]] when He appointed [[H6680]] me [[H853]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] I will celebrate [[H7832]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] 
22 and I will humiliate [[H7043]] and humble [[H8217]] myself [[H5869]] even more [[H5750]] than this. [[H2063]] Yet I will be honored [[H3513]] by [[H5973]] the maidservants [[H519]] of whom [[H834]] you have spoken.” [[H559]] 
23 And Michal [[H4324]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Saul [[H7586]] had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] children [[H3206]] to [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of her death. [[H4194]]
