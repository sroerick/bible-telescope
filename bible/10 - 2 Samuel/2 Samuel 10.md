1 Some time later, [[H310]] the king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] died [[H4191]] and was succeeded by [[H4427]] his son [[H1121]] Hanun. [[H2586]] 
2 And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “I will show [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] Hanun [[H2586]] son [[H1121]] of Nahash, [[H5176]] just as [[H834]] his father [[H1]] showed [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to me.” [[H5978]] So David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] some of his servants [[H5650]] to console [Hanun] [[H5162]] concerning [[H413]] his father. [[H1]] But when they [[H5650]] arrived [[H935]] in the land [[H776]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] 
3 the princes [[H8269]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Hanun [[H2586]] their lord, [[H113]] “Just because [[H3588]] David has sent [[H7971]] you  comforters, [[H5162]] do you really believe [[H5869]] he is [[H1732]] showing respect [[H3513]] for your father? [[H1]] Has not [[H3808]] David [[H1732]] [instead] sent [[H7971]] his servants [[H5650]] to [[H5668]] explore [[H2713]] the city, [[H5892]] spy it out, [[H7270]] and overthrow it? [[H2015]] 
4 So Hanun [[H2586]] took [[H3947]] David’s [[H1732]] servants, [[H5650]] shaved off [[H1548]] half [[H2677]] of each man's beard, [[H2206]] cut [[H3772]] their garments [[H4063]] in half [[H2677]] at [[H5704]] the hips, [[H8357]] and sent them away. [[H7971]] 
5 When this was reported [[H5046]] to David, [[H1732]] he sent messengers [[H7971]] to meet [the men], [[H7125]] since [[H3588]] they were [[H1961]] deeply [[H3966]] humiliated. [[H3637]] The king [[H4428]] told them, [[H559]] “Stay [[H3427]] in Jericho [[H3405]] until [[H5704]] your beards [[H2206]] have grown back, [[H6779]] and [then] return.” [[H7725]] 
6 When the Ammonites [[H1121]] realized that [[H7200]] they had become a stench [[H887]] to David, [[H1732]] they [[H1121]] hired [[H7936]] twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] Aramean [[H758]] foot soldiers [[H7273]] from Beth-rehob [[H1050]] and [[H853]] Zoba, [[H6678]] as well as [[H853]] a thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] from the king [[H4428]] of Maacah [[H4601]] and twelve [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] from Tob. [[H2897]] 
7 On hearing of this, [[H8085]] [David] sent [[H7971]] Joab [[H3097]] and [[H853]] the entire [[H3605]] army [[H6635]] of mighty men. [[H1368]] 
8 The Ammonites [[H1121]] marched out [[H3318]] and arrayed themselves [[H6186]] for battle [[H4421]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to their city gate, [[H8179]] while the Arameans [[H758]] of Zobah [[H6678]] and Rehob [[H7340]] and the men [[H376]] of Tob [[H2897]] and Maacah [[H4601]] were by themselves [[H905]] in the open country. [[H7704]] 
9 When Joab [[H3097]] saw [[H7200]] the battle lines [[H4421]] before him [[H6440]] and behind him, [[H268]] he selected [[H977]] some of [[H3605]] the best [[H970]] men of Israel [[H3478]] and arrayed them [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the Arameans. [[H758]] 
10 And [[H853]] he placed [[H5414]] the rest [[H3499]] of the forces [[H5971]] under the command [[H3027]] of his brother [[H251]] Abishai, [[H52]] who arrayed them [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the Ammonites. [[H1121]] 
11 “If [[H518]] the Arameans [[H758]] are too strong [[H2388]] for me,” [[H4480]] said Joab, [[H559]] “then you will come [[H1961]] to my rescue. [[H3467]] And if [[H518]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] are too strong [[H2388]] for you, [[H4480]] then I will come [[H1980]] to your rescue. [[H3467]] 
12 Be strong [[H2388]] and let us fight bravely [[H2388]] for [[H1157]] our people [[H5971]] and for [[H1157]] the cities [[H5892]] of our God. [[H430]] May the LORD [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] what is good [[H2896]] in His sight.” [[H5869]] 
13 So Joab [[H3097]] and his troops [[H5971]] advanced [[H5066]] to fight [[H4421]] the Arameans, [[H758]] who fled [[H5127]] before him. [[H6440]] 
14 When the Ammonites [[H1121]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the Arameans [[H758]] had fled, [[H5127]] they too fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] Abishai, [[H52]] and they entered [[H935]] the city. [[H5892]] So Joab [[H3097]] returned [[H7725]] from [fighting] against [[H5921]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] and came [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
15 When the Arameans [[H758]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they had been defeated [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] they regrouped. [[H622]] 
16 Hadadezer [[H1909]] sent [[H7971]] messengers to bring [[H3318]] [more] Arameans [[H758]] from beyond [[H5676]] the Euphrates, [[H5104]] and they came [[H935]] to Helam [[H2431]] with Shobach [[H7731]] the commander [[H8269]] of Hadadezer’s [[H1909]] army [[H6635]] leading them. [[H6440]] 
17 When this was reported [[H5046]] to David, [[H1732]] he gathered [[H622]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] and went [[H935]] to Helam. [[H2431]] Then the Arameans [[H758]] arrayed themselves [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] David [[H1732]] and fought [[H3898]] against him. [[H5973]] 
18 But the Arameans [[H758]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] and David [[H1732]] killed [[H2026]] seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] charioteers [[H7393]] and forty [[H705]] thousand [[H505]] foot soldiers. [[H6571]] He also struck down [[H5221]] Shobach [[H7731]] commander [[H8269]] of their army, [[H6635]] who died [[H4191]] there. [[H8033]] 
19 When all [[H3605]] the kings [who were] [[H4428]] subject [[H5650]] to Hadadezer [[H1909]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they had been defeated [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] they made peace [[H7999]] with [[H854]] Israel [[H3478]] and became subject to them. [[H5647]] So the Arameans [[H758]] were afraid [[H3372]] to help [[H3467]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] anymore. [[H5750]]
