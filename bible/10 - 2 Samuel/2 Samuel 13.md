1 After some time, [[H1961]] David’s [[H1732]] son [[H1121]] Amnon [[H550]] fell in love [[H157]] with Tamar, [[H8559]] the beautiful [[H3303]] sister [[H269]] of David’s [[H1732]] son [[H1121]] Absalom. [[H53]] 
2 Amnon [[H550]] was sick [[H2470]] with frustration [[H3334]] over [[H5668]] his sister [[H269]] Tamar, [[H8559]] for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] was a virgin, [[H1330]] and it seemed [[H5869]] implausible [[H6381]] for [him] [[H550]] to do [[H6213]] anything [[H3972]] to her.  
3 Now Amnon [[H550]] had a friend [[H7453]] named [[H8034]] Jonadab, [[H3122]] the son [[H1121]] of David’s [[H1732]] brother [[H251]] Shimeah. [[H8093]] Jonadab [[H3122]] was a very [[H3966]] shrewd [[H2450]] man, [[H376]] 
4 so he asked Amnon, [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] are you, [[H859]] the son [[H1121]] of the king, [[H4428]] so [[H3602]] depressed [[H1800]] morning [[H1242]] after morning? [[H1242]] Won't [[H3808]] you tell [[H5046]] me?”  Amnon [[H550]] replied, [[H559]] “I am [[H589]] in love [[H157]] with Tamar, [[H8559]] my brother [[H251]] Absalom’s [[H53]] sister.” [[H269]] 
5 Jonadab [[H3082]] told [[H559]] him,  “Lie down [[H7901]] on [[H5921]] your bed [[H4904]] and pretend you are ill. [[H2470]] When your father [[H1]] comes [[H935]] to see you, [[H7200]] say [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] ‘Please [[H4994]] let my sister [[H269]] Tamar [[H8559]] come [[H935]] and give me something [[H1262]] to eat. [[H3899]] Let her prepare [[H6213]] [it] [[H1279]] in my sight [[H5869]] so [[H4616]] I may watch her [[H7200]] and eat it [[H398]] from her hand. [[H3027]] 
6 So Amnon [[H550]] lay down [[H7901]] and feigned illness. [[H2470]] When the king [[H4428]] came [[H935]] to see him, [[H7200]] Amnon [[H550]] said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] let my sister [[H269]] Tamar [[H8559]] come [[H935]] and make a couple [[H8147]] of cakes [[H3834]] in my sight, [[H5869]] so that I may eat [[H1262]] from her hand.” [[H3027]] 
7 Then David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] Tamar [[H8559]] at the palace: [[H1004]] “Please [[H4994]] go [[H1980]] to the house [[H1004]] of Amnon [[H550]] your brother [[H251]] and prepare [[H6213]] a meal [[H1279]] for him.”  
8 So Tamar [[H8559]] went [[H1980]] to the house [[H1004]] of her brother [[H251]] Amnon, [[H550]] [who] [[H1931]] was lying down. [[H7901]] She took [[H3947]] some dough, [[H1217]] kneaded [it], [[H3888]] made cakes [[H3823]] in his sight, [[H5869]] and baked [[H1310]] them. [[H3834]] 
9 Then she brought [[H3947]] the pan [[H4958]] and set it down [[H3332]] before him, [[H6440]] but he refused [[H3985]] to eat. [[H398]] “Send everyone [[H3605]] away!” [[H3318]] said [[H559]] Amnon. [[H550]] And everyone [[H3605]] went out. [[H3318]] 
10 Then Amnon [[H550]] said [[H559]] to Tamar, [[H8559]] “Bring [[H935]] the food [[H1279]] into the bedroom, [[H2315]] so that I may eat it [[H1262]] from your hand.” [[H3027]] Tamar [[H8559]] took [[H3947]] the cakes [[H3834]] she had made [[H6213]] and went [[H935]] to her brother [[H251]] Amnon’s [[H550]] bedroom. [[H2315]] 
11 And when she had brought [them] [[H5066]] to him [[H413]] to eat, [[H398]] he took hold [[H2388]] of her  and said, [[H559]] “Come, [[H935]] lie [[H7901]] with me, [[H5973]] my sister!” [[H269]] 
12 “No, [[H408]] my brother!” [[H251]] she cried. [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] humiliate me, [[H6031]] for [[H3588]] such [[H3651]] a thing should never [[H3808]] be done [[H6213]] in Israel. [[H3478]] Do not [[H408]] do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] disgraceful thing! [[H5039]] 
13 Where [[H575]] could I [[H589]] ever take [[H1980]] my shame? [[H2781]] And as for you, [[H859]] you would be [[H1961]] like one [[H259]] of the fools [[H5036]] in Israel! [[H3478]] Please [[H4994]] speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] he will not [[H3808]] withhold me [[H4513]] from you.” [[H4480]] 
14 But [Amnon] refused [[H3808]] to listen to her, [[H8085]] and being stronger, [[H2388]] he violated her [[H6031]] and lay with [[H7901]] her. [[H854]] 
15 Then Amnon [[H550]] hated [Tamar] [[H8130]] with such intensity [[H1419]] that [[H3588]] his hatred [[H8135]] was greater than [[H1419]] the love [[H160]] he previously had. [[H157]] “Get up!” [[H6965]] he said [[H559]] to her.  “Be gone!” [[H1980]] 
16 “No,” [[H408]] she replied, [[H559]] “sending me away [[H7971]] [is worse] than [[H312]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] wrong [[H7451]] you have already done [[H6213]] to me!” [[H5973]] But he refused [[H3808]] to listen [[H8085]] to her.  
17 Instead, he called [[H7121]] to his attendant [[H5288]] and said, [[H559]] “Throw [[H7971]] this [woman] [[H2063]] out [[H2351]] and bolt [[H5274]] the door [[H1817]] behind her!” [[H310]] 
18 So Amnon’s attendant [[H8334]] threw [[H3318]] her [[H853]] out [[H2351]] and bolted [[H5274]] the door [[H1817]] behind her. [[H310]] Now Tamar was wearing [[H5921]] a robe [[H3801]] of many colors, [[H6446]] because [[H3588]] this is what [[H3651]] the king’s [[H4428]] virgin [[H1330]] daughters [[H1323]] wore. [[H3847]] 
19 And Tamar [[H8559]] put [[H3947]] ashes [[H665]] on [[H5921]] her head [[H7218]] and tore [[H7167]] her robe. [[H3801]] And putting [[H7760]] her hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] her head, [[H7218]] she went away [[H1980]] crying bitterly. [[H2199]] 
20 Her brother [[H251]] Absalom [[H53]] said [[H559]] to her: [[H413]] “Has your brother [[H251]] Amnon [[H550]] been [[H1961]] with you? [[H5973]] Be quiet [[H2790]] for now, [[H6258]] my sister. [[H269]] He [[H1931]] is your brother. [[H251]] Do not [[H408]] take [[H7896]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] to heart.” [[H3820]] So Tamar [[H8559]] lived [[H3427]] as a desolate [[H8076]] woman in the house [[H1004]] of her brother [[H251]] Absalom. [[H53]] 
21 When King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] this, [[H428]] he was furious. [[H2734]] 
22 And Absalom [[H53]] never [[H3808]] said a word [[H1696]] to [[H5973]] Amnon, [[H550]] either good [[H2896]] or bad, [[H7451]] because [[H3588]] he [[H53]] hated [[H8130]] Amnon [[H550]] for [[H5921]] disgracing [[H6031]] his sister [[H269]] Tamar. [[H8559]] 
23 Two years later, [[H8141]] when Absalom’s [[H53]] sheepshearers [[H1494]] were [[H1961]] at Baal-hazor [[H1178]] near [[H5973]] Ephraim, [[H669]] he [[H53]] invited [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the king’s [[H4428]] sons. [[H1121]] 
24 And he [[H53]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] “Your servant [[H5650]] has just [[H2009]] hired shearers. [[H1494]] Will the king [[H4428]] and his servants [[H5650]] please [[H4994]] come [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] [me]?” [[H5650]] 
25 “No, [[H408]] my son,” [[H1121]] the king [[H4428]] replied, [[H559]] “we should not [[H408]] all [[H3605]] go, [[H1980]] or [[H3808]] we would be a burden [[H3513]] to you.” [[H5921]] Although Absalom urged [[H6555]] him,  he was not [[H3808]] willing [[H14]] to go, [[H1980]] but gave him his blessing. [[H1288]] 
26 “If not,” [[H3808]] said [[H559]] Absalom, [[H53]] “please [[H4994]] let my brother [[H251]] Amnon [[H550]] go [[H1980]] with us.” [[H854]] “Why [[H4100]] should he go [[H1980]] with you?” [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] asked. [[H559]] 
27 But Absalom [[H53]] urged him, [[H6555]] so he sent [[H7971]] Amnon [[H550]] and the rest of [[H3605]] the king’s [[H4428]] sons. [[H1121]] 
28 Now Absalom [[H53]] had ordered [[H6680]] his young men, [[H5288]] “Watch [[H7200]] Amnon [[H550]] until [[H4994]] his heart [[H3820]] is merry [[H2896]] with wine, [[H3196]] and when [[H559]] I order [[H559]] you to strike [[H5221]] Amnon {down}, [[H550]] you are to kill him. [[H4191]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid. [[H3372]] Have [[H3588]] I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] commanded [[H6680]] you? [[H853]] Be courageous [[H2388]] and [[H1961]] valiant! [[H2428]] 
29 So Absalom’s [[H53]] young men [[H5288]] did [[H6213]] to Amnon [[H550]] just as [[H834]] Absalom [[H53]] had ordered. [[H6680]] Then all [[H3605]] the rest of the king’s [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] got up, [[H6965]] and each one [[H376]] fled [[H5127]] on [[H5921]] his mule. [[H6505]] 
30 While they [[H1992]] were [[H1961]] on the way, [[H1870]] a report [[H8052]] reached [[H935]] David: [[H1732]] “Absalom [[H53]] has struck down [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the king’s [[H4428]] sons; [[H1121]] not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of them [[H1992]] is left!” [[H3498]] 
31 Then the king [[H4428]] stood up, [[H6965]] tore [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] and lay down [[H7901]] on the ground; [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] stood [[H5324]] by with their clothes [[H899]] torn. [[H7167]] 
32 But Jonadab, [[H3122]] the son [[H1121]] of David’s [[H1732]] brother [[H251]] Shimeah, [[H8093]] spoke up: [[H6030]] “My lord [[H113]] must not [[H408]] think [[H559]] they have killed [[H4191]] all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of the king, [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] only [[H905]] Amnon [[H550]] is dead. [[H4191]] In fact, [[H3588]] Absalom [[H53]] has planned this [[H7760]] since the day [[H3117]] Amnon violated [[H6031]] his sister [[H269]] Tamar. [[H8559]] 
33 So now, [[H6258]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] do not [[H408]] take [[H7760]] to [[H413]] heart [[H3820]] the report that [[H1697]] all [[H3605]] the king’s [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] are dead. [[H4191]] Only [[H905]] Amnon [[H550]] is dead.” [[H4191]] 
34 Meanwhile, Absalom [[H53]] had fled. [[H1272]] When the young man [[H5288]] standing watch [[H6822]] looked up, [[H5375]] he saw [[H7200]] many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] coming [[H1980]] down the road [[H1870]] west of him, [[H310]] along the side [[H6654]] of the hill. (And the watchman went and reported to the king, “I see men coming from the direction of Horonaim, along the side of the hill.”) [[H2022]] 
35 So Jonadab [[H3122]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “Look, [[H2009]] the king’s [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] have arrived! [[H935]] It is just as [[H3651]] your servant [[H5650]] said.” [[H1697]] 
36 And as he finished [[H3615]] speaking, [[H1696]] the king’s [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] came in, [[H935]] wailing [[H1058]] loudly. [[H5375]] Then the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] also [[H1571]] wept [[H1058]] very [[H3966]] bitterly. [[H1419]] 
37 Now Absalom [[H53]] fled [[H1272]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Talmai [[H8526]] son [[H1121]] of Ammihud, [[H5991]] the king [[H4428]] of Geshur. [[H1650]] But David mourned [[H56]] for [[H5921]] his son [[H1121]] every [[H3605]] day. [[H3117]] 
38 After Absalom [[H53]] had fled [[H1272]] and gone [[H1980]] to Geshur, [[H1650]] he stayed [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]] 
39 Then the spirit [[H1732]] of the king [[H4428]] longed [[H3615]] to go [[H3318]] to [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] for [[H3588]] he had been consoled [[H5162]] over [[H5921]] Amnon’s [[H550]] death. [[H4191]]
