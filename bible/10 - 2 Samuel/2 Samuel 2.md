# 2 Samuel 2
[[2 Samuel 1|←]] • [[2 Samuel 3|→]]
1 Some time later, [[H310]] David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] “Should I go up [[H5927]] to one [[H259]] of the towns [[H5892]] of Judah?” [[H3063]] “Go up,” [[H5927]] the LORD [[H3068]] answered. [[H559]] Then David [[H1732]] asked, [[H559]] “Where [[H575]] should I go?” [[H5927]] “To Hebron,” [[H2275]] replied the LORD. [[H559]] 
2 So David [[H1732]] went [[H5927]] there [[H8033]] with his two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] Ahinoam [[H293]] of Jezreel [[H3159]] and Abigail, [[H26]] the widow [[H802]] of Nabal [[H5037]] of Carmel. [[H3761]] 
3 David also [[H1732]] took [[H5927]] the men [[H376]] who [[H834]] were with him, [[H5973]] each [[H376]] with his household, [[H1004]] and they settled [[H3427]] in the towns [[H5892]] near Hebron. [[H2275]] 
4 Then the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] came [to Hebron], [[H935]] and there [[H8033]] they anointed [[H4886]] David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]] And they told [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] “It was the men [[H376]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] who buried [[H6912]] Saul.” [[H7586]] 
5 So David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] to tell [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “The LORD [[H3068]] bless [[H1288]] you, [[H859]] because [[H834]] you have shown [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] Saul [[H7586]] your lord [[H113]] when you buried him. [[H6912]] 
6 Now [[H6258]] may the LORD [[H3068]] show [[H6213]] you [[H5973]] loving devotion [[H2617]] and truth, [[H571]] and I [[H595]] will also [[H1571]] show [[H6213]] you [[H854]] the same [[H2063]] favor [[H2896]] because [[H834]] you have done [[H6213]] this. [[H2088]] 
7 Now then, [[H6258]] be strong [[H2388]] and courageous, [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] though Saul [[H7586]] your lord [[H113]] is dead, [[H4191]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] has anointed me [[H4886]] as their king.” [[H4428]] 
8 Meanwhile, Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] the commander [[H8269]] of Saul’s [[H7586]] army, [[H6635]] took [[H3947]] Saul’s [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] Ish-bosheth, [[H378]] moved him [[H5674]] to Mahanaim, [[H4266]] 
9 and made him king [[H4427]] over [[H413]] Gilead, [[H1568]] Asher, [[H805]] Jezreel, [[H3157]] Ephraim, [[H669]] Benjamin— [[H1144]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
10 Saul’s [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] Ish-bosheth [[H378]] was forty [[H705]] years old [[H1121]] when he began to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and he reigned [[H4427]] for two [[H8147]] years. [[H8141]] The house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] however, [[H389]] followed [[H1961]] David. [[H1732]] 
11 And the length [[H4557]] of time [[H3117]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] was [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] in Hebron [[H2275]] over [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] was seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] and six [[H8337]] months. [[H2320]] 
12 One day Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner [[H5369]] and the servants [[H5650]] of Ish-bosheth [[H378]] son [[H1121]] of Saul [[H7586]] marched out [[H3318]] from Mahanaim [[H4266]] to Gibeon. [[H1391]] 
13 So Joab [[H3097]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] along with the servants [[H5650]] of David, [[H1732]] marched out [[H3318]] and met them [[H6298]] by [[H5921]] the pool [[H1295]] of Gibeon. [[H1391]] And the two camps [[H428]] took up positions [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] opposite sides [[H2088]] of the pool. [[H1295]] 
14 Then Abner [[H74]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] “Let us have the young men [[H5288]] get up [[H6965]] and compete [[H7832]] before us.” [[H6440]] “Let them get up,” [[H6965]] Joab [[H3097]] replied. [[H559]] 
15 So they got up [[H6965]] and were counted off— [[H4557]] twelve [[H8147]] for Benjamin [[H1144]] and Ish-bosheth [[H378]] son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and twelve [[H8147]] for David. [[H1732]] 
16 Then each man [[H376]] grabbed [[H2388]] his opponent [[H7453]] by the head [[H7218]] and thrust his sword [[H2719]] into his opponent’s [[H7453]] side, [[H6654]] and they all fell [[H5307]] together. [[H3162]] So this [[H1931]] place, [[H4725]] which [[H834]] is in Gibeon, [[H1391]] is called [[H7121]] the Field of Swords. [[H2521]] 
17 The battle [[H4421]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] was [[H1961]] intense, [[H7186]] and Abner [[H74]] and the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] were defeated [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] the servants [[H5650]] of David. [[H1732]] 
18 The three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] were [[H1961]] there: [[H8033]] Joab, [[H3097]] Abishai, [[H52]] and Asahel. [[H6214]] Now Asahel [[H6214]] [was] fleet [[H7031]] of foot [[H7272]] like a [[H259]] wild [[H7704]] gazelle, [[H6643]] 
19 and he [[H6214]] chased [[H7291]] Abner, [[H74]] not [[H3808]] turning [[H5186]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left [[H8040]] in his pursuit. [[H74]] 
20 And Abner [[H74]] glanced [[H6437]] back [[H310]] and said, [[H559]] “Is that [[H2088]] you, [[H859]] Asahel?” [[H6214]] “It is,” [[H595]] Asahel replied. [[H559]] 
21 So Abner [[H74]] told him, [[H559]] “Turn [[H5186]] to [[H5921]] your right [[H3225]] or [[H176]] to [[H5921]] your left, [[H8040]] seize [[H270]] one [[H259]] of the young men, [[H5288]] and take [[H3947]] his equipment [[H2488]] for yourself.”  But Asahel [[H6214]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] stop [[H5493]] chasing him. [[H310]] 
22 Once again, [[H3254]] Abner [[H74]] warned [[H559]] Asahel, [[H6214]] “Stop [[H5493]] chasing me. [[H310]] Why [[H4100]] should I strike [[H5221]] you to the ground? [[H776]] How [[H349]] could I show [[H5375]] my face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] your brother [[H251]] Joab?” [[H3097]] 
23 But Asahel refused [[H3985]] to turn away; [[H5493]] so Abner [[H74]] thrust [[H5221]] the butt [[H310]] of his spear [[H2595]] into [[H413]] his stomach, [[H2570]] and [it] [[H2595]] came out [[H3318]] his back, [[H310]] and he fell [[H5307]] dead [[H4191]] on the spot. [[H8033]] And every man [[H3605]] paused [[H5975]] when he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] Asahel [[H6214]] had fallen [[H5307]] and died. [[H4191]] 
24 But Joab [[H3097]] and Abishai [[H52]] pursued [[H7291]] Abner. [[H74]] By sunset, [[H8121]] they [[H1992]] had gone [[H935]] as [[H5704]] far as the hill [[H1389]] of Ammah [[H522]] opposite [[H5921]] Giah [[H1520]] on the way [[H1870]] to the wilderness [[H4057]] of Gibeon. [[H1391]] 
25 The Benjamites [[H1121]] rallied [[H6908]] to Abner, [[H74]] formed [[H1961]] a single [[H259]] unit, [[H92]] and took their stand [[H5975]] atop [[H7218]] a [[H259]] hill. [[H1389]] 
26 Then Abner [[H74]] called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Joab: [[H3097]] “Must the sword [[H2719]] devour forever? [[H398]] Do you not [[H3808]] realize [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this will only end [[H314]] in bitterness? [[H4751]] How long [[H5704]] before you tell [[H559]] the troops [[H5971]] to stop [[H7725]] pursuing [[H310]] their brothers?” [[H251]] 
27 “As surely as God [[H430]] lives,” [[H2416]] Joab [[H3097]] replied, [[H559]] “if you had not [[H3588]] spoken up, [[H1696]] the troops [[H5971]] would have continued [[H5927]] pursuing [[H310]] their brothers [[H251]] until morning.” [[H1242]] 
28 So Joab [[H3097]] blew [[H8628]] the trumpet, [[H7782]] and all [[H3605]] the troops [[H5971]] stopped; [[H5975]] they no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] pursued [[H7291]] Israel [[H3478]] or continued [[H3254]] to fight. [[H3898]] 
29 And all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] Abner [[H74]] and his men [[H582]] marched [[H1980]] through the Arabah. [[H6160]] They crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] marched [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] morning, [[H1338]] and arrived [[H935]] at Mahanaim. [[H4266]] 
30 When Joab [[H3097]] returned [[H7725]] from pursuing [[H310]] Abner, [[H74]] he gathered [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the troops. [[H5971]] In addition to Asahel, [[H6214]] nineteen [[H8672]] of David’s [[H1732]] servants [[H5650]] were missing, [[H6485]] 
31 but they [[H5650]] had struck down [[H5221]] 360 [[H7969]] men [[H376]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] and Abner. [[H74]] 
32 Later, they took [[H5375]] Asahel [[H6214]] and buried him [[H6912]] in his father’s [[H1]] tomb [[H6913]] in Bethlehem. [[H1035]] Then Joab [[H3097]] and his men [[H376]] marched [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] night [[H3915]] and reached  Hebron [[H2275]] at daybreak. [[H215]]
