# Jonah 2
[[Jonah 1|←]] • [[Jonah 3|→]]
1 From inside [[H4578]] the fish [[H1710]] Jonah [[H3124]] prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] 
2 saying: [[H559]] “In my distress [[H6869]] I called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] and He answered me. [[H6030]] From the belly [[H990]] of Sheol [[H7585]] I called for help, [[H7768]] [and] You heard [[H8085]] my voice. [[H6963]] 
3 For You cast me [[H7993]] into the deep, [[H4688]] into the heart [[H3824]] of the seas, [[H3220]] and the current [[H5104]] swirled about me. [[H5437]] All [[H3605]] Your breakers [[H4867]] and waves [[H1530]] swept [[H5674]] over me. [[H5921]] 
4 At this, I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] ‘I have been banished [[H1644]] from [[H5048]] Your sight; [[H5869]] yet [[H389]] I will look [[H5027]] once more [[H3254]] toward [[H413]] Your holy [[H6944]] temple.’ [[H1964]] 
5 The waters [[H4325]] engulfed me [[H661]] up to [[H5704]] the neck; [[H5315]] the watery depths [[H8415]] overcame me; [[H5437]] the seaweed [[H5488]] wrapped [[H2280]] around my head. [[H7218]] 
6 To the roots [[H7095]] of the mountains [[H2022]] I descended; [[H3381]] the earth [[H776]] beneath me [[H1157]] barred me in [[H1280]] forever! [[H5769]] But You raised [[H5927]] my life [[H2416]] from the pit, [[H7845]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God! [[H430]] 
7 As my life [[H5315]] was fading away, [[H5848]] I remembered [[H2142]] the LORD. [[H3069]] My prayer [[H8605]] went up [[H935]] to You, [[H413]] to [[H413]] Your holy [[H6944]] temple. [[H1964]] 
8 Those who cling to [[H8104]] worthless [[H7723]] idols [[H1892]] forsake [[H5800]] [His] loving devotion. [[H2617]] 
9 But I, [[H589]] with the voice [[H6963]] of thanksgiving, [[H8426]] will sacrifice [[H2076]] to You.  I will fulfill [[H7999]] what [[H834]] I have vowed. [[H5087]] Salvation [[H3444]] is from the LORD!” [[H3068]] 
10 And the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H559]] the fish, [[H1709]] and it vomited [[H6958]] Jonah [[H3124]] onto [[H413]] dry land. [[H3004]]
