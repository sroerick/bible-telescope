1 Simon [[G4826]] Peter, [[G4074]] a servant [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] apostle [[G652]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] To those who [[G3588]] through [[G1722]] [the] righteousness [[G1343]] of our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Savior [[G4990]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] have received [[G2975]] a faith [[G4102]] as precious [[G2472]] as ours: [[G1473]] 
2 Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] be multiplied [[G4129]] to you [[G4771]] through [[G1722]] [the] knowledge [[G1922]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
3 His [[G846]] divine [[G2304]] power [[G1411]] has given [[G1433]] us [[G1473]] everything [[G3956]] [we need] [[G3588]] for [[G4314]] life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] godliness [[G2150]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1922]] of Him who [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] us [[G1473]] [by His] own [[G2398]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] excellence. [[G703]] 
4 Through [[G1223]] [these] [[G3739]] He has given [[G1433]] us [[G1473]] [His] [[G3588]] precious [[G5093]] and [[G2532]] magnificent [[G3173]] promises, [[G1862]] so that [[G2443]] through [[G1223]] [them] [[G3778]] you may become [[G1096]] partakers [[G2844]] of [the] divine [[G2304]] nature, [[G5449]] now that you have escaped [[G668]] the [[G3588]] corruption [[G5356]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] caused by [[G1722]] evil desires. [[G1939]] 
5 For this [[G3778]] very [reason], [[G846]] make [[G3923]] every [[G3956]] effort [[G4710]] to add [[G2023]] to [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] virtue; [[G703]] and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] virtue, [[G703]] knowledge; [[G1108]] 
6 and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] knowledge, [[G1108]] self-control; [[G1466]] and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] self-control, [[G1466]] perseverance; [[G5281]] and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] perseverance, [[G5281]] godliness; [[G2150]] 
7 and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] godliness, [[G2150]] brotherly kindness; [[G5360]] and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] brotherly kindness, [[G5360]] love. [[G26]] 
8 For [[G1063]] [if] you [[G4771]] possess [[G5225]] these [ qualities ] [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] continue to grow [in them], [[G4121]] they will keep you from being [[G2525]] ineffective [[G692]] and [[G3761]] unproductive [[G175]] in [[G1519]] [your] [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1922]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
9 [But] [[G1063]] whoever [[G3739]] lacks [[G3918]] these [ traits ] [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] nearsighted [[G3467]] to the point of blindness, [[G5185]] having forgotten [[G3024]] that [[G3588]] he has been cleansed [[G2512]] from his [[G846]] past [[G3819]] sins. [[G266]] 
10 Therefore, [[G1352]] brothers, [[G80]] be all the more eager [[G4704]] to make [[G4160]] your [[G4771]] calling [[G2821]] and [[G2532]] election [[G1589]] sure. [[G949]] For [[G1063]] if you practice [[G4160]] these things [[G3778]] {you will} never [[G3756]] stumble, [[G4417]] 
11 and [[G1063]] you [[G4771]] will receive [[G2023]] a lavish [[G4146]] reception [[G1529]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] eternal [[G166]] kingdom [[G932]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Savior [[G4990]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
12 Therefore, [[G1352]] I will [[G3195]] always [[G104]] remind [[G5279]] you [[G4771]] of [[G4012]] these things, [[G3778]] even though [[G2539]] you know [them] [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] are established [[G4741]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] you now have. [[G3918]] 
13 I think it is [[G2233]] right [[G1342]] to refresh [[G1326]] your [[G4771]] memory [[G5280]] as [[G1909]] long as [[G3745]] I [live] [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tent [ of my body ], [[G4638]] 
14 since I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [it] [[G4638]] will [[G1510]] soon [[G5031]] be laid aside, [[G595]] as [[G2531]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] has made clear [[G1213]] to me. [[G1473]] 
15 And [[G1161]] I will make every effort to ensure [[G4704]] [that] after [[G3326]] my [[G1699]] departure, [[G1841]] you [[G4771]] will [[G2192]] be able to recall [[G3420]] these things [[G3778]] at all times. [[G1539]] 
16 For [[G1063]] we did not follow [[G1811]] cleverly devised [[G4679]] fables [[G3454]] when we made known [[G1107]] to you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] coming [[G3952]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] but [[G235]] we were [[G1096]] eyewitnesses [[G2030]] of His [[G1565]] majesty. [[G3168]] 
17 For [[G1063]] He received [[G2983]] honor [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] from [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] [when] the voice [[G5456]] from [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Majestic [[G3169]] Glory [[G1391]] said [[G5342]] to Him, [[G846]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] Son, [[G5207]] in [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am well pleased. [[G2106]] 
18 And [[G2532]] we ourselves [[G1473]] heard [[G191]] this [[G3778]] voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] [when] we were [[G1510]] with [[G4862]] Him [[G846]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] mountain. [[G3735]] 
19 We also have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] of the prophets, [[G4397]] [which] has been confirmed beyond doubt. [[G949]] [And] you will do [[G4160]] well [[G2573]] to pay attention [[G4337]] to [this message], [[G3739]] as [[G5613]] to a lamp [[G3088]] shining [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] [a] dark [[G850]] place, [[G5117]] until [[G2193]] [the] [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] dawns [[G1306]] and [[G2532]] [the] morning star [[G5459]] rises [[G393]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts. [[G2588]] 
20 Above all, [[G4412]] you must understand [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] no [[G3756]] prophecy [[G4394]] of Scripture [[G1124]] comes [[G1096]] from [the prophet’s] own [[G2398]] interpretation. [[G1955]] 
21 For [[G1063]] no [[G3756]] prophecy [[G4394]] {was} ever [[G4218]] brought about [[G5342]] through human initiative, [[G2307]] but [[G235]] men [[G444]] spoke [[G2980]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] as they were carried along [[G5342]] by [[G5259]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]]
