# 3 John 1
[[2 John 1|←]] • [[Jude 1|→]]
1 The [[G3588]] elder, [[G4245]] To the [[G3588]] beloved [[G27]] Gaius, [[G1050]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] love [[G25]] in [[G1722]] [the] truth: [[G225]] 
2 Beloved, [[G27]] I pray that [[G2172]] in [[G4012]] every way [[G3956]] you [[G4771]] may prosper [[G2137]] and [[G2532]] enjoy good health, [[G5198]] as [[G2531]] your [[G4771]] soul {also} [[G5590]] prospers. [[G2137]] 
3 For [[G1063]] I was overjoyed [[G5463]] [when the] brothers [[G80]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] testified [[G3140]] about your [[G4771]] devotion to the truth, [[G225]] in [[G1722]] [which] [[G225]] you [[G4771]] continue to walk. [[G4043]] 
4 I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] greater [[G3173]] joy [[G5479]] than [[G3778]] to [[G2443]] hear [that] [[G191]] my [[G1699]] children [[G5043]] are walking [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] 
5 Beloved, [[G27]] you are [[G4160]] faithful [[G4103]] in what [[G3739]] you are doing [[G2038]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] brothers, [[G80]] and [especially since] [[G2532]] they are [[G3778]] strangers [to you]. [[G3581]] 
6 [They] [[G3739]] have testified [[G3140]] to [[G1799]] [the] church [[G1577]] about your [[G4771]] love. [[G26]] You will do [[G4160]] well [[G2573]] to send them on their way [[G4311]] in a manner worthy [[G516]] of God. [[G2316]] 
7 For [[G1063]] they went out [[G1831]] on behalf [[G5228]] of the [[G3588]] Name, [[G3686]] accepting [[G2983]] nothing [[G3367]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1482]] 
8 Therefore [[G3767]] we [[G1473]] ought [[G3784]] to support [[G5274]] such [men], [[G5108]] so that [[G2443]] we may be [[G1096]] fellow workers [[G4904]] for the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] 
9 I have written [[G1125]] to the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] [about this], [[G5100]] but [[G235]] Diotrephes, [[G1361]] who [[G3588]] loves to be first, [[G5383]] will not accept [[G1926]] our [instruction]. [[G1473]] 
10 So [[G1223]] if [[G1437]] I come, [[G2064]] I will call attention to [[G5279]] [his] [[G3739]] malicious [[G4190]] slander [[G5396]] [against] us. [[G1473]] And [[G2532]] unsatisfied [[G714]] with [[G1909]] that, [[G3778]] he refuses to welcome [[G1926]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] and [[G2532]] forbids [[G2967]] those who [[G3588]] want to do so, [[G1014]] even [[G2532]] putting [them] [[G1544]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]] 
11 Beloved, [[G27]] {do} not [[G3361]] imitate [[G3401]] what [is] [[G3588]] evil, [[G2556]] but [[G235]] what [is] [[G3588]] good. [[G18]] The [one who] [[G3588]] does good [[G15]] is [[G1510]] of [[G1537]] God; [[G2316]] the [one who] [[G3588]] does evil [[G2554]] has not seen [[G3708]] God. [[G2316]] 
12 Demetrius [[G1216]] has received a good testimony [[G3140]] from [[G5259]] everyone, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] from [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] itself. [[G846]] We [[G1473]] also [[G1161]] testify [for him], [[G3140]] and [[G2532]] you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] our [[G1473]] testimony [[G3141]] is [[G1510]] true. [[G227]] 
13 I have [[G2192]] many things [[G4183]] to write [[G1125]] you, [[G4771]] but [[G235]] I would prefer [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] [to do so] [[G1125]] with [[G1223]] pen [[G2563]] and [[G2532]] ink. [[G3188]] 
14 Instead, [[G1161]] I hope [[G1679]] to see [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] soon [[G2112]] and [[G2532]] speak [[G2980]] [face] [[G4750]] to [[G4314]] [face]. [[G4750]] Peace [[G1515]] to you. [[G4771]] The [[G3588]] friends [ here ] [[G5384]] send you greetings. [[G782]] Greet [[G782]] [each of our] [[G3588]] friends [there] [[G5384]] by [[G2596]] name. [[G3686]]
