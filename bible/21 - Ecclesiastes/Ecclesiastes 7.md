# Ecclesiastes 7
[[Ecclesiastes 6|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 8|→]]
1 A good name [[H8034]] is better [[H2896]] than fine [[H2896]] perfume, [[H8081]] and one’s day [[H3117]] of death [[H4194]] [is better] than his day [[H3117]] of birth. [[H3205]] 
2 It is better [[H2896]] to enter [[H1980]] a house [[H1004]] of mourning [[H60]] than [[H1980]] a house [[H1004]] of feasting, [[H4960]] since [[H834]] [death] [[H1931]] [is] the end [[H5490]] of every [[H3605]] man, [[H120]] and the living [[H2416]] should take [this] [[H5414]] to [[H413]] heart. [[H3820]] 
3 Sorrow [[H3708]] is better [[H2896]] than laughter, [[H7814]] for [[H3588]] a sad [[H7455]] countenance [[H6440]] is good [[H3190]] for the heart. [[H3820]] 
4 The heart [[H3820]] of the wise [[H2450]] [is] in the house [[H1004]] of mourning, [[H60]] but the heart [[H3820]] of fools [[H3684]] is in the house [[H1004]] of pleasure. [[H8057]] 
5 It is better [[H2896]] to heed [[H8085]] a wise man’s [[H2450]] rebuke [[H1606]] than [[H376]] to listen [[H8085]] to the song [[H7892]] of fools. [[H3684]] 
6 For [[H3588]] like the crackling [[H6963]] of thorns [[H5518]] under [[H8478]] the pot, [[H5518]] so [[H3651]] is the laughter [[H7814]] of the fool— [[H3684]] this [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile. [[H1892]] 
7 Surely [[H3588]] extortion [[H6233]] turns a wise man [[H2450]] into a fool, [[H1984]] and a bribe [[H4979]] corrupts [[H6]] the heart. [[H3820]] 
8 The end [[H319]] of a matter [[H1697]] is better [[H2896]] than the beginning, [[H7225]] [and] a patient [[H750]] spirit [[H7307]] is better [[H2896]] than a proud [[H1362]] [one]. [[H7307]] 
9 Do not [[H408]] be quickly [[H926]] provoked [[H3707]] in your spirit, [[H7307]] for [[H3588]] anger [[H3708]] settles [[H5117]] in the lap [[H2436]] of a fool. [[H3684]] 
10 Do not [[H408]] say, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] were [[H1961]] the old [[H7223]] days [[H3117]] better [[H2896]] than these?” [[H428]] For [[H3588]] it is unwise [[H2451]] of you to ask [[H7592]] about [[H5921]] this. [[H2088]] 
11 Wisdom, [[H2451]] like [[H5973]] an inheritance, [[H5159]] [is] good, [[H2896]] and it benefits [[H3148]] those who see [[H7200]] the sun. [[H8121]] 
12 For [[H3588]] wisdom, [[H2451]] like money, [[H3701]] [is] a shelter, [[H6738]] and the advantage [[H3504]] of knowledge [[H1847]] is that wisdom [[H2451]] preserves the life [[H2421]] of its owner. [[H1167]] 
13 Consider [[H7200]] the work [[H4639]] of God: [[H430]] Who [[H4310]] can [[H3201]] straighten [[H8626]] what [[H834]] He has bent? [[H5791]] 
14 In the day [[H3117]] of prosperity [[H2896]] be [[H1961]] joyful, [[H2896]] but in the day [[H3117]] of adversity, [[H7451]] consider this: [[H7200]] God [[H430]] has made [[H6213]] one [of these] [[H2088]] along with [[H5980]] the other, [[H2088]] so that [[H5921]] a man [[H120]] cannot [[H3808]] discover [[H4672]] anything [[H3972]] that will come after him. [[H310]] 
15 In my futile [[H1892]] life [[H3117]] I have seen [[H7200]] both of these: [[H3605]] A righteous man [[H6662]] perishing [[H6]] in his righteousness, [[H6664]] [and] [[H3426]] a wicked man [[H7563]] living long [[H748]] in his wickedness. [[H7451]] 
16 Do not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] overly [[H7235]] righteous, [[H6662]] and do not [[H408]] make yourself too [[H3148]] wise. [[H2449]] Why [[H4100]] should you destroy yourself? [[H8074]] 
17 Do not [[H408]] be excessively [[H7235]] wicked, [[H7561]] and do not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] a fool. [[H5530]] Why [[H4100]] should you die [[H4191]] before [[H3808]] your time? [[H6256]] 
18 It is good [[H2896]] to grasp [[H270]] the one [[H2088]] and [[H1571]] not [[H408]] let the other slip [[H3240]] from [[H2088]] your hand. [[H3027]] For [[H3588]] he who fears [[H3373]] God [[H430]] will follow [[H3318]] both [warnings]. [[H3605]] 
19 Wisdom [[H2451]] makes the wise man [[H2450]] stronger than [[H5810]] ten [[H6235]] rulers [[H7989]] in a city. [[H5892]] 
20 Surely [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] righteous [[H6662]] man [[H120]] on earth [[H776]] who [[H834]] does [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] and never [[H3808]] sins. [[H2398]] 
21 Do not [[H408]] pay [[H5414]] attention [[H3820]] to every [[H3605]] word [[H1697]] that is spoken, [[H1696]] or [[H834]] you may hear [[H8085]] your servant [[H5650]] cursing you. [[H7043]] 
22 For [[H3588]] you know [[H3045]] in your heart [[H3820]] that [[H834]] many [[H7227]] times [[H6471]] you yourself [[H859]] have cursed [[H7043]] others. [[H312]] 
23 All [[H3605]] this [[H2090]] I tested [[H5254]] by wisdom, [saying], [[H2451]] “I resolve [[H559]] to be wise.” [[H2449]] But it [[H1931]] was beyond [[H7350]] me. [[H4480]] 
24 What [[H4100]] exists [[H1961]] is out of reach [[H7350]] and very deep. [[H6013]] Who [[H4310]] can fathom it? [[H4672]] 
25 I [[H589]] directed [[H5437]] my mind [[H3820]] to understand, [[H3045]] to explore, [[H8446]] to search out [[H1245]] wisdom [[H2451]] and explanations, [[H2808]] and to understand [[H1847]] the stupidity [[H3689]] of wickedness [[H7562]] and the folly [[H5531]] of madness. [[H1947]] 
26 And I [[H589]] find [[H4672]] more bitter [[H4751]] than [[H4480]] death [[H4194]] the woman [[H802]] who [[H834]] [is] a snare, [[H4685]] whose heart [[H3820]] [is] a net, [[H2764]] and whose hands [[H3027]] [are] chains. [[H612]] The man who pleases [[H2896]] God [[H430]] will escape her, [[H4422]] but the sinner [[H2398]] will be ensnared. [[H3920]] 
27 “Behold,” [[H7200]] says [[H559]] the Teacher, [[H6953]] “I have discovered [[H4672]] this [[H2088]] by adding one [[H259]] thing to another [[H259]] to find [[H4672]] an explanation. [[H2808]] 
28 While [[H834]] my soul [[H5315]] was still [[H5750]] searching [[H1245]] but not [[H3808]] finding, [[H4672]] among a thousand [[H505]] I have found [[H4672]] one [[H259]] [upright] man, [[H120]] but among all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] I have not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] a [virtuous] woman. [[H802]] 
29 Only [[H905]] this [[H2088]] have I found: [[H7200]] I have discovered [[H4672]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] made [[H6213]] men [[H120]] upright, [[H3477]] but they [[H1992]] have sought out [[H1245]] many [[H7227]] schemes.” [[H2810]]
