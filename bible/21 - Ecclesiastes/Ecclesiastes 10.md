# Ecclesiastes 10
[[Ecclesiastes 9|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 11|→]]
1 As dead [[H4194]] flies [[H2070]] bring [[H5042]] a stench [[H887]] to the perfumer’s [[H7543]] oil, [[H8081]] so a little [[H4592]] folly [[H5531]] outweighs [[H3368]] wisdom [[H2451]] and honor. [[H3519]] 
2 A wise man’s [[H2450]] heart [[H3820]] inclines to the right, [[H3225]] but the heart [[H3820]] of a fool [[H3684]] to the left. [[H8040]] 
3 Even [[H1571]] as the fool [[H5530]] walks [[H1980]] along the road, [[H1870]] his sense [[H3820]] is lacking, [[H2638]] and he shows [[H559]] everyone [[H3605]] that he [[H1931]] is a fool. [[H5530]] 
4 If [[H518]] the ruler’s [[H4910]] temper [[H7307]] flares [[H5927]] against you, [[H5921]] do not [[H408]] abandon [[H3240]] your post, [[H4725]] for [[H3588]] calmness [[H4832]] {lays} great [[H1419]] offenses [[H2399]] to rest. [[H3240]] 
5 There is [[H3426]] an evil [[H7451]] I have seen [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the sun— [[H8121]] an error [[H7684]] that proceeds [[H3318]] from [[H6440]] the ruler: [[H7989]] 
6 Folly [[H5529]] is appointed [[H5414]] to great [[H7227]] heights, [[H4791]] but the rich [[H6223]] sit [[H3427]] in lowly positions. [[H8216]] 
7 I have seen [[H7200]] slaves [[H5650]] on [[H5921]] horseback, [[H5483]] while princes [[H8269]] go [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] foot [[H776]] like slaves. [[H5650]] 
8 He who digs [[H2658]] a pit [[H1475]] may fall into it, [[H5307]] and he who breaches [[H6555]] a wall [[H1447]] may be bitten [[H5391]] by a snake. [[H5175]] 
9 The one who quarries [[H5265]] stones [[H68]] may be injured [[H6087]] by them,  and he who splits [[H1234]] logs [[H6086]] endangers himself. [[H5533]] 
10 If [[H518]] the ax [[H1270]] is dull [[H6949]] and [[H1931]] the blade [[H6440]] unsharpened, [[H7043]] more strength [[H2428]] must be exerted, [[H1396]] but skill [[H2451]] will produce [[H3504]] success. [[H3787]] 
11 If [[H518]] the snake [[H5175]] bites [[H5391]] before [[H3808]] it is charmed, [[H3908]] there is no [[H369]] profit [[H3504]] for the charmer. [[H1167]] 
12 The words [[H1697]] of a wise man’s [[H2450]] mouth [[H6310]] are gracious, [[H2580]] but the lips [[H8193]] of a fool [[H3684]] consume him. [[H1104]] 
13 The beginning [[H8462]] of his talk [[H1697]] is folly, [[H5531]] and the end [[H319]] of his speech [[H6310]] is evil [[H7451]] madness. [[H1948]] 
14 Yet the fool [[H5530]] multiplies [[H7235]] words. [[H1697]] No [[H3808]] one [[H120]] knows [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] is coming, [[H1961]] and who [[H4310]] can tell [[H5046]] him  what [[H834]] will come [[H1961]] after him? [[H310]] 
15 The toil [[H5999]] of a fool [[H3684]] wearies him, [[H3021]] for [[H834]] he does not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] the way [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the city. [[H5892]] 
16 Woe to you, [[H337]] O land [[H776]] whose king [[H4428]] is a youth, [[H5288]] and whose princes [[H8269]] feast [[H398]] in the morning. [[H1242]] 
17 Blessed are you, [[H835]] O land [[H776]] whose king [[H4428]] is a son [[H1121]] of nobles, [[H2715]] and whose princes [[H8269]] feast [[H398]] at the proper time— [[H6256]] [to be] strong [[H1369]] rather than [[H3808]] to become drunk. [[H8358]] 
18 Through laziness [[H6103]] the roof [[H4746]] caves in, [[H4355]] and in the hands [[H3027]] of the idle, [[H8220]] the house [[H1004]] leaks. [[H1811]] 
19 A feast [[H3899]] is prepared [[H6213]] for laughter, [[H7814]] and wine [[H3196]] makes life [[H2416]] merry, [[H8055]] but money [[H3701]] is the answer [[H6030]] for everything. [[H3605]] 
20 Do not [[H408]] curse [[H7043]] the king [[H4428]] even [[H1571]] in your thoughts, [[H4093]] [or] [[H408]] curse [[H7043]] the rich [[H6223]] even in your bedroom, [[H2315]] for [[H3588]] a bird [[H5775]] of the sky [[H8064]] may carry [[H1980]] your words, [[H6963]] and a winged creature [[H1167]] may report [[H5046]] your speech.
