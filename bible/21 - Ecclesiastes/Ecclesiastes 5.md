# Ecclesiastes 5
[[Ecclesiastes 4|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 6|→]]
1 Guard [[H8104]] your steps [[H7272]] when [[H834]] you go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]] Draw near [[H7138]] to listen [[H8085]] rather than to offer [[H5414]] the sacrifice [[H2077]] of fools, [[H3684]] who [[H3588]] do not [[H369]] know that [[H3045]] they do [[H6213]] wrong. [[H7451]] 
2 Do not [[H408]] be hasty [[H926]] to [[H5921]] speak, [[H6310]] and do not let your heart [[H3820]] be [[H408]] hasty [[H4116]] to utter [[H3318]] a word [[H1697]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]] After all, [[H3588]] God [[H430]] is in heaven [[H8064]] and you [[H859]] are on [[H5921]] earth. [[H776]] So [[H5921]] let your words [[H1697]] be [[H1961]] few. [[H4592]] 
3 As [[H3588]] a dream [[H2472]] comes [[H935]] through many [[H7230]] cares, [[H6045]] so the speech [[H6963]] of a fool [[H3684]] [comes] with many [[H7230]] words. [[H1697]] 
4 When [[H834]] you make [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] to God, [[H430]] do not [[H408]] delay [[H309]] in fulfilling it, [[H7999]] because [[H3588]] He takes no [[H369]] pleasure [[H2656]] in fools. [[H3684]] Fulfill [[H7999]] your vow. [[H5087]] 
5 It is better [[H2896]] not [[H3808]] to vow [[H5087]] than to make a vow [[H5087]] and not [[H3808]] fulfill it. [[H7999]] 
6 Do not [[H408]] let [[H5414]] your mouth [[H6310]] cause your body [[H1320]] to sin, [[H2398]] and do not [[H408]] tell [[H559]] the messenger [[H4397]] that [[H3588]] [your vow] [[H1931]] was a mistake. [[H7684]] Why [[H4100]] should God [[H430]] be angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] your words [[H6963]] and destroy [[H2254]] the work [[H4639]] of your hands? [[H3027]] 
7 For as [[H3588]] many [[H7230]] dreams [[H2472]] bring futility, [[H1892]] so do many [[H7235]] words. [[H1697]] Therefore, [[H3588]] fear [[H3372]] God. [[H430]] 
8 If [[H518]] you see [[H7200]] the oppression [[H6233]] of the poor [[H7326]] and the denial [[H1499]] of justice [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6664]] in the province, [[H4082]] do not [[H408]] be astonished [[H8539]] at [[H5921]] the matter; [[H2656]] for [[H3588]] one official [[H1364]] is watched by [[H8104]] a superior, [[H1364]] and higher still [[H1364]] are over them. [[H5921]] 
9 The produce [[H3504]] of the earth [[H776]] is taken by all; [[H3605]] the king himself [[H4428]] profits [[H5647]] from the fields. [[H7704]] 
10 He who loves [[H157]] money [[H3701]] is never [[H3808]] satisfied [[H7646]] by money, [[H3701]] and he who [[H4310]] loves [[H157]] wealth [[H1995]] is never [[H3808]] satisfied by income. [[H8393]] This [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile. [[H1892]] 
11 When good things [[H2896]] increase, [[H7235]] so do [[H7235]] those who consume them; [[H398]] what then [[H4100]] is the profit [[H3788]] to the owner, [[H1167]] except [[H3588]] to behold them [[H7200]] with his eyes? [[H5869]] 
12 The sleep [[H8142]] of the worker [[H5647]] is sweet, [[H4966]] whether [[H518]] he eats [[H398]] little [[H4592]] or [[H518]] much, [[H7235]] but the abundance [[H7647]] of the rich man [[H6223]] permits [[H3240]] him  no [[H369]] sleep. [[H3462]] 
13 There is [[H3426]] a grievous [[H2470]] evil [[H7451]] I have seen [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the sun: [[H8121]] wealth [[H6239]] hoarded [[H8104]] to the harm [[H7451]] of its owner, [[H1167]] 
14 or [[H1931]] wealth [[H6239]] lost [[H6]] in a bad [[H7451]] venture, [[H6045]] so that when he has [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] there is nothing [[H369]] to pass on. [[H3027]] 
15 As [[H834]] [a man] came [[H3318]] from his mother’s [[H517]] womb, [[H990]] so he will depart [[H1980]] again: [[H7725]] naked [[H6174]] as he arrived. [[H935]] He takes [[H5375]] nothing [[H3972]] for his labor [[H5999]] to carry [[H1980]] in his hands. [[H3027]] 
16 This [[H2090]] too [[H1571]] is a grievous [[H2470]] evil: [[H7451]] Exactly as [[H3605]] a man is born, [[H935]] so [[H3651]] he will depart. [[H1980]] What [[H4100]] does he gain [[H3504]] as he toils [[H5998]] for the wind? [[H7307]] 
17 Moreover, [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] his days [[H3117]] he eats [[H398]] in darkness, [[H2822]] with much [[H7235]] sorrow, [[H3708]] sickness, [[H2483]] and anger. [[H7110]] 
18 Here [[H2009]] is what [[H834]] I [[H589]] have seen [[H7200]] to be good [[H2896]] and fitting: [[H3303]] to eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and to find [[H7200]] satisfaction [[H2896]] in all [[H3605]] the labor [[H5999]] one does [[H5998]] under [[H8478]] the sun [[H8121]] during the few [[H4557]] days [[H3117]] of life [[H2416]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] has given him [[H5414]] for [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] is his lot. [[H2506]] 
19 Furthermore, [[H1571]] God [[H430]] has given [[H5414]] riches [[H6239]] and wealth [[H5233]] to  every [[H3605]] man, [[H120]] and He has enabled [[H7980]] him to enjoy them, [[H398]] to accept [[H5375]] his lot, [[H2506]] and to rejoice [[H8055]] in his labor. [[H5999]] This [[H2090]] is a gift [[H4991]] from God. [[H430]] 
20 For [[H3588]] [a man] seldom [[H3808]] considers [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of his life, [[H2416]] because [[H3588]] God [[H430]] keeps him occupied [[H6031]] with the joy [[H8057]] of his heart. [[H3820]]
