# Ecclesiastes 6
[[Ecclesiastes 5|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 7|→]]
1 There is [[H3426]] another evil [[H7451]] I have seen [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] and it [[H1931]] weighs heavily [[H7227]] upon [[H5921]] mankind: [[H120]] 
2 God [[H430]] gives [[H5414]] a man [[H376]] riches, [[H6239]] wealth, [[H5233]] and honor, [[H3519]] so that he lacks [[H2638]] nothing [[H369]] his heart [[H5315]] desires; [[H183]] but God [[H430]] does not [[H3808]] allow [[H7980]] him to enjoy them. [[H398]] Instead, [[H3588]] a stranger [[H376]] will enjoy them. [[H398]] This [[H2088]] is futile [[H1892]] and a grievous [[H2483]] evil. [[H7451]] 
3 A man [[H376]] may father [[H3205]] a hundred [children] [[H3967]] and live [[H2421]] for many [[H7227]] years; [[H8141]] yet no matter how long [[H7227]] he lives, [[H3117]] if he [[H5315]] is unsatisfied [[H7646]] with [[H4480]] his prosperity [[H2896]] and does not [[H3808]] even [[H1571]] receive a proper burial, [[H6900]] I say [[H559]] that a stillborn child [[H5309]] is better off [[H2896]] than he. [[H4480]] 
4 For [[H3588]] he enters [[H935]] in futility [[H1892]] and departs [[H1980]] in darkness, [[H2822]] and his name [[H8034]] is shrouded [[H3680]] in obscurity. [[H2822]] 
5 [A stillborn child] [[H2088]] has more rest [[H5183]] than he— [[H2088]] though [[H1571]] never [[H3808]] seeing [[H7200]] the sun [[H8121]] or [[H3808]] knowing anything— [[H3045]] 
6 if [[H432]] he lives [[H2421]] a thousand [[H505]] years [[H8141]] twice over, [[H6471]] but fails to [[H3808]] enjoy [[H7200]] his prosperity. [[H2896]] Do not [[H3808]] all [[H3605]] go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the same [[H259]] place? [[H4725]] 
7 All [[H3605]] a man’s [[H120]] labor [[H5999]] [is] for his mouth, [[H6310]] yet [[H1571]] his appetite [[H5315]] is never [[H3808]] satisfied. [[H4390]] 
8 What [[H4100]] advantage, [[H3148]] then, [[H3588]] has the wise man [[H2450]] over [[H4480]] the fool? [[H3684]] What [gain comes] [[H4100]] to the poor man [[H6041]] who knows [[H3045]] how to conduct [[H1980]] himself before [[H5048]] others? [[H2416]] 
9 Better [[H2896]] what the eye [[H5869]] can see [[H4758]] than the wandering [[H1980]] of desire. [[H5315]] This [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile [[H1892]] and a pursuit [[H7469]] of the wind. [[H7307]] 
10 Whatever [[H4100]] exists [[H1961]] was named [[H7121]] long ago, [[H3528]] and what [happens] [[H834]] to a man [[H120]] is foreknown; [[H3045]] but he [[H1931]] cannot [[H3808]] contend [[H1777]] with [[H5973]] one stronger [[H8630]] than he. [[H4480]] 
11 For [[H3588]] the more [[H7235]] words, [[H1697]] the more [[H7235]] futility— [[H1892]] and how [[H4100]] does that profit [[H3148]] anyone? [[H120]] 
12 For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] knows [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] is good [[H2896]] for a man [[H120]] during the few [[H4557]] days [[H3117]] he passes through [[H6213]] his fleeting [[H1892]] life [[H2416]] like a shadow? [[H6738]] Who [[H4310]] can tell [[H5046]] a man [[H120]] what [[H4100]] will come [[H1961]] after him [[H310]] under [[H8478]] the sun? [[H8121]]
