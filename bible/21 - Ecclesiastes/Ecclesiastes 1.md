# Ecclesiastes 1
[[Proverbs 31|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 2|→]]
1 The words [[H1697]] of the Teacher, [[H6953]] the son [[H1121]] of David, [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] 
2 “Futility [[H1892]] of futilities,” [[H1892]] says [[H559]] the Teacher, [[H6953]] “futility [[H1892]] of futilities! [[H1892]] Everything [[H3605]] is futile!” [[H1892]] 
3 What [[H4100]] does a man [[H120]] gain [[H3504]] from all [[H3605]] his labor, [[H5999]] at which he toils [[H5998]] under [[H8478]] the sun? [[H8121]] 
4 Generations [[H1755]] come [[H1980]] and generations [[H1755]] go, [[H935]] but the earth [[H776]] remains [[H5975]] forever. [[H5769]] 
5 The sun [[H8121]] rises [[H2224]] and the sun [[H8121]] sets; [[H935]] it hurries back [[H7602]] to [[H4725]] where [[H8033]] it [[H1931]] arose. [[H2224]] 
6 Blowing [[H1980]] southward, [[H1864]] then turning [[H5437]] northward, [[H6828]] round [[H5437]] [and] round [[H5437]] the wind [[H7307]] swirls, [[H1980]] ever returning [[H7725]] on [[H5921]] [its] [[H7307]] course. [[H5439]] 
7 All [[H3605]] the rivers [[H5158]] flow [[H1980]] into [[H413]] the sea, [[H3220]] yet the sea [[H3220]] is never [[H369]] full; [[H4392]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] from which the streams [[H5158]] come, [[H1980]] there [[H8033]] again [[H7725]] they [[H1992]] flow. [[H1980]] 
8 All [[H3605]] things [[H1697]] are wearisome, [[H3023]] more [[H3808]] than one [[H376]] can describe; [[H1696]] the eye [[H5869]] is not [[H3808]] satisfied [[H7646]] with seeing, [[H7200]] nor [[H3808]] the ear [[H241]] content [[H4390]] with hearing. [[H8085]] 
9 What [[H4100]] has been [[H1961]] is what [[H1931]] will be, [[H1961]] and what [[H4100]] has been done [[H6213]] will be done again; [[H6213]] there is nothing [[H369]] new [[H2319]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]] 
10 Is there [a case] [[H3426]] where one can say, [[H559]] “Look, [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] is new”? [[H2319]] It [[H1931]] has already [[H3528]] existed [[H1961]] in the ages [[H5769]] before us. [[H6440]] 
11 There is no [[H369]] remembrance [[H2146]] of those who came before, [[H7223]] and those to come [[H314]] will not be [[H1961]] remembered [[H2146]] by [[H5973]] those who [[H1961]] follow [[H1961]] after. [[H314]] 
12 I, [[H589]] the Teacher, [[H6953]] was [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
13 And I set [[H5414]] my mind [[H3820]] to seek [[H1875]] and explore [[H8446]] by wisdom [[H2451]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] heaven. [[H8064]] What [[H1931]] a heavy [[H7451]] burden [[H6045]] God [[H430]] has laid on [[H5414]] the sons [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] to keep them occupied! [[H6031]] 
14 I have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the things [[H4639]] that are done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] and have found [[H2009]] them all [[H3605]] to be futile, [[H1892]] a pursuit [[H7469]] of the wind. [[H7307]] 
15 What is crooked [[H5791]] cannot [[H3808]] be straightened, [[H8626]] and what is lacking [[H2642]] cannot [[H3808]] be counted. [[H4487]] 
16 I [[H589]] said [[H1696]] to [[H5973]] myself, [[H3820]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] have grown [[H1431]] and increased [[H3254]] in wisdom [[H2451]] beyond [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] those [[H834]] before me [[H6440]] who were [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and my mind [[H3820]] has observed [[H7200]] a wealth [[H7235]] of wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge. [[H1847]] 
17 So I set [[H5414]] my mind [[H3820]] to know [[H3045]] wisdom [[H2451]] [and] [[H3045]] madness [[H1947]] and folly; [[H5531]] I learned [[H3045]] that [[H2088]] this, [[H1931]] too, [[H1571]] is a pursuit [[H7475]] of the wind. [[H7307]] 
18 For [[H3588]] with much [[H7230]] wisdom [[H2451]] comes much [[H7227]] sorrow, [[H3708]] and as knowledge [[H1847]] grows, [[H3254]] grief [[H4341]] increases. [[H3254]]
