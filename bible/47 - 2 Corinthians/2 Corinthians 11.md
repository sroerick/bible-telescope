1 I hope [[G3785]] you will bear with [[G430]] a [[G5100]] little [[G3398]] of my [[G1473]] foolishness, [[G877]] but [[G235]] [you are already doing that]. [[G430]] 
2 I am jealous for [[G2206]] you [[G4771]] with a godly [[G2316]] jealousy. [[G2205]] For [[G1063]] I promised [[G718]] you [[G4771]] to one [[G1520]] husband, [[G435]] to present [you] [[G3936]] [as] a pure [[G53]] virgin [[G3933]] to Christ. [[G5547]] 
3 I am afraid, [[G5399]] however, [[G1161]] that just [[G4459]] as [[G5613]] Eve [[G2096]] was deceived [[G1818]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] serpent’s [[G3789]] cunning, [[G3834]] your [[G4771]] minds [[G3540]] may be led astray [[G5351]] from [[G575]] [your] [[G3588]] simple [[G572]] and [[G2532]] pure [devotion] [[G54]] to [[G1519]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
4 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] [someone] [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] [and] proclaims [[G2784]] [a] Jesus [[G2424]] other [[G243]] [than the One] [[G3739]] we proclaimed, [[G2784]] or if [[G2228]] you receive [[G2983]] a different [[G2087]] spirit [[G4151]] [than the One] [[G3739]] you received, [[G2983]] or [[G2228]] a different [[G2087]] gospel [[G2098]] [than the one] [[G3739]] you accepted, [[G1209]] you put up with it [[G430]] way too easily. [[G2573]] 
5 I consider myself [[G3049]] in no way [[G3367]] inferior [[G5302]] to those [[G3588]] “super-apostles.” [[G5228]] 
6 Although [[G2532]] [I am] not a polished [[G2399]] speaker, [[G3056]] I am certainly not lacking [[G3756]] in knowledge. [[G1108]] We have made this clear [[G5319]] to [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] every way possible. [[G3956]] 
7 [Was it] [[G2228]] a sin [[G266]] [for me] [[G4160]] to humble [[G5013]] myself [[G1683]] in order to [[G2443]] exalt you, [[G5312]] because [[G3754]] I preached [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of God [[G2316]] to you [[G4771]] free of charge? [[G1432]] 
8 I robbed [[G4813]] other [[G243]] churches [[G1577]] by accepting [[G2983]] [their] support [[G3800]] in order [[G4314]] to serve [[G1248]] you. [[G4771]] 
9 And [[G2532]] when I was [[G3918]] with [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] in need, [[G5302]] I was not a burden [[G2655]] [to anyone]; [[G3762]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] who came [[G2064]] from [[G575]] Macedonia [[G3109]] supplied [[G4322]] my [[G1473]] needs. [[G5303]] I have refrained [[G5083]] from being a burden [[G4]] to you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] any way, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] I will continue to do so. [[G5083]] 
10 [As surely as the] truth [[G225]] of Christ [[G5547]] is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1473]] this [[G3778]] boasting [[G2746]] of [[G1519]] mine [[G1473]] will not be silenced [[G5420]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] regions [[G2824]] of Achaia. [[G882]] 
11 Why? [[G1223]] Because [[G3754]] I do not love [[G25]] you? [[G4771]] God [[G2316]] knows [I do]! [[G1492]] 
12 But [[G1161]] I will keep on doing [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] I am doing, [[G4160]] in order [[G2443]] to undercut [[G1581]] those who [[G3588]] want [[G2309]] an opportunity [[G874]] to [[G2443]] be regarded as [[G2147]] our equals [[G2531]] in [[G1722]] the things [[G3739]] they boast about. [[G2744]] 
13 For [[G1063]] such men [are] [[G5108]] false apostles, [[G5570]] deceitful [[G1386]] workers, [[G2040]] masquerading [[G3345]] as [[G1519]] apostles [[G652]] of Christ. [[G5547]] 
14 And [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] wonder, [[G2295]] for [[G1063]] Satan [[G4567]] himself [[G846]] masquerades [[G3345]] as [[G1519]] an angel [[G32]] of light. [[G5457]] 
15 [It is] not [[G3756]] surprising, [[G3173]] then, [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] his [[G846]] servants [[G1249]] masquerade [[G3345]] as [[G5613]] servants [[G1249]] of righteousness. [[G1343]] [Their] [[G3739]] end [[G5056]] will correspond to [[G1510]] their [[G846]] actions. [[G2041]] 
16 I repeat: [[G3004]] {Let} no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] take [[G1380]] me [[G1473]] for [[G1510]] a fool. [[G878]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] [you do], [[G1490]] [then] receive [[G1209]] me [[G1473]] as [[G5613]] a fool, [[G878]] so that [[G2443]] I too [[G2504]] may boast [[G2744]] a [[G5100]] little. [[G3398]] 
17 In [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] confident [[G5287]] boasting [of mine], [[G2746]] I am not speaking [[G2980]] as [[G2596]] [the] Lord {would}, [[G2962]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] a fool. [[G877]] 
18 Since [[G1893]] many [[G4183]] are boasting [[G2744]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] I too [[G2504]] will boast. [[G2744]] 
19 For [[G1063]] you gladly tolerate [[G430]] fools, [[G878]] since you are [[G1510]] so wise. [[G5429]] 
20 In fact, [[G1063]] you even put up with [[G430]] anyone who [[G5100]] enslaves [[G2615]] you [[G4771]] [or] [[G1487]] exploits [you] [[G2719]] [or] [[G1487]] takes advantage [of you] [[G2983]] [or] [[G1487]] exalts himself [[G1869]] [or] [[G1487]] strikes [[G1194]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1519]] the face. [[G4383]] 
21 To [[G2596]] [my] shame [[G819]] I concede [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] we [[G1473]] were too weak [for that]! [[G770]] Speaking [[G3004]] as a fool, [[G877]] however, [[G1161]] I can [[G2504]] [match] [[G5111]] what [[G3739]] anyone else [[G5100]] dares [to boast about]. [[G5111]] 
22 Are they [[G1510]] Hebrews? [[G1445]] So am I. [[G2504]] Are they [[G1510]] Israelites? [[G2475]] So am I. [[G2504]] Are they [[G1510]] descendants [[G4690]] of Abraham? [[G11]] So am I. [[G2504]] 
23 Are they [[G1510]] servants [[G1249]] of Christ? [[G5547]] I am speaking [[G2980]] like I am out of my mind, [[G3912]] [but] I am [[G1473]] so much more: [[G5228]] in [[G1722]] harder [[G4057]] labor, [[G2873]] in [[G1722]] more [[G4057]] imprisonments, [[G5438]] in [[G1722]] worse [[G5234]] beatings, [[G4127]] in [[G1722]] frequent [[G4178]] danger of death. [[G2288]] 
24 Five times [[G3999]] I received [[G2983]] from [[G5259]] [the] Jews [[G2453]] [the] forty [lashes] [[G5062]] minus [[G3844]] one. [[G1520]] 
25 Three times [[G5151]] I was beaten with rods, [[G4463]] once [[G530]] I was stoned, [[G3034]] three times [[G5151]] I was shipwrecked. [[G3489]] I spent [[G4160]] a night and a day [[G3574]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] open [sea]. [[G1037]] 
26 In my frequent journeys, [[G3597]] [I have been] in danger [[G2794]] from rivers [[G4215]] [and] [[G2794]] from bandits, [[G3027]] in danger [[G2794]] from [my] [[G1537]] countrymen [[G1085]] [and] [[G2794]] from [[G1537]] [the] Gentiles, [[G1484]] in danger [[G2794]] in [[G1722]] [the] city [[G4172]] [and] [[G2794]] in [[G1722]] [the] country, [[G2047]] in danger [[G2794]] on [[G1722]] [the] sea [[G2281]] [and] [[G2794]] among [[G1722]] false brothers, [[G5569]] 
27 in labor [[G2873]] and [[G2532]] toil [[G3449]] [and] often [[G4178]] without sleep, [[G70]] in [[G1722]] hunger [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] thirst [[G1373]] [and] often [[G4178]] without food, [[G3521]] in [[G1722]] cold [[G5592]] and [[G2532]] exposure. [[G1132]] 
28 Apart from [[G5565]] these external [[G3924]] [trials], [[G3588]] I [face] [[G1473]] daily [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] pressure [[G1999]] [of my] [[G3588]] concern [[G3308]] for all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]] 
29 Who [[G5101]] is weak, [[G770]] and [[G2532]] I am not weak? [[G770]] Who [[G5101]] is led into sin, [[G4624]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] {do} not [[G3756]] burn with grief? [[G4448]] 
30 If [[G1487]] I must [[G1163]] boast, [[G2744]] I will boast [[G2744]] [of] the things [[G3588]] [that show] [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] weakness. [[G769]] 
31 The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] forever [[G165]] worthy of praise, [[G2128]] knows [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I am not lying. [[G5574]] 
32 In [[G1722]] Damascus, [[G1154]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G1481]] under [[G3588]] King [[G935]] Aretas [[G702]] secured [[G5432]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] of the Damascenes [[G1153]] in order to arrest [[G4084]] me. [[G1473]] 
33 But [[G2532]] I was lowered [[G5465]] in [[G1722]] a basket [[G4553]] through [[G1223]] a window [[G2376]] in [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] wall [[G5038]] and [[G2532]] escaped [[G1628]] his [[G846]] grasp. [[G5495]]
