1 Therefore, [[G1223]] since we have [[G2192]] this [[G3778]] ministry [[G1248]] through [[G2531]] the mercy [of God], [[G1653]] we do not lose heart. [[G1573]] 
2 Instead, [[G235]] we have renounced [[G550]] secret [[G2927]] [and] shameful [ways]. [[G152]] We do not practice [[G4043]] deceit, [[G3834]] nor [[G3366]] do we distort [[G1389]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God. [[G2316]] On the contrary, [[G235]] by open proclamation [[G5321]] of the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] we commend [[G4921]] ourselves [[G1438]] to [[G4314]] every [[G3956]] mans [[G444]] conscience [[G4893]] in the sight of [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]] 
3 And [[G1161]] even [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] our [[G1473]] gospel [[G2098]] is [[G1510]] veiled, [[G2572]] it is [[G1510]] veiled [[G2572]] to [[G1722]] those who [[G3588]] are perishing. [[G622]] 
4 The [[G3588]] god [[G2316]] of this [[G3778]] age [[G165]] has blinded [[G5186]] the [[G3588]] minds [[G3540]] of [[G3588]] unbelievers [[G571]] so [[G1519]] they cannot see [[G826]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5462]] of the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] image [[G1504]] of God. [[G2316]] 
5 For [[G1063]] we do not proclaim [[G2784]] ourselves, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [as] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G1161]] ourselves [[G1438]] [as] your [[G4771]] servants [[G1401]] for Jesus’ [[G2424]] sake. [[G1223]] 
6 For [[G3754]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] “{Let} light [[G5457]] shine [[G2989]] out of [[G1537]] darkness,” [[G4655]] made His light shine [[G2989]] in [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] hearts [[G2588]] to give us [[G4314]] [the] light [[G5462]] of the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1108]] of the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] [the] face [[G4383]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
7 Now [[G1161]] we have [[G2192]] this [[G3778]] treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] jars [[G4632]] of clay [[G3749]] to show that [[G2443]] [this] [[G3588]] surpassingly great [[G5236]] power [[G1411]] is [[G1510]] from God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] from [[G1537]] us. [[G1473]] 
8 We are pressed [[G2346]] on [[G1722]] all [sides], [[G3956]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] crushed; [[G4729]] perplexed, [[G639]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] in despair; [[G1820]] 
9 persecuted, [[G1377]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] forsaken; [[G1459]] struck down, [[G2598]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] destroyed. [[G622]] 
10 {We} always [[G3842]] carry around [[G4064]] in [[G1722]] [our] [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] the [[G3588]] death [[G3500]] [of] Jesus, [[G2424]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] of Jesus [[G2424]] {may} also [[G2532]] be revealed [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] body. [[G4983]] 
11 For [[G1063]] we [[G1473]] who [[G3588]] are alive [[G2198]] {are} always [[G104]] consigned [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] death [[G2288]] for Jesus’ [[G2424]] sake, [[G1223]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] of Jesus [[G2424]] {may} also [[G2532]] be revealed [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] mortal [[G2349]] bodies. [[G4561]] 
12 So then, [[G5620]] death [[G2288]] is at work [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G1473]] but [[G1161]] life [is at work] [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] 
13 And [[G1161]] in keeping with [[G2596]] what is written: [[G1125]] “I believed, [[G4100]] therefore [[G1352]] I have spoken,” [[G2980]] we [[G1473]] who have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] of faith [[G4102]] also [[G2532]] believe [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] therefore [[G1352]] speak, [[G2980]] 
14 knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [One who] [[G3588]] raised [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] will also raise us [[G1453]] with [[G4862]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] present [us] [[G3936]] with [[G4862]] you [ in His presence ]. [[G4771]] 
15 All this [is] [[G3956]] for your benefit, [[G1223]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] that is extending [[G4121]] to [[G1223]] more and more [people] [[G4119]] may overflow [[G4052]] in thanksgiving, [[G2169]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of God. [[G2316]] 
16 Therefore [[G1352]] we do not lose heart. [[G1573]] [Though] [[G235]] our [[G1473]] outer [[G1854]] self [[G444]] is wasting away, [[G1311]] yet [[G235]] our [[G1473]] inner [[G2080]] [self] [[G3588]] is being renewed [[G341]] day [[G2250]] by [[G2532]] day. [[G2250]] 
17 For [[G1063]] our [[G1473]] light [[G1645]] [and] temporary [[G3910]] affliction [[G2347]] is producing [[G2716]] for us [[G1473]] an eternal [[G166]] glory [[G1391]] [that] far [[G2596]] outweighs [our troubles]. [[G922]] 
18 [So] we [[G1473]] fix our eyes [[G4648]] not [[G3361]] on what [[G3588]] is seen, [[G991]] but [[G235]] on what [[G3588]] is unseen. [[G991]] For [[G1063]] what [[G3588]] is seen [[G991]] [is] temporary, [[G4340]] but [[G1161]] what [[G3588]] is unseen [[G991]] [is] eternal. [[G166]]
