# 2 Corinthians 6
[[2 Corinthians 5|←]] • [[2 Corinthians 7|→]]
1 [As] [[G1161]] [God’s] fellow workers, [[G4903]] we urge [[G3870]] you [[G4771]] not [[G3361]] to receive [[G1209]] God’s [[G2316]] grace [[G5485]] in [[G1519]] vain. [[G2756]] 
2 For [[G1063]] He says: [[G3004]] “In the time [[G2540]] of favor [[G1184]] I heard [[G1873]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] [the] day [[G2250]] of salvation [[G4991]] I helped [[G997]] you.” [[G4771]] Behold, [[G2400]] now [[G3568]] [is the] time [[G2540]] of favor; [[G2144]] now [[G3568]] [is the] day [[G2250]] of salvation! [[G4991]] 
3 We put [[G1325]] no [[G3367]] obstacle [[G4349]] in [[G1722]] [anyone’s] {way}, [[G3367]] so that [[G2443]] no one [[G3361]] can discredit [[G3469]] [our] [[G3588]] ministry. [[G1248]] 
4 Rather, [[G235]] as [[G5613]] servants [[G1249]] of God [[G2316]] we commend [[G4921]] ourselves [[G1438]] in [[G1722]] every way: [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] great [[G4183]] endurance; [[G5281]] in [[G1722]] troubles, [[G2347]] hardships, [[G318]] [and] [[G1722]] calamities; [[G4730]] 
5 in [[G1722]] beatings, [[G4127]] imprisonments, [[G5438]] [and] riots; [[G181]] in [[G1722]] labor, [[G2873]] sleepless nights, [[G70]] [and] hunger; [[G3521]] 
6 in [[G1722]] purity, [[G54]] knowledge, [[G1108]] patience, [[G3115]] [and] [[G1722]] kindness; [[G5544]] in [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] [and] in [[G1722]] sincere [[G505]] love; [[G26]] 
7 in [[G1722]] truthful [[G225]] speech [[G3056]] [and] in [[G1722]] [the] power [[G1411]] of God; [[G2316]] with [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] weapons [[G3696]] of righteousness [[G1343]] in the [[G3588]] right hand [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] in [the] left; [[G710]] 
8 through [[G1223]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] dishonor, [[G819]] slander [[G1426]] and [[G2532]] praise; [[G2162]] viewed as [[G5613]] imposters, [[G4108]] yet [[G2532]] genuine; [[G227]] 
9 as [[G5613]] unknown, [[G50]] yet [[G2532]] well-known; [[G1921]] dying, [[G599]] and yet [[G2532]] we live on; [[G2198]] punished, [[G3811]] yet [[G2532]] not killed; [[G2289]] 
10 sorrowful, [[G3076]] yet [[G1161]] always [[G104]] rejoicing; [[G5463]] poor, [[G4434]] yet [[G1161]] {making} many [[G4183]] rich; [[G4148]] having [[G2192]] nothing, [[G3367]] and yet [[G2532]] possessing [[G2722]] everything. [[G3956]] 
11 We [[G1473]] have spoken freely [[G455]] to [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] Corinthians. [[G2881]] Our [[G1473]] hearts [[G2588]] are open wide. [[G4115]] 
12 [It is] [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] our [[G1473]] affection, [[G4698]] [but] [[G1722]] yours [[G4771]] that is restrained. [[G4729]] 
13 [As] [[G1161]] a fair [[G846]] exchange, [[G489]] I ask [you] [[G3004]] as [[G5613]] [my] children: [[G5043]] Open wide [[G4115]] your [hearts] [[G4771]] also. [[G2532]] 
14 {Do} not [[G3361]] be [[G1096]] unequally yoked [[G2086]] with unbelievers. [[G571]] For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] partnership [can] [[G3352]] righteousness [[G1343]] [have with] [[G2532]] wickedness? [[G458]] Or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] fellowship [[G2842]] [does] light [have] [[G5457]] with [[G4314]] darkness? [[G4655]] 
15 What [[G5101]] harmony [[G4857]] [is there between] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G4314]] Belial? [[G955]] Or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] {does} a believer [[G4103]] have in common [[G3310]] with [[G3326]] an unbeliever? [[G571]] 
16 What [[G5101]] agreement [[G4783]] [can exist] between [[G3326]] the temple [[G3485]] of God [[G2316]] [and] idols? [[G1497]] For [[G1063]] we [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] [the] temple [[G3485]] of [the] living [[G2198]] God. [[G2316]] As [[G2531]] God [[G2316]] has said: [[G2036]] “I will live [[G1774]] with [[G1722]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] walk among [them], [[G1704]] and [[G2532]] I will be [[G1510]] their [[G846]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] will be [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] people. [[G2992]] 
17 “Therefore [[G1352]] come out [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] among them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] be separate, [[G873]] says [[G3004]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] Touch [[G680]] no [[G3361]] unclean {thing}, [[G169]] and I [[G2504]] will receive [[G1523]] you.” [[G4771]] 
18 And: [[G2532]] “I will be [[G1510]] a Father [[G3962]] to you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] will be [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] sons [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] daughters, [[G2364]] says [[G3004]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Almighty.” [[G3841]]
