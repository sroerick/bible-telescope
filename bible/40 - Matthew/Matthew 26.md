# Matthew 26
[[Matthew 25|←]] • [[Matthew 27|→]]
1 When [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] had finished {saying} [[G5055]] all [[G3956]] these [[G3778]] things, [[G3056]] He told [[G2036]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] 
2 “You know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Passover [[G3957]] begins [[G1096]] in [[G3326]] two [[G1417]] days, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be handed [[G3860]] over [[G1519]] to be crucified.” [[G4717]] 
3 At that time, [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] of the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] assembled [[G4863]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] courtyard [[G833]] of the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] whose [[G3588]] name was [[G3004]] Caiaphas, [[G2533]] 
4 and [[G2532]] they conspired [[G4823]] to [[G2443]] arrest [[G2902]] Jesus [[G2424]] covertly [[G1388]] and [[G2532]] kill [Him]. [[G615]] 
5 “But [[G1161]] not [[G3361]] during [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast,” [[G1859]] they said, [[G2036]] “or [[G2443]] there may be [[G1096]] a riot [[G2351]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people.” [[G2992]] 
6 While [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Bethany [[G963]] in [[G1722]] [the] home [[G3614]] of Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] leper, [[G3015]] 
7 a woman [[G1135]] came [[G4334]] to Him [[G846]] with [[G2192]] an alabaster jar [[G211]] of expensive [[G927]] perfume, [[G3464]] which she poured [[G2708]] on [[G1909]] His [[G846]] head [[G2776]] as He reclined at the table. [[G345]] 
8 When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] saw this, [[G3708]] they were indignant [[G23]] and asked, [[G3004]] “Why [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] waste? [[G684]] 
9 This [perfume] [[G3778]] could [[G1410]] have been sold [[G4097]] at a high price, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] [the money] given [[G1325]] to [the] poor.” [[G4434]] 
10 Aware of this, [[G1097]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked, [[G2036]] “Why [[G5101]] are you bothering [[G3930]] [this] [[G3588]] woman? [[G1135]] She has done [[G2038]] a beautiful [[G2570]] deed [[G2041]] to [[G1519]] Me. [[G1473]] 
11 The [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] you will always have [[G2192]] with [[G3326]] you, [[G1438]] but [[G1161]] {you will} not [[G3756]] always [[G3842]] have [[G2192]] Me. [[G1473]] 
12 By pouring [[G906]] this [[G3778]] perfume [[G3464]] on [[G1909]] Me, [[G1473]] she has prepared [[G4160]] My [body] [[G1473]] for [[G4314]] burial. [[G1779]] 
13 Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] wherever [[G3699]] this [[G3778]] gospel [[G2098]] is preached [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] what [[G3739]] she [[G3778]] has done [[G4160]] will also be told [[G2980]] in [[G1519]] memory of [[G3422]] her.” [[G846]] 
14 Then [[G5119]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] Twelve, [[G1427]] the [one] [[G3588]] called [[G3004]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] went [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] 
15 [and] asked, [[G2036]] “What [[G5101]] are you willing [[G2309]] to give [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] if I [[G2504]] hand [[G3860]] Him {over} [[G846]] to you?” [[G4771]] And [[G1161]] they set out [[G2476]] for him [[G846]] thirty [[G5144]] pieces of silver. [[G694]] 
16 So [[G2532]] from [[G575]] that time on [[G5119]] [Judas] looked for [[G2212]] an opportunity [[G2120]] to [[G2443]] betray [[G3860]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
17 On the [[G3588]] first [day] [[G4413]] of the [[G3588]] Feast of Unleavened Bread, [[G106]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to Jesus [[G2424]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “Where [[G4226]] do you want [[G2309]] us to prepare [[G2090]] for You [[G4771]] to eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] Passover?” [[G3957]] 
18 He answered, [[G2036]] “Go [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] to [[G4314]] a [[G3588]] certain man [[G1170]] and [[G2532]] tell [[G2036]] him [that] [[G846]] the [[G3588]] Teacher [[G1320]] says, [[G3004]] ‘My [[G1473]] time [[G2540]] is [[G1510]] near. [[G1451]] I will keep [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] Passover [[G3957]] with [[G3326]] My [[G1473]] disciples [[G3101]] at [[G4314]] your [house]. [[G4771]] 
19 So [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] did [[G4160]] as [[G5613]] Jesus [[G2424]] had directed [[G4929]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] prepared [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] Passover. [[G3957]] 
20 When [[G1161]] evening [[G3798]] came, [[G1096]] He was reclining [[G345]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] disciples. [[G3101]] 
21 And while [[G2532]] they were eating, [[G2068]] He said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] will betray [[G3860]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
22 They were deeply grieved [[G3076]] [and] began [[G756]] to ask [[G3004]] Him [[G846]] one [[G1520]] after another, [[G1538]] “Surely not [[G1510]] I, [[G1473]] Lord?” [[G2962]] 
23 [Jesus] answered, [[G611]] “The [one] [[G3588]] who has dipped [[G1686]] [his] [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] bowl [[G5165]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] will betray [[G3860]] Me. [[G1473]] 
24 The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will go [[G5217]] just as [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] about [[G4012]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] to that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] [He] [[G3588]] is betrayed. [[G3860]] It would be [[G1510]] better [[G2570]] for him [[G846]] if [[G1487]] [he] [[G1565]] had not been born. [[G1080]] 
25 Then [[G1161]] Judas, [[G2455]] who [[G3588]] would betray [[G3860]] Him, [[G846]] said, [[G611]] “Surely [[G1510]] not [[G3385]] I, [[G1473]] Rabbi?” [[G4461]] [Jesus] answered, [[G3004]] “You [[G4771]] have said [it] yourself.” [[G2036]] 
26 While [[G1161]] they [[G846]] were eating, [[G2068]] Jesus [[G2424]] took [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] spoke a blessing [[G2127]] [and] broke [it], [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] gave [it] [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] saying, [[G2036]] “Take [[G2983]] [and] eat; [[G5315]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] body.” [[G4983]] 
27 Then [[G2532]] He took [[G2983]] [the] cup, [[G4221]] gave thanks [[G2168]] [and] gave [it] [[G1325]] to them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] “Drink [[G4095]] from [[G1537]] it, [[G846]] all of you. [[G3956]] 
28 This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] covenant, [[G1242]] which [[G3588]] is poured out [[G1632]] for [[G4012]] many [[G4183]] for [[G1519]] [the] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins. [[G266]] 
29 I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] I will not drink [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] fruit [[G1081]] of the [[G3588]] vine [[G288]] from [[G575]] now on [[G737]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] when [[G3752]] I drink [[G4095]] it [[G846]] anew [[G2537]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] Fathers [[G3962]] kingdom. [[G932]] 
30 And [when] [[G2532]] they had sung a hymn, [[G5214]] they went out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of Olives. [[G1636]] 
31 Then [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “This [[G3778]] very [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] you [[G4771]] will all fall away [[G4624]] on account of [[G1722]] Me. [[G1473]] For [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] ‘I will strike [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] shepherd, [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] of the [[G3588]] flock [[G4167]] will be scattered. [[G1287]] 
32 But [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] I have risen, [[G1453]] I [[G1473]] will go ahead of [[G4254]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1519]] Galilee.” [[G1056]] 
33 Peter [[G4074]] said [[G2036]] to Him, [[G846]] “Even if [[G1487]] all [[G3956]] fall away [[G4624]] on account of [[G1722]] You, [[G4771]] I [[G1473]] never [[G3763]] will.” [[G4624]] 
34 “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you,” [[G4771]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared, [[G5346]] “this [[G3778]] very [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] before [[G4250]] [the] rooster [[G220]] crows, [[G5455]] you will deny [[G533]] Me [[G1473]] three times.” [[G5151]] 
35 Peter [[G4074]] replied, [[G3004]] “Even if [[G2579]] I must [[G1163]] die [[G599]] with [[G4862]] You, [[G4771]] I will never deny [[G533]] You.” [[G4771]] And [[G2532]] the rest of [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] said [[G2036]] the same. [[G3668]] 
36 At that time [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G2064]] with [[G3326]] [His disciples] [[G846]] to [[G1519]] a place [[G5564]] called [[G3004]] Gethsemane, [[G1068]] and [[G2532]] He told [[G3004]] [them], [[G3101]] “Sit [[G2523]] here [[G847]] while [[G2193]] I go [[G565]] over there [[G1563]] [and] pray.” [[G4336]] 
37 And [[G2532]] He took with Him [[G3880]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] sons [[G5207]] of Zebedee [[G2199]] [and] began [[G756]] to be sorrowful [[G3076]] and [[G2532]] deeply distressed. [[G85]] 
38 Then [[G5119]] He said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “My [[G1473]] soul [[G5590]] is [[G1510]] consumed with sorrow [[G4036]] to the point [[G2193]] of death. [[G2288]] Stay [[G3306]] here [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] keep watch [[G1127]] with [[G3326]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
39 Going [[G4281]] a little {farther}, [[G3398]] He fell [[G4098]] facedown [[G4383]] [and] prayed, [[G4336]] “My [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] if [[G1487]] it is [[G1510]] possible, [[G1415]] {let} this [[G3778]] cup [[G4221]] pass [[G3928]] from [[G575]] Me. [[G1473]] Yet [[G4133]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] will, [[G2309]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] You [will]. [[G4771]] 
40 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] returned [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] sleeping. [[G2518]] “Were you not able [[G2480]] to keep watch [[G1127]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] [for] one [[G1520]] hour?” [[G5610]] He asked [[G3004]] Peter. [[G4074]] 
41 “Watch [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] pray [[G4336]] so that [[G2443]] you will not enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] temptation. [[G3986]] For [[G3303]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] [is] willing, [[G4289]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4561]] [is] weak.” [[G772]] 
42 A second time [[G1208]] He went away [[G565]] [and] prayed, [[G4336]] “My [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] if [[G1487]] this [cup] [[G3778]] cannot [[G1410]] pass [[G3928]] unless [[G1437]] I drink [[G4095]] it, [[G846]] {may} Your [[G4771]] will [[G2307]] be done.” [[G1096]] 
43 Again [[G3825]] [Jesus] returned [[G2064]] [and] found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] sleeping— [[G2518]] for [[G1063]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were [[G1510]] heavy. [[G916]] 
44 So [[G2532]] He left [[G863]] them [[G846]] [and] went away [[G565]] once more [[G3825]] [and] prayed [[G4336]] [a] third time, [[G5154]] saying [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] thing. [[G3056]] 
45 Then [[G5119]] He returned [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] “Are you still sleeping [[G2518]] and [[G2532]] resting? [[G373]] Look, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] is near, [[G1448]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] is betrayed [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] [the] hands [[G5495]] of sinners. [[G268]] 
46 Rise, [[G1453]] let us go! [[G71]] See, [[G2400]] My [[G1473]] betrayer [[G3860]] is approaching!” [[G1448]] 
47 While [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was still speaking, [[G2980]] Judas, [[G2455]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] Twelve, [[G1427]] arrived, [[G2064]] accompanied by [[G3326]] a large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] [armed] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] clubs, [[G3586]] [sent] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] of the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]] 
48 Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] betrayer [[G3860]] had arranged [[G1325]] a signal [[G4592]] with them: [[G846]] “The one [[G3739]] I kiss [[G5368]] is [[G1510]] [the man]; [[G846]] arrest [[G2902]] Him.” [[G846]] 
49 Going [[G4334]] directly [[G2112]] to Jesus, [[G2424]] he said, [[G2036]] “Greetings, [[G5463]] Rabbi,” [[G4461]] and [[G2532]] kissed [[G2705]] Him. [[G846]] 
50 “Friend,” [[G2083]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G2036]] “[do] what [[G3739]] you came [[G3918]] for.” [[G1909]] Then [[G5119]] [the men] stepped forward, [[G4334]] seized [[G1911]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] arrested [[G2902]] Him. [[G846]] 
51 At this, [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G3588]] Jesus’ [[G2424]] companions [[G3326]] drew [[G645]] his [[G846]] sword [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] struck [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] of the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] cutting off [[G851]] his [[G846]] ear. [[G5621]] 
52 “Put [[G654]] your [[G4771]] sword [[G3162]] back in [[G1519]] its [[G846]] place,” [[G5117]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to him. [[G3588]] “For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] draw [[G2983]] [the] sword [[G3162]] will die [[G622]] by [[G1722]] [the] sword. [[G3162]] 
53 Are you not aware [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] I can [[G1410]] call on [[G3870]] My [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] He will at once put at My disposal [[G3936]] more than [[G4119]] twelve [[G1427]] legions [[G3003]] of angels? [[G32]] 
54 But how [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] {would} the [[G3588]] Scriptures [[G1124]] be fulfilled [[G4137]] that say [[G3754]] it must [[G1163]] happen [[G1096]] this way?” [[G3779]] 
55 At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G5610]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] “Have you come out [[G1831]] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] clubs [[G3586]] to arrest [[G4815]] Me [[G1473]] as [[G5613]] [you would] [[G1909]] an outlaw? [[G3027]] Every [[G2596]] day [[G2250]] I sat [[G2516]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] you did not arrest [[G2902]] Me. [[G1473]] 
56 But [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] has all happened [[G1096]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] writings [[G1124]] of the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] would be fulfilled.” [[G4137]] Then [[G5119]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] deserted [[G863]] Him [[G846]] [and] fled. [[G5343]] 
57 Those [[G3588]] who had arrested [[G2902]] Jesus [[G2424]] led [Him] away [[G520]] to [the house of] [[G4314]] Caiaphas [[G2533]] the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] had gathered. [[G4863]] 
58 But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] followed [[G190]] Him [[G846]] at [[G575]] a distance, [[G3113]] right up [[G2193]] to the [[G3588]] courtyard [[G833]] of the [[G3588]] high priest. [[G749]] And [[G2532]] he went [[G1525]] in [[G2080]] [and] sat down [[G2521]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] guards [[G5257]] to see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] outcome. [[G5056]] 
59 The [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] were seeking [[G2212]] false testimony [[G5577]] against [[G2596]] Jesus [[G2424]] in order to [[G3704]] put Him to death. [[G2289]] 
60 But [[G2532]] they could not find it, [[G2147]] [though] many [[G4183]] false witnesses [[G5575]] came forward. [[G4334]] Finally [[G1161]] two [[G1417]] came forward [[G4334]] 
61 [and] said, [[G2036]] “This [man] [[G3778]] declared, [[G5346]] ‘I am able [[G1410]] to destroy [[G2647]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] rebuild it [[G3618]] in [[G1223]] three [[G5140]] days.’” [[G2250]] 
62 So [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] stood up [[G450]] [and] asked [[G2036]] Him, [[G846]] “Have you no answer? [[G611]] What [[G5101]] {are} these [men] [[G3778]] testifying against [[G2649]] you?” [[G4771]] 
63 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] remained silent. [[G4623]] Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] said [[G2036]] to Him, [[G846]] “I charge You under oath [[G1844]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] God: [[G2316]] Tell [[G2036]] us [[G1473]] if [[G1487]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]] 
64 “You [[G4771]] have said [it] yourself,” [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered. [[G3004]] “But [[G4133]] I say [[G3004]] to all of you, [[G4771]] from [[G575]] now on [[G737]] you will see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G1537]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of the [[G3588]] Mighty One [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] coming [[G2064]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] clouds [[G3507]] of heaven.” [[G3772]] 
65 At this, [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] tore [[G1284]] his [[G846]] garments [[G2440]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “He has blasphemed! [[G987]] Why [[G5101]] do we [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] any more [[G2089]] witnesses? [[G3144]] Look, [[G2400]] now [[G3568]] you have heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] blasphemy. [[G988]] 
66 What [[G5101]] {do} you [[G4771]] think?” [[G1380]] “He deserves [[G1777]] to die,” [[G2288]] they answered. [[G611]] 
67 Then [[G5119]] they spat [[G1716]] in [[G1519]] His [[G846]] face [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] struck [[G2852]] Him. [[G846]] Others [[G3588]] slapped [Him], [[G4474]] 
68 [and] said, [[G3004]] “Prophesy [[G4395]] to us, [[G1473]] Christ! [[G5547]] Who [[G5101]] hit [[G3817]] You?” [[G4771]] 
69 Meanwhile, [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] was sitting [[G2521]] out [[G1854]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] courtyard, [[G833]] and [[G2532]] a [[G1520]] servant girl [[G3814]] came up [[G4334]] to him. [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] were [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] Galilean,” [[G1057]] she said. [[G3004]] 
70 But [[G1161]] he denied [it] [[G720]] before [[G1715]] [them] all: [[G3956]] “I do not know [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] you are talking about.” [[G3004]] 
71 When [[G1161]] [Peter] had gone out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] gateway, [[G4440]] another [servant girl] [[G243]] saw [[G3708]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] to the people [[G3588]] there, [[G1563]] “This [man] [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth.” [[G3480]] 
72 And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] he denied [it] [[G720]] with [[G3326]] an oath: [[G3727]] “I do not know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] man!” [[G444]] 
73 After [[G3326]] a little while, [[G3398]] those [[G3588]] standing nearby [[G2476]] came up [[G4334]] to Peter. [[G4074]] “Surely [[G230]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] one of [[G1537]] them,” [[G846]] they said, [[G2036]] “for [[G1063]] your [[G4771]] accent [[G2981]] gives [[G4160]] you [[G4771]] away.” [[G1212]] 
74 At that, [[G5119]] he began [[G756]] to curse [[G2653]] and [[G2532]] swear [to them], [[G3660]] “I do not know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] man!” [[G444]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] a rooster [[G220]] crowed. [[G5455]] 
75 Then [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] remembered [[G3403]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] Jesus [[G2424]] had spoken: [[G2046]] “Before [[G4250]] [the] rooster [[G220]] crows, [[G5455]] you will deny [[G533]] Me [[G1473]] three times.” [[G5151]] And [[G2532]] he went [[G1831]] outside [[G1854]] [and] wept [[G2799]] bitterly.
