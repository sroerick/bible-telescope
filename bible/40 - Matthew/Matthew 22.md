# Matthew 22
[[Matthew 21|←]] • [[Matthew 23|→]]
1 [Once] [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] Jesus [[G2424]] spoke [[G611]] to them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] parables: [[G3850]] 
2 “The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is like [[G3666]] a king [[G935]] who [[G3748]] prepared [[G4160]] a wedding banquet [[G1062]] for [[G3588]] his [[G846]] son. [[G5207]] 
3 He sent [[G649]] his [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] to call [[G2564]] those [[G3588]] he had invited [[G2564]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] banquet, [[G1062]] but [[G2532]] they refused [[G2309]] to come. [[G2064]] 
4 Again, [[G3825]] he sent [[G649]] other [[G243]] servants [[G1401]] [and] said, [[G3004]] ‘Tell [[G2036]] those who [[G3588]] have been invited [[G2564]] that [[G2400]] I have prepared [[G2090]] my [[G1473]] dinner. [[G712]] My [[G1473]] oxen [[G5022]] and [[G2532]] fatlings [[G4619]] have been killed, [[G2380]] and [[G2532]] everything [is] [[G3956]] ready. [[G2092]] Come [[G1205]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wedding banquet. [[G1062]] 
5 But [[G1161]] they paid no attention [[G272]] [and] went away, [[G565]] one [[G3739]] to [[G1519]] his [[G2398]] field, [[G68]] and [[G1161]] another [[G3739]] to [[G1909]] his [[G846]] business. [[G1711]] 
6 The [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] seized [[G2902]] his [[G846]] servants, [[G1401]] mistreated [them], [[G5195]] and [[G2532]] killed [them]. [[G615]] 
7 The [[G3588]] king [[G935]] was enraged. [[G3710]] He sent [[G3992]] his [[G846]] troops [[G4753]] to destroy [[G622]] those [[G1565]] murderers [[G5406]] and [[G2532]] burn [[G1714]] their [[G846]] city. [[G4172]] 
8 Then [[G5119]] he said [[G3004]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] servants, [[G1401]] ‘The [[G3588]] wedding banquet [[G1062]] is [[G1510]] ready, [[G2092]] but [[G1161]] those [[G3588]] I invited [[G2564]] were [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy. [[G514]] 
9 Go [[G4198]] therefore [[G3767]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] crossroads [[G1327]] and [[G2532]] invite [[G2564]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] banquet [[G1062]] as many as [[G3745]] you can find.’ [[G2147]] 
10 So [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] servants [[G1401]] went out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] streets [[G3598]] [and] gathered [[G4863]] everyone [[G3956]] they could find, [[G2147]] both [[G5037]] evil [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] good, [[G18]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wedding hall [[G1062]] was filled [[G4130]] with guests. [[G345]] 
11 But when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] came in [[G1525]] to see [[G2300]] the [[G3588]] guests, [[G345]] he spotted [[G3708]] a man [[G444]] [who was] not [[G3756]] dressed [[G1746]] in wedding [[G1062]] clothes. [[G1742]] 
12 ‘Friend,’ [[G2083]] he asked, [[G3004]] ‘how [[G4459]] did you get in [[G1525]] here [[G5602]] without [[G2192]] wedding [[G1062]] clothes?’ [[G1742]] But [[G1161]] [the man] was speechless. [[G5392]] 
13 Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] told [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] servants, [[G1249]] ‘Tie [[G1210]] him [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] foot [[G4228]] [and] throw him outside [[G1544]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] outer [[G1857]] darkness, [[G4655]] [where] there [[G1563]] will be [[G1510]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of [[G3588]] teeth. [[G3599]] 
14 For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] are [[G1510]] called, [[G2822]] but [[G1161]] few [are] [[G3641]] chosen.” [[G1588]] 
15 Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] went out [[G4198]] [and] plotted [[G2983]] to trap [[G3802]] [Jesus] [[G846]] in [[G1722]] His words. [[G3056]] 
16 They sent [[G649]] their [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to Him [[G846]] along with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Herodians. [[G2265]] “Teacher,” [[G1320]] they said, [[G3004]] “we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] You are [[G1510]] honest [[G227]] and [that] [[G2532]] You teach [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of God [[G2316]] in accordance with [[G1722]] the truth. [[G225]] You [[G4771]] defer [[G3199]] to [[G4012]] no one, [[G3762]] because [[G1063]] You pay no attention [[G991]] to [[G1519]] external appearance. [[G4383]] 
17 So [[G3767]] tell [[G2036]] us [[G1473]] what [[G5101]] You [[G4771]] think. [[G1380]] Is it lawful [[G1832]] to pay [[G1325]] taxes [[G2778]] to Caesar, [[G2541]] or [[G2228]] not?” [[G3756]] 
18 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] was aware [[G1097]] of their [[G846]] evil motives. [[G4189]] “You hypocrites!” [[G5273]] He said. [[G2036]] “Why [[G5101]] are you testing [[G3985]] Me? [[G1473]] 
19 Show [[G1925]] Me [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] coin [[G3546]] used for [[G3588]] the tax.” [[G2778]] And [[G1161]] they brought [[G4374]] Him [[G846]] a denarius. [[G1220]] 
20 “Whose [[G5101]] likeness [[G1504]] [is] this,” [[G3778]] He asked, [[G3004]] “and [[G2532]] whose [[G3588]] inscription?” [[G1923]] 
21 “Caesar’s,” [[G2541]] they answered. [[G3004]] So [[G3767]] [Jesus] told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Give [[G591]] to Caesar [[G2541]] what [is] [[G3588]] Caesar’s, [[G2541]] and [[G2532]] to God [[G2316]] what [is] [[G3588]] God’s.” [[G2316]] 
22 And [[G2532]] when they heard [this], [[G191]] they were amazed. [[G2296]] So [[G2532]] they left [[G863]] Him [[G846]] [and] went away. [[G565]] 
23 That [[G1565]] [same] [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] [the] Sadducees, [[G4523]] who say [[G3004]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3361]] resurrection, [[G386]] came [[G4334]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] questioned [[G1905]] Him. [[G846]] 
24 “Teacher,” [[G1320]] they said, [[G3004]] “Moses [[G3475]] declared that [[G2036]] if [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] dies [[G599]] without [[G3361]] having [[G2192]] children, [[G5043]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] is to marry [[G1918]] the [[G3588]] widow [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] raise up [[G450]] offspring [[G4690]] for [[G3588]] [him]. [[G80]] 
25 Now [[G1161]] there were [[G1510]] seven [[G2033]] brothers [[G80]] among [[G3844]] us. [[G1473]] The [[G3588]] first [one] [[G4413]] married [[G1060]] and [[G2532]] died [[G5053]] without [[G3361]] having [[G2192]] children. [[G4690]] [So] he left [[G863]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] brother. [[G80]] 
26 The same thing happened to [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] and [[G2532]] third [brothers], [[G5154]] down to [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] seventh. [[G2033]] 
27 And [[G1161]] last [[G5305]] of all, [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] died. [[G599]] 
28 In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection, [[G386]] then, [[G3767]] whose [[G5101]] wife [[G1135]] will she be [[G1510]] of the [[G3588]] seven? [[G2033]] For [[G1063]] all of them [[G3956]] were married [[G2192]] to her.” [[G846]] 
29 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “You are mistaken [because] [[G4105]] you do not know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures [[G1124]] or [[G3366]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of God. [[G2316]] 
30 In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection, [[G386]] [people] will neither marry [[G1060]] nor [[G3777]] be given in marriage. [[G1061]] Instead, [[G235]] they will be [[G1510]] like [[G5613]] [the] angels [[G32]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
31 But [[G1161]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] of the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] have you not read [[G314]] what [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] said [[G2046]] to you: [[G4771]] 
32 ‘I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Jacob?’ [[G2384]] He is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [the] dead, [[G3498]] but [[G235]] of [the] living.” [[G2198]] 
33 When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] heard [this], [[G191]] they were astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] His [[G846]] teaching. [[G1322]] 
34 And [when] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] had silenced [[G5392]] the [[G3588]] Sadducees, [[G4523]] they themselves gathered [[G4863]] together. [[G1909]] 
35 One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] an expert in the law, [[G3544]] tested [[G3985]] Him [[G846]] with a question: [[G1905]] 
36 “Teacher, [[G1320]] which [[G4169]] commandment [[G1785]] [is the] greatest [[G3173]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law?” [[G3551]] 
37 [Jesus] declared, [[G5346]] “‘Love [[G25]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] God [[G2316]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] heart [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] soul [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] mind.’ [[G1271]] 
38 This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] greatest [[G3173]] commandment. [[G1785]] 
39 And [[G1161]] [the] second [[G1208]] [is] like [[G3664]] it: [[G846]] ‘Love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] neighbor [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] yourself.’ [[G4572]] 
40 All [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Prophets [[G4396]] depend [[G2910]] on [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] two [[G1417]] commandments.” [[G1785]] 
41 While [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] were assembled, [[G4863]] Jesus [[G2424]] questioned [[G1905]] them: [[G846]] 
42 “What [[G5101]] {do} you [[G4771]] think [[G1380]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Christ? [[G5547]] Whose [[G5101]] son [[G5207]] is He?” [[G1510]] “David’s,” [[G1138]] they answered. [[G3004]] 
43 [Jesus] said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “How [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] {does} David [[G1138]] in [[G1722]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] call [[G2564]] Him [[G846]] Lord? [[G2962]] [For] he says: [[G3004]] 
44 ‘The Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] Lord, [[G2962]] “Sit [[G2521]] at [[G1537]] My [[G1473]] right hand, [[G1188]] until [[G2193]] I put [[G5087]] Your [[G4771]] enemies [[G2190]] under [[G5270]] Your [[G4771]] feet.”’ [[G4228]] 
45 So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] David [[G1138]] calls [[G2564]] Him [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G4459]] can He be [[G1510]] [David’s] [[G846]] son?” [[G5207]] 
46 No one [[G3762]] was able [[G1410]] to answer [[G611]] a word, [[G3056]] [and] [[G3761]] from [[G575]] that [[G1565]] day [on] [[G2250]] [no one] [[G5100]] dared [[G5111]] to question [[G1905]] Him [[G846]] [any] further. [[G3765]]
