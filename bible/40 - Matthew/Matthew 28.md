# Matthew 28
[[Matthew 27|←]] • [[Mark 1|→]]
1 After [[G3796]] [the] Sabbath, [[G4521]] at dawn [[G2020]] on [[G1519]] [the] first [day] [[G1520]] of [the] week, [[G4521]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] Mary [[G3137]] went [[G2064]] to see [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] tomb. [[G5028]] 
2 Suddenly [[G2400]] there was [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] earthquake, [[G4578]] for [[G1063]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] descended [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] rolled away [[G617]] the [[G3588]] stone, [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] sat [[G2521]] on [[G1883]] it. [[G846]] 
3 His [[G846]] appearance [[G2397]] was [[G1510]] like [[G5613]] lightning, [[G796]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] clothing [[G1742]] white [[G3022]] as [[G5613]] snow. [[G5510]] 
4 The [[G3588]] guards [[G5083]] trembled [[G4579]] in [[G575]] fear [[G5401]] of him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] became [[G1096]] like [[G5613]] dead [men]. [[G3498]] 
5 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] women, [[G1135]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid, [[G5399]] for [[G1063]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] are looking for [[G2212]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] was crucified. [[G4717]] 
6 He is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] here; [[G5602]] He has risen, [[G1453]] just as [[G2531]] He said! [[G2036]] Come, [[G1205]] see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] He lay. [[G2749]] 
7 Then [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] quickly [[G5035]] [and] tell [[G2036]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] ‘He has risen [[G1453]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] is going ahead of [[G4254]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]] There [[G1563]] you will see [[G3708]] Him.’ [[G846]] See, [[G2400]] I have told [[G2036]] you. [[G4771]] 
8 So [[G2532]] they hurried away [[G565]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] in [[G3326]] fear [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] joy, [[G5479]] [and] ran [[G5143]] to tell [[G518]] His [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]] 
9 Suddenly [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] met [[G5221]] them [[G846]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Greetings!” [[G5463]] They came to [Him], [[G4334]] grasped [[G2902]] His [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] worshiped [[G4352]] Him. [[G846]] 
10 “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid,” [[G5399]] said [[G3004]] Jesus. [[G2424]] “Go, [[G5217]] tell [[G518]] My [[G1473]] brothers [[G80]] to [[G2443]] go [[G565]] to [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]] There [[G2546]] they will see [[G3708]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
11 While [[G1161]] [the women] [[G846]] were on their way, [[G4198]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] guards [[G2892]] went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] [and] reported [[G518]] to the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] all [[G537]] that [[G3588]] had happened. [[G1096]] 
12 After [[G2532]] [the chief priests] had met [[G4863]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G5037]] formed a plan, [[G2983]] they gave [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] a large [[G2425]] sum of money [[G694]] 
13 [and] instructed them: [[G3004]] “You are to say, [[G2036]] ‘His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G2064]] by night [[G3571]] [and] stole [[G2813]] His [body] [[G846]] {while} we [[G1473]] were asleep.’ [[G2837]] 
14 If [[G1437]] this [report] [[G3778]] reaches [[G191]] the [[G3588]] governor, [[G2232]] we [[G1473]] will satisfy [[G3982]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] keep [[G4160]] you [[G4771]] out of trouble.” [[G275]] 
15 So [[G1161]] the [guards] [[G3588]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] money [[G694]] [and] did [[G4160]] as [[G5613]] they were instructed. [[G1321]] And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] account [[G3056]] has been circulated [[G1310]] among [[G3844]] [the] Jews [[G2453]] to [[G3360]] this [[G3588]] very [[G4594]] day. [[G2250]] 
16 Meanwhile, [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] eleven [[G1733]] disciples [[G3101]] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] Jesus [[G2424]] had designated. [[G5021]] 
17 When [[G2532]] they saw [[G3708]] Him, [[G846]] they worshiped Him, [[G4352]] but [[G1161]] some [[G3588]] doubted. [[G1365]] 
18 Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] came to [[G4334]] them [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2980]] “All [[G3956]] authority [[G1849]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] has been given [[G1325]] to Me. [[G1473]] 
19 Therefore [[G3767]] go [and] [[G4198]] make disciples of [[G3100]] all [[G3956]] nations, [[G1484]] baptizing [[G907]] them [[G846]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] 
20 [and] teaching [[G1321]] them [[G846]] to obey [[G5083]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] I have commanded [[G1781]] you. [[G4771]] And [[G2532]] surely [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] always, [[G3956]] to [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] very end [[G4930]] of the [[G3588]] age.” [[G165]]
