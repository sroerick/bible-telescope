# Matthew 27
[[Matthew 26|←]] • [[Matthew 28|→]]
1 When [[G1161]] morning [[G4405]] came, [[G1096]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] of the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] conspired [[G4824]] against [[G2596]] Jesus [[G2424]] to [[G5620]] put Him to death. [[G2289]] 
2 They bound [[G1210]] Him, [[G846]] led [Him] away, [[G520]] and [[G2532]] handed [Him] over to [[G3860]] Pilate [[G4091]] the [[G3588]] governor. [[G2232]] 
3 When [[G5119]] Judas, [[G2455]] who [[G3588]] had betrayed Him, [[G3860]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] was condemned, [[G2632]] he was filled with remorse [[G3338]] [and] returned [[G4762]] the [[G3588]] thirty [[G5144]] pieces of silver [[G694]] to the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders. [[G4245]] 
4 “I have sinned [[G264]] by betraying [[G3860]] innocent [[G121]] blood,” [[G129]] he said. [[G3004]] “What [is that] [[G5101]] to [[G4314]] us?” [[G1473]] they replied. [[G2036]] “You [[G4771]] bear the responsibility.” [[G3708]] 
5 So [[G2532]] [Judas] threw [[G4496]] the [[G3588]] silver [[G694]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] and left. [[G402]] Then he went away [[G565]] and [[G2532]] hanged himself. [[G519]] 
6 The [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] picked up [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] pieces of silver [[G694]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “It is unlawful [[G1832]] to put [[G906]] this [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] treasury, [[G2878]] since [[G1893]] it is [[G1510]] blood [[G129]] money.” [[G5092]] 
7 [After] [[G1161]] conferring together, [[G2983]] [they used] [[G1537]] [the money] [[G846]] to buy [[G59]] the [[G3588]] potter’s [[G2763]] field [[G68]] as [[G1519]] a burial place [[G5027]] for [[G3588]] foreigners. [[G3581]] 
8 That is why [[G1352]] [it] [[G68]] has been called [[G2564]] the Field [[G68]] of Blood [[G129]] to [[G2193]] this day. [[G4594]] 
9 Then [[G5119]] what [[G3588]] was spoken [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] Jeremiah [[G2408]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] was fulfilled: [[G4137]] “They took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] thirty [[G5144]] pieces of silver, [[G694]] the [[G3588]] price [[G5092]] set on Him [[G3588]] by [[G575]] [the] people [[G5207]] of Israel, [[G2474]] 
10 and [[G2532]] they gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] potter’s [[G2763]] field, [[G68]] as [[G2505]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] had commanded [[G4929]] me.” [[G1473]] 
11 Meanwhile [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] governor, [[G2232]] who [[G3588]] questioned [[G1905]] Him: [[G846]] “Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews?” [[G2453]] “You [[G4771]] have said [so],” [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered. [[G5346]] 
12 And [[G2532]] when He was accused [[G2723]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] He gave no answer. [[G611]] 
13 Then [[G5119]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked [[G3004]] Him, [[G846]] “Do You not hear [[G191]] how many [[G4214]] charges they are bringing against [[G2649]] You?” [[G4771]] 
14 But [[G2532]] [Jesus] gave no answer, [[G611]] not even [[G3761]] to [[G4314]] a single [[G1520]] charge, [[G4487]] much [[G3029]] to [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] governor’s [[G2232]] amazement. [[G2296]] 
15 Now [[G1161]] [it was] the [[G3588]] governor’s [[G2232]] custom [[G1486]] at [[G2596]] [the] feast [[G1859]] to release [[G630]] to the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] a [[G1520]] prisoner [[G1198]] of [[G3739]] their choosing. [[G2309]] 
16 At that time [[G5119]] they were holding [[G2192]] a notorious [[G1978]] prisoner [[G1198]] named [[G3004]] Barabbas. [[G912]] 
17 So [[G3767]] when [the crowd] had assembled, [[G4863]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Which [one] [[G5101]] do you want [[G2309]] me to release [[G630]] to you: [[G4771]] Barabbas, [[G912]] or [[G2228]] Jesus [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] is called [[G3004]] Christ?” [[G5547]] 
18 For [[G1063]] he knew [[G1492]] [it was] [[G3754]] out of [[G1223]] envy [that] [[G5355]] they had handed [Jesus] over. [[G3860]] 
19 [While] [[G1161]] [Pilate] was sitting [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat, [[G968]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] sent [[G649]] him [[G846]] this message: [[G3004]] “Have nothing to do with [[G3367]] that [[G1565]] innocent [man], [[G1342]] for [[G1063]] I have suffered [[G3958]] terribly [[G4183]] in [[G2596]] a dream [[G3677]] today [[G4594]] because of [[G1223]] Him. [[G846]] 
20 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] persuaded [[G3982]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] to [[G2443]] ask for [[G154]] Barabbas [[G912]] and [[G1161]] to have Jesus put to death. [[G622]] 
21 “Which [[G5101]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] do you want [[G2309]] me to release [[G630]] to you?” [[G4771]] asked [[G611]] the [[G3588]] governor. [[G2232]] “Barabbas,” [[G912]] they replied. [[G2036]] 
22 “What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] should I do with [[G4160]] Jesus [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] is called [[G3004]] Christ?” [[G5547]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked. [[G3004]] They all answered, [[G3004]] “Crucify Him!” [[G4717]] 
23 “Why?” [[G1063]] asked [Pilate]. [[G5346]] “What [[G5101]] has He done [[G4160]] wrong?” [[G2556]] But [[G1161]] they shouted [[G2896]] all the louder, [[G4057]] “Crucify Him!” [[G4717]] 
24 When [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] he was accomplishing [[G5623]] nothing, [[G3762]] but that [[G235]] instead [[G3123]] a riot [[G2351]] was breaking out, [[G1096]] he took [[G2983]] water [[G5204]] [and] washed [[G633]] [his] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] before [[G561]] the [[G3588]] crowd. [[G3793]] “I am [[G1510]] innocent [[G121]] of [[G575]] this [mans] [[G3778]] blood, [[G129]] he said. [[G3004]] “You [[G4771]] shall bear the responsibility. [[G3708]] 
25 All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] answered, [[G611]] “His [[G846]] blood [[G129]] [be] on [[G1909]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] our [[G1473]] children!” [[G5043]] 
26 [So] [[G5119]] [Pilate] released [[G630]] Barabbas [[G912]] to them. [[G846]] But [[G1161]] he had Jesus flogged [[G5417]] [and] handed Him over [[G3860]] to [[G2443]] be crucified. [[G4717]] 
27 Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] governor’s [[G2232]] soldiers [[G4757]] took [[G3880]] Jesus [[G2424]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Praetorium [[G4232]] [and] gathered [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] company [[G4686]] around [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]] 
28 They stripped [[G1562]] Him [[G846]] [and] put [[G4060]] a scarlet [[G2847]] robe [[G5511]] on Him. [[G846]] 
29 And [[G2532]] they twisted together [[G4120]] a crown [[G4735]] of [[G1537]] thorns [[G173]] [and] put [it] [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] His [[G846]] head. [[G2776]] [They put] [[G2532]] a staff [[G2563]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] right hand [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] knelt down [[G1120]] before [[G1715]] Him [[G846]] to mock [[G1702]] Him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Hail, [[G5463]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews! [[G2453]] 
30 And [[G2532]] they spat [[G1716]] on [[G1519]] Him, [[G846]] [and] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] staff [[G2563]] and [[G2532]] struck [[G5180]] Him [[G846]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] head {repeatedly}. [[G2776]] 
31 After [[G2532]] they had mocked [[G1702]] Him, [[G846]] they removed [[G1562]] the [[G3588]] robe [[G5511]] and [[G2532]] put [[G1746]] His [[G846]] [own] [[G3588]] clothes [[G2440]] [back] on Him. [[G846]] Then [[G2532]] they led Him away [[G520]] to [[G1519]] crucify [Him]. [[G4717]] 
32 Along the way [[G1161]] they found [[G2147]] a man [[G444]] from Cyrene, [[G2956]] named [[G3686]] Simon, [[G4613]] [and] they forced [[G29]] him [[G3778]] to [[G2443]] carry [[G142]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
33 And [when] [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] a place [[G5117]] called [[G3004]] Golgotha, [[G1115]] which [[G3739]] means [[G1510]] The Place [[G5117]] of the Skull, [[G2898]] 
34 they offered [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] wine [[G3631]] to drink, [[G4095]] mixed [[G3396]] with [[G3326]] gall; [[G5521]] but [[G2532]] after tasting [it], [[G1089]] He refused [[G2309]] to drink [it]. [[G4095]] 
35 When [[G1161]] they had crucified [[G4717]] Him, [[G846]] they divided up [[G1266]] His [[G846]] garments [[G2440]] by casting [[G906]] lots. [[G2819]] 
36 And [[G2532]] sitting down, [[G2521]] they kept watch over [[G5083]] Him [[G846]] there. [[G1563]] 
37 Above [[G1883]] His [[G846]] head [[G2776]] they posted [[G2007]] the [[G3588]] written [[G1125]] charge [[G156]] against Him: [[G846]] This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] Jesus, [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]] 
38 Two [[G1417]] robbers [[G3027]] were crucified [[G4717]] with [[G4862]] Him, [[G846]] one [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] [His] right hand [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] [the other] [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] [His] left. [[G2176]] 
39 And [[G1161]] those who [[G3588]] passed by [[G3899]] heaped abuse on [[G987]] Him, [[G846]] shaking [[G2795]] their [[G846]] heads, [[G2776]] 
40 and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] “You who [[G3588]] are going to destroy [[G2647]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] rebuild [it] [[G3618]] in [[G1722]] three [[G5140]] days, [[G2250]] save [[G4982]] Yourself! [[G4572]] If [[G1487]] You are [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] come down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] cross! [[G4716]] 
41 Likewise, [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] mocked Him, [[G1702]] saying, [[G2036]] 
42 “He saved [[G4982]] others, [[G243]] [but] He cannot [[G1410]] save [[G4982]] Himself. [[G1438]] He is [[G1510]] [the] King [[G935]] of Israel! [[G2474]] Let Him come down [[G2597]] now [[G3568]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] cross, [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] we will believe [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]] 
43 He trusts [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] God. [[G2316]] Let [God] deliver [[G4506]] Him [[G846]] now [[G3568]] if [[G1487]] He wants Him. [[G2309]] For [[G1063]] He said, [[G2036]] ‘I am [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God.’” [[G2316]] 
44 In the same way, [[G846]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] robbers [[G3027]] who [[G3588]] were crucified [[G4957]] with [[G4862]] Him [[G846]] berated [[G3679]] Him. [[G846]] 
45 From [[G575]] [the] sixth [[G1623]] hour [[G5610]] until [[G2193]] [the] ninth [[G1766]] hour [[G5610]] darkness [[G4655]] came [[G1096]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] land. [[G1093]] 
46 About [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] ninth [[G1766]] hour, [[G5610]] Jesus [[G2424]] cried out [[G310]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] “Eli, [[G2241]] Eli, [[G2241]] lema [[G2982]] sabachthani?” [[G4518]] which [[G3778]] means, [[G1510]] “My [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] My [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] why [[G2443]] have you forsaken [[G1459]] Me?” [[G1473]] 
47 When [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of those [[G3588]] standing [[G2476]] there [[G1563]] heard this, [[G191]] they said, [[G2036]] “[He] [[G3778]] is calling [[G5455]] Elijah.” [[G2243]] 
48 One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] quickly [[G2112]] ran [[G5143]] and [[G2532]] brought [[G2983]] a sponge. [[G4699]] He filled [it] [[G4130]] with vinegar, [[G3690]] put [it] on [[G4060]] a reed, [[G2563]] and held it up for [Jesus] to drink. [[G4222]] 
49 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] others [[G3062]] said, [[G2036]] “Leave [Him] alone. [[G863]] Let us see [[G3708]] if [[G1487]] Elijah [[G2243]] comes [[G2064]] to save [[G4982]] Him.” [[G846]] 
50 When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] had cried out [[G2896]] again [[G3825]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] He yielded up [[G863]] [His] [[G3588]] spirit. [[G4151]] 
51 At that moment [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] veil [[G2665]] of the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] was torn [[G4977]] in [[G1519]] two [[G1417]] from [[G575]] top [[G509]] to [[G2193]] bottom. [[G2736]] The [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] quaked [[G4579]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rocks [[G4073]] were split. [[G4977]] 
52 The [[G3588]] tombs [[G3419]] broke open, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] [the] bodies [[G4983]] of many [[G4183]] saints [[G40]] who had fallen asleep [[G2837]] were raised. [[G1453]] 
53 After [[G3326]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] resurrection, [[G1454]] when they had come [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tombs, [[G3419]] they entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] city [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] appeared [[G1718]] to many [people]. [[G4183]] 
54 When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] and [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] guarding [[G5083]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] earthquake [[G4578]] and [[G2532]] all that [[G3588]] had happened, [[G1096]] they were terrified [[G5399]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Truly [[G230]] this [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]] 
55 And [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] women [[G1135]] were [[G1510]] there, [[G1563]] watching [[G2334]] from [[G575]] a distance. [[G3113]] [They] [[G3748]] had followed [[G190]] Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G575]] Galilee [[G1056]] to minister [[G1247]] to Him. [[G846]] 
56 Among [[G1722]] [them] [[G3739]] were [[G1510]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] Joseph, [[G2501]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of [[G3588]] Zebedee’s [[G2199]] sons. [[G5207]] 
57 When [[G1161]] it was [[G1096]] evening, [[G3798]] there came [[G2064]] a rich [[G4145]] man [[G444]] from [[G575]] Arimathea [[G707]] named [[G5122]] Joseph, [[G2501]] who [[G3739]] himself [[G846]] was a disciple [[G3100]] of Jesus. [[G2424]] 
58 He [[G3778]] went [[G4334]] to Pilate [[G4091]] to ask for [[G154]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G5119]] Pilate [[G4091]] ordered that [[G2753]] it be given to him. [[G591]] 
59 So [[G2532]] Joseph [[G2501]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] wrapped [[G1794]] it [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a clean [[G2513]] linen cloth, [[G4616]] 
60 and [[G2532]] placed [[G5087]] it [[G846]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G846]] new [[G2537]] tomb [[G3419]] that [[G3739]] he had cut [[G2998]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] rock. [[G4073]] Then [[G2532]] he rolled [[G4351]] a great [[G3173]] stone [[G3037]] across the [[G3588]] entrance [[G2374]] to the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] [and] went away. [[G565]] 
61 Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] Mary [[G3137]] were [[G1510]] sitting [[G2521]] there [[G1563]] opposite [[G561]] the [[G3588]] tomb. [[G5028]] 
62 The [[G3588]] next day, [[G1887]] the one [[G3748]] after [[G3326]] Preparation Day, [[G3904]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] assembled [[G4863]] before [[G4314]] Pilate. [[G4091]] 
63 “Sir,” [[G2962]] they said, [[G3004]] “we remember [[G3403]] that [[G3754]] while [[G2089]] He was alive [[G2198]] that [[G1565]] deceiver [[G4108]] said [[G2036]] ‘After [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] I will rise again.’ [[G1453]] 
64 So [[G3767]] give the order that [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G5028]] be secured [[G805]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day. [[G2250]] Otherwise, [[G3361]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] may come [[G2064]] [and] steal Him away [[G2813]] and [[G2532]] tell [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] He has risen [[G1453]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] dead. [[G3498]] And [[G2532]] [this] [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] deception [[G4106]] would be [[G1510]] worse [[G5501]] than the [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]] 
65 “You have [[G2192]] a guard,” [[G2892]] Pilate [[G4091]] said. [[G5346]] “Go, [[G5217]] make [the tomb as] secure [[G805]] as [[G5613]] you know [how].” [[G1492]] 
66 So [[G1161]] they went [and] [[G4198]] secured the tomb [[G805]] by sealing [[G4972]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] [and posting] [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] guard. [[G2892]]
