# Matthew 20
[[Matthew 19|←]] • [[Matthew 21|→]]
1 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] a landowner [[G3617]] who [[G3748]] went out [[G1831]] early in [[G260]] [the] morning [[G4404]] to hire [[G3409]] workers [[G2040]] for [[G1519]] his [[G846]] vineyard. [[G290]] 
2 He agreed [[G4856]] [to pay] [[G3326]] [them] [[G2040]] a denarius [[G1220]] for [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] [and] sent [[G649]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] vineyard. [[G290]] 
3 About [[G4012]] the third [[G5154]] hour [[G5610]] he went out [[G1831]] [and] saw [[G3708]] others [[G243]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplace [[G58]] without anything to do. [[G692]] 
4 ‘You [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] go [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] [my] [[G3588]] vineyard,’ [[G290]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘and [[G2532]] I will pay [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] whatever [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] right.’ [[G1342]] 
5 So [[G1161]] they went. [[G565]] He went out [[G1831]] again [[G3825]] about [[G4012]] [the] sixth [hour] [[G1623]] and [[G2532]] [the] ninth [[G1766]] hour [[G5610]] [and] did [[G4160]] the same thing. [[G5615]] 
6 About [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] eleventh [hour] [[G1734]] he went out [[G1831]] [and] found [[G2147]] still others [[G243]] standing [around]. [[G2476]] ‘Why [[G5101]] have you been standing [[G2476]] here [[G5602]] all [[G3650]] day [long] [[G2250]] doing nothing?’ [[G692]] he asked. [[G3004]] 
7 ‘Because [[G3754]] no one [[G3762]] has hired [[G3409]] us,’ [[G1473]] they answered. [[G3004]] So he told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] ‘You [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] go [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] [my] [[G3588]] vineyard.’ [[G290]] 
8 When [[G1161]] evening [[G3798]] came, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] owner [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] said [[G3004]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] foreman, [[G2012]] ‘Call [[G2564]] the [[G3588]] workers [[G2040]] and [[G2532]] pay [[G591]] them [[G846]] [their] [[G3588]] wages, [[G3408]] starting [[G756]] with [[G575]] the [[G3588]] last [ones hired] [[G2078]] and moving on [[G2193]] to the [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]] 
9 [The workers who were hired] [[G3588]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] eleventh [[G1734]] hour [[G5610]] came [and] [[G2064]] each [[G303]] received [[G2983]] a denarius. [[G1220]] 
10 So when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] original [workers] [[G4413]] came, [[G2064]] they assumed [[G3543]] they would receive [[G2983]] more. [[G4119]] But [[G2532]] each [[G303]] of them [[G846]] also [[G2532]] received [[G2983]] a denarius. [[G1220]] 
11 On receiving [their pay], [[G2983]] they began to grumble [[G1111]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] landowner. [[G3617]] 
12 ‘These [[G3778]] [men who were hired] [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] worked [[G4160]] only one [[G1520]] hour,’ [[G5610]] they said, [[G3004]] ‘and [[G2532]] you have made [[G4160]] them [[G846]] equal [[G2470]] to us [[G1473]] who [[G3588]] have borne [[G941]] the [[G3588]] burden [[G922]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scorching heat [[G2742]] of the [[G3588]] day.’ [[G2250]] 
13 But [[G1161]] he answered [[G611]] one [[G1520]] of them, [[G846]] ‘Friend, [[G2083]] I am not being unfair [[G91]] to you. [[G4771]] Did you not agree [[G4856]] with me [[G1473]] on one denarius? [[G1220]] 
14 Take [[G142]] your [[G4674]] [pay] [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] go. [[G5217]] I want [[G2309]] to give [[G1325]] this [[G3778]] last [man] [[G2078]] the same as [[G5613]] [I gave] [[G2532]] you. [[G4771]] 
15 Do I not have the right [[G1832]] to do [[G4160]] as [[G3739]] I please [[G2309]] with [[G1722]] what [is] [[G3588]] mine? [[G1699]] Or [[G2228]] are you [[G1510]] envious [[G4190]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] generous?’ [[G18]] 
16 So [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] will be [[G1510]] first, [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] [will be] last.” [[G2078]] 
17 As [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] was going up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] He took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] disciples [[G3101]] aside [[G2596]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] 
18 “Look, [[G2400]] we are going up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be betrayed [[G3860]] to the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes. [[G1122]] They will condemn [[G2632]] Him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] death [[G2288]] 
19 and [[G2532]] will deliver [[G3860]] Him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] to be mocked [[G1702]] and [[G2532]] flogged [[G3146]] and [[G2532]] crucified. [[G4717]] And [[G2532]] on the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] He will be raised [to life].” [[G1453]] 
20 Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of Zebedee’s [[G2199]] sons [[G5207]] came [[G4334]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] with [[G3326]] her [[G846]] sons [[G5207]] [and] knelt down [[G4352]] to make a request [[G154]] of [[G575]] Him. [[G846]] 
21 “What [[G5101]] do you want?” [[G2309]] He asked. [[G2036]] She answered, [[G3004]] “Declare [[G2036]] that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] Your [[G4771]] kingdom [[G932]] one [[G1520]] of these [[G3778]] two [[G1417]] sons [[G5207]] of mine [[G1473]] will sit [[G2523]] at [[G1537]] Your [[G4771]] right hand, [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] [the other] [[G1520]] at [[G1537]] Your [[G4771]] left.” [[G2176]] 
22 “You do not know [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] you are asking,” [[G154]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G611]] “Are you able [[G1410]] to drink [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] I [[G1473]] am going [[G3195]] to drink?” [[G4095]] “We are able,” [[G1410]] [the brothers] answered. [[G3004]] 
23 “You will indeed drink [[G4095]] My [[G1473]] cup,” [[G4221]] [Jesus] said. [[G3004]] “But [[G1161]] to sit [[G2523]] at [[G1537]] My [[G1473]] right [[G1188]] [or] [[G2532]] left [[G2176]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] Mine [[G1699]] to grant. [[G1325]] [These seats belong] [[G235]] to those for whom [[G3739]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] has prepared them.” [[G2090]] 
24 When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ten [[G1176]] heard about [this], [[G191]] they were indignant [[G23]] with [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] brothers. [[G80]] 
25 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] called them aside [[G4341]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “You know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] of the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] lord it over [[G2634]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [their] [[G3588]] superiors [[G3173]] exercise authority over [[G2715]] them. [[G846]] 
26 It shall not be [[G1510]] this way [[G3779]] among [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] Instead, [[G235]] whoever [[G3739]] wants [[G2309]] to become [[G1096]] great [[G3173]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] must be [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] servant, [[G1249]] 
27 and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3739]] wants [[G2309]] to be [[G1510]] first [[G4413]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] must be [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] slave— [[G1401]] 
28 just as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] did not come [[G2064]] to be served, [[G1247]] but [[G235]] to serve, [[G1247]] and [[G2532]] to give [[G1325]] His [[G846]] life [[G5590]] [as] a ransom [[G3083]] for [[G473]] many.” [[G4183]] 
29 [As] they [[G846]] were leaving [[G1607]] Jericho, [[G2410]] a large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]] 
30 And [[G2532]] there were [[G2400]] two [[G1417]] blind [men] [[G5185]] sitting [[G2521]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] roadside. [[G3598]] When they heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] was passing by, [[G3855]] they shouted, [[G2896]] “Lord, [[G2962]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] us!” [[G1473]] 
31 The [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] chided [[G2008]] them [[G846]] to be silent, [[G4623]] but [[G1161]] they shouted [[G2896]] all the louder, [[G3173]] “Lord, [[G2962]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] us!” [[G1473]] 
32 Jesus [[G2424]] stopped [[G2476]] [and] called [[G5455]] them. [[G846]] “What [[G5101]] do you want [[G2309]] Me to do [[G4160]] for you?” [[G4771]] He asked. [[G2036]] 
33 “Lord,” [[G2962]] they answered, [[G3004]] “let [[G2443]] our [[G1473]] eyes [[G3788]] be opened.” [[G455]] 
34 Moved with compassion, [[G4697]] Jesus [[G2424]] touched [[G680]] their [[G846]] eyes, [[G3659]] and [[G2532]] at once [[G2112]] they received their sight [[G308]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]]
