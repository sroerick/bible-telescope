12 After [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] exile [[G3350]] to Babylon: [[G897]] Jeconiah [[G2423]] was the father of [[G1080]] Shealtiel, [[G4528]] Shealtiel [[G4528]] the father of [[G1080]] Zerubbabel, [[G2216]] 
13 Zerubbabel [[G2216]] the father of [[G1080]] Abiud, [[G10]] Abiud [[G10]] the father of [[G1080]] Eliakim, [[G1662]] and [[G1161]] Eliakim [[G1662]] the father of [[G1080]] Azor. [[G107]] 
14 Azor [[G107]] was the father of [[G1080]] Zadok, [[G4524]] Zadok [[G4524]] the father of [[G1080]] Achim, [[G885]] and [[G1161]] Achim [[G885]] the father of [[G1080]] Eliud. [[G1664]]

16 and [[G1161]] Jacob [[G2384]] the father of [[G1080]] Joseph, [[G2501]] the [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] of Mary, [[G3137]] of [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] was born [[G1080]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] is called [[G3004]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
17 In all, [[G3956]] then, [[G3767]] [there were] fourteen [[G1180]] generations [[G1074]] from [[G575]] Abraham [[G11]] to [[G2193]] David, [[G1138]] fourteen [[G1180]] from [[G575]] David [[G1138]] to [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] exile [[G3350]] to Babylon, [[G897]] and [[G2532]] fourteen [[G1180]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] exile [[G3350]] to [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
18 This is how [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] birth [[G1078]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] came about: [[G1510]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] Mary [[G3137]] was pledged in marriage [[G3423]] to Joseph, [[G2501]] but [[G2228]] before [[G4250]] they [[G846]] came together, [[G4905]] she was found [[G2147]] to be with Child [[G2192]] through [[G1537]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
19 [Because] Joseph [[G2501]] her [[G846]] husband, [[G435]] a righteous man, [[G1342]] was unwilling [[G2309]] to disgrace her publicly, [[G1165]] he resolved [[G1014]] to divorce [[G630]] her [[G846]] quietly. [[G2977]] 
20 But [[G1161]] after [[G846]] he had pondered [[G1760]] these things, [[G3778]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] appeared [[G5316]] to him [[G846]] in [[G2596]] a dream [[G3677]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Joseph, [[G2501]] son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] do not be afraid [[G5399]] to take [[G3880]] Mary [[G3137]] [as] [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] wife, [[G1135]] for [[G1063]] the [One] [[G3588]] conceived [[G1080]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] is [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
21 She will give birth to [[G5088]] a Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] you shall give [[G2564]] Him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] Jesus, [[G2424]] because [[G1063]] He [[G846]] will save [[G4982]] His [[G846]] people [[G2992]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] sins.” [[G266]] 
22 All [[G3650]] this [[G3778]] took place [[G1096]] to [[G2443]] fulfill [[G4137]] what [[G3588]] the Lord [[G2962]] had said [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet: [[G4396]] 
23 “Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] virgin [[G3933]] will be with child [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] will give birth to [[G5088]] a son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] they will call [[G2564]] Him [[G846]] Immanuel” [[G1694]] (which [[G3739]] means, [[G1510]] “God [[G2316]] with [[G3326]] us”). [[G1473]] 
24 When [[G1161]] Joseph [[G2501]] woke up, [[G1453]] he did [[G4160]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] had commanded [[G4367]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] embraced [[G3880]] [Mary as] [[G3588]] his [[G846]] wife. [[G1135]] 
25 [But] [[G2532]] he had no union with [[G1097]] her [[G846]] until [[G2193]] she gave birth to [[G5088]] a Son. [[G5207]] And [[G2532]] he gave Him the name [[G2564]] Jesus. [[G2424]]
