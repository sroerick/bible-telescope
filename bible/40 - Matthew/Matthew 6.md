# Matthew 6
[[Matthew 5|←]] • [[Matthew 7|→]]
1 Be careful [[G4337]] not [[G3361]] to perform [[G4160]] your [[G4771]] righteous acts [[G1343]] before [[G1715]] men [[G444]] to be seen [[G2300]] by them. [[G846]] If [[G1487]] [you do], [[G1161]] you will have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] reward [[G3408]] from [[G3844]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
2 So [[G3767]] when [[G3752]] you give to the needy, [[G4160]] do not sound a trumpet [[G4537]] before [[G1715]] you, [[G4771]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] hypocrites [[G5273]] do [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] streets, [[G4505]] to [[G3704]] be praised [[G1392]] by [[G5259]] men. [[G444]] Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] they already have [[G568]] their [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]] 
3 But [when] [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] give to the needy, [[G4160]] {do} not {let} [[G3361]] your [[G4771]] left [hand] [[G710]] know [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] your [[G4771]] right hand [[G1188]] is doing, [[G4160]] 
4 so that [[G3704]] your [[G4771]] giving [[G1654]] may be [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] secret. [[G2927]] And [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] who sees [[G991]] what is done [[G3588]] in secret, [[G2927]] will reward [[G591]] you. [[G4771]] 
5 And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] you pray, [[G4336]] do not be [[G1510]] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] hypocrites. [[G5273]] For [[G3754]] they love [[G5368]] to pray [[G4336]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] street [[G4113]] corners [[G1137]] to be seen [[G5316]] by men. [[G444]] Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] they already have [[G568]] their [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]] 
6 But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] you pray, [[G4336]] go [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] inner room, [[G5009]] shut [[G2808]] your [[G4771]] door, [[G2374]] [and] pray [[G4336]] to [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] who [is] [[G3588]] unseen. [[G2927]] And [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] sees [[G991]] what is done [[G3588]] in secret, [[G2927]] will reward [[G591]] you. [[G4771]] 
7 And [[G1161]] [when] you pray, [[G4336]] do not babble on [[G945]] like [[G5618]] pagans, [[G1482]] for [[G1063]] they think [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] by [[G1722]] their [[G846]] many words [[G4180]] they will be heard. [[G1522]] 
8 [Do] not [[G3361]] be like [[G3666]] them, [[G846]] for [[G1063]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] knows [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] you [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] before [[G4253]] you [[G4771]] ask [[G154]] Him. [[G846]] 
9 So then, [[G3767]] this is how [[G3779]] you [[G4771]] should pray: [[G4336]] ‘Our [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] hallowed be [[G37]] Your [[G4771]] name, [[G3686]] 
10 Your [[G4771]] kingdom [[G932]] come, [[G2064]] Your [[G4771]] will [[G2307]] be done, [[G1096]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] as [it is] [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
11 Give [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] this day [[G4594]] our [[G1473]] daily [[G1967]] bread. [[G740]] 
12 And [[G2532]] forgive [[G863]] us [[G1473]] our [[G1473]] debts, [[G3783]] as [[G5613]] we [[G1473]] also [[G2532]] have forgiven [[G863]] our [[G1473]] debtors. [[G3781]] 
13 And [[G2532]] lead [[G1533]] us [[G1473]] not [[G3361]] into [[G1519]] temptation, [[G3986]] but [[G235]] deliver [[G4506]] us [[G1473]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] evil [one].’ [[G4190]] 
14 For [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] you forgive [[G863]] men [[G444]] their [[G846]] trespasses, [[G3900]] your [[G4771]] Heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] will also forgive [[G863]] you. [[G4771]] 
15 But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] you do not forgive [[G863]] men [[G444]] their [[G846]] trespasses, [[G3900]] neither [[G3761]] {will} [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] forgive [[G863]] yours. [[G4771]] 
16 When [[G3752]] you fast, [[G3522]] [do] not [[G3361]] be [[G1096]] somber [[G4659]] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] hypocrites, [[G5273]] for [[G1063]] they disfigure [[G853]] their [[G846]] faces [[G4383]] to show [[G5316]] men [[G444]] they are fasting. [[G3522]] Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] they already have [[G568]] their [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]] 
17 But [[G1161]] [when] you [[G4771]] fast, [[G3522]] anoint [[G218]] your [[G4771]] head [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] wash [[G3538]] your [[G4771]] face, [[G4383]] 
18 so that [[G3704]] [your] fasting [[G3522]] will not be obvious [[G5316]] to men, [[G444]] but only [[G235]] to [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] who [is] [[G3588]] unseen. [[G2927]] And [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] sees [[G991]] what is done [[G3588]] in secret, [[G2927]] will reward [[G591]] you. [[G4771]] 
19 [Do] not [[G3361]] store up [[G2343]] for yourselves [[G4771]] treasures [[G2344]] on [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] where [[G3699]] moth [[G4597]] and [[G2532]] rust [[G1035]] destroy, [[G853]] and [[G2532]] where [[G3699]] thieves [[G2812]] break in [[G1358]] and [[G2532]] steal. [[G2813]] 
20 But [[G1161]] store up [[G2343]] for yourselves [[G4771]] treasures [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] where [[G3699]] moth [[G4597]] [and] [[G3777]] rust [[G1035]] do not destroy, [[G853]] and [[G2532]] where [[G3699]] thieves [[G2812]] do not break in [[G1358]] [and] steal. [[G2813]] 
21 For [[G1063]] where [[G3699]] your [[G4771]] treasure [[G2344]] is, [[G1510]] there [[G1563]] your [[G4771]] heart [[G2588]] will be [[G1510]] also. [[G2532]] 
22 The [[G3588]] eye [[G3788]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] lamp [[G3088]] of the [[G3588]] body. [[G4983]] If [[G1437]] your [[G4771]] vision [[G3788]] is [[G1510]] clear, [[G573]] your [[G4771]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] will be [[G1510]] full of light. [[G5460]] 
23 But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] your [[G4771]] vision [[G3788]] is [[G1510]] poor, [[G4190]] your [[G4771]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] will be [[G1510]] full of darkness. [[G4652]] If [[G1487]] then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] within [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] is [[G1510]] darkness, [[G4655]] how great [is] [[G4214]] that [[G3588]] darkness! [[G4655]] 
24 No one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] serve [[G1398]] two [[G1417]] masters: [[G2962]] Either [[G2228]] he will hate [[G3404]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] other, [[G2087]] or [[G2228]] he will be devoted to [[G472]] [the] one [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] despise [[G2706]] the [[G3588]] other. [[G2087]] You cannot [[G1410]] serve [both] [[G1398]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] money. [[G3126]] 
25 Therefore [[G1223]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] [do] not [[G3361]] worry about [[G3309]] your [[G4771]] life, [[G5590]] what [[G5101]] you will eat [[G5315]] or [[G2228]] drink; [[G4095]] or [[G3366]] [about] your [[G4771]] body, [[G4983]] what [[G5101]] you will wear. [[G1746]] Is [[G1510]] not [[G3780]] life [[G5590]] more [[G4119]] than [[G3588]] food, [[G5160]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] [more] than [[G3588]] clothes? [[G1742]] 
26 Look [[G1689]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G4071]] of the [[G3588]] air: [[G3772]] They do not sow [[G4687]] [or] [[G3761]] reap [[G2325]] [or] [[G3761]] gather [[G4863]] into [[G1519]] barns— [[G596]] and yet [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] Heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] feeds [[G5142]] them. [[G846]] {Are} you [[G4771]] not [[G3756]] much [[G3123]] more valuable [[G1308]] than they? [[G846]] 
27 Who [[G5101]] of you [[G4771]] by [[G1537]] worrying [[G3309]] can [[G1410]] add [[G4369]] a single [[G1520]] hour [[G4083]] to [[G1909]] his [[G846]] lifespan? [[G2244]] 
28 And [[G2532]] why [[G5101]] do you worry [[G3309]] about [[G4012]] clothes? [[G1742]] Consider [[G2648]] how [[G4459]] the [[G3588]] lilies [[G2918]] of the [[G3588]] field [[G68]] grow: [[G837]] [They do] not [[G3756]] labor [[G2872]] [or] [[G3761]] spin. [[G3514]] 
29 Yet [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] not even [[G3761]] Solomon [[G4672]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] was adorned [[G4016]] like [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] of these. [[G3778]] 
30 If [[G1487]] that is how [[G3779]] God [[G2316]] clothes [[G294]] the [[G3588]] grass [[G5528]] of the [[G3588]] field, [[G68]] which is [here] [[G1510]] today [[G4594]] and [[G2532]] tomorrow [[G839]] [is] thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the furnace, [[G2823]] [will He] not [[G3756]] much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] [clothe] you, [[G4771]] O [you] of little faith? [[G3640]] 
31 Therefore [[G3767]] [do] not [[G3361]] worry, [[G3309]] saying, [[G3004]] ‘What [[G5101]] shall we eat?’ [[G5315]] or [[G2228]] ‘What [[G5101]] shall we drink?’ [[G4095]] or [[G2228]] ‘What [[G5101]] shall we wear?’ [[G4016]] 
32 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] pagans [[G1484]] strive after [[G1934]] all [[G3956]] these things, [[G3778]] [and] [[G1063]] your [[G4771]] Heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] knows [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you need [[G5535]] them. [[G3778]] 
33 But [[G1161]] seek [[G2212]] first [[G4412]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G3778]] will be added [[G4369]] unto you. [[G4771]] 
34 Therefore [[G3767]] [do] not [[G3361]] worry [[G3309]] about [[G1519]] tomorrow, [[G839]] for [[G1063]] tomorrow [[G839]] will worry about [[G3309]] itself. [[G1438]] Today [[G2250]] [has] enough [[G713]] trouble [[G2549]] of its own. [[G846]]
