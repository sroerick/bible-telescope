[[Matthew 1|←]] • [[Matthew 3|→]]
1 After [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] was born [[G1080]] in [[G1722]] Bethlehem [[G965]] in Judea, [[G2449]] during [[G1722]] [the] time [[G2250]] of King [[G935]] Herod, [[G2264]] Magi [[G3097]] from [the] [[G575]] east [[G395]] arrived [[G3854]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] 
2 asking, [[G3004]] “Where [[G4226]] is [[G1510]] the [One who] [[G3588]] has been born [[G5088]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews? [[G2453]] We saw [[G3708]] His [[G846]] star [[G792]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] east [[G395]] and [[G2532]] have come [[G2064]] to worship [[G4352]] Him.” [[G846]] 
3 When [[G1161]] King [[G935]] Herod [[G2264]] heard [this], [[G191]] he was disturbed, [[G5015]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]] 
4 When [[G2532]] he had assembled [[G4863]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] of the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] he inquired [[G4441]] where [[G4226]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] was to be born. [[G1080]] 
5 “In [[G1722]] Bethlehem [[G965]] in Judea,” [[G2449]] they replied, [[G2036]] “for [[G1063]] this is what [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] has written: [[G1125]] 
6 ‘[But] [[G2532]] you, [[G4771]] Bethlehem, [[G965]] [in the] land [[G1093]] of Judah, [[G2448]] are [[G1510]] by no means [[G3760]] least [[G1646]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G2232]] of Judah, [[G2448]] for [[G1063]] out [[G1537]] of you [[G4771]] will come [[G1831]] a ruler [[G2233]] who [[G3748]] will be the shepherd [[G4165]] of My [[G1473]] people [[G2992]] Israel. [[G2474]] 
7 Then [[G5119]] Herod [[G2264]] called [[G2564]] the [[G3588]] Magi [[G3097]] secretly [[G2977]] [and] learned [[G198]] from [[G3844]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] {exact} time [[G5550]] the [[G3588]] star [[G792]] had appeared. [[G5316]] 
8 And [[G2532]] sending [[G3992]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Bethlehem, [[G965]] he said: [[G2036]] “Go, [[G4198]] search [[G1833]] carefully [[G199]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Child, [[G3813]] and [[G1161]] when [[G1875]] you find [Him], [[G2147]] report [[G518]] to me, [[G1473]] so that [[G3704]] I too [[G2504]] may go [[G2064]] [and] worship [[G4352]] Him. [[G846]] 
9 After [[G1161]] they had heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] king, [[G935]] they went on their way, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] star [[G792]] they had seen [[G3708]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] east [[G395]] went ahead of [[G4254]] them [[G846]] until [[G2193]] it stood [[G2476]] over [[G1883]] the place where [[G3757]] the [[G3588]] Child [[G3813]] was. [[G1510]] 
10 When [[G1161]] they saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] star, [[G792]] they rejoiced [[G5463]] with great delight. [[G5479]] 
11 [On] [[G2532]] coming [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] they saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Child [[G3813]] with [[G3326]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] Mary, [[G3137]] and [[G2532]] they fell down [[G4098]] [and] worshiped [[G4352]] Him. [[G846]] Then [[G2532]] they opened [[G455]] their [[G846]] treasures [[G2344]] [and] presented [[G4374]] Him [[G846]] with gifts [[G1435]] [of] gold [[G5557]] and [[G2532]] frankincense [[G3030]] and [[G2532]] myrrh. [[G4666]] 
12 And [[G2532]] having been warned [[G5537]] in [[G2596]] a dream [[G3677]] not [[G3361]] to return [[G344]] to [[G4314]] Herod, [[G2264]] they withdrew [[G402]] to [[G1519]] their [[G846]] country [[G5561]] by [[G1223]] another [[G243]] route. [[G3598]] 
13 When [[G1161]] they [[G846]] had gone, [[G402]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] appeared [[G5316]] to Joseph [[G2501]] in [[G2596]] a dream. [[G3677]] “Get up!” [[G1453]] he said. [[G3004]] “Take [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] Child [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] flee [[G5343]] to [[G1519]] Egypt. [[G125]] Stay [[G1510]] there [[G1563]] until [[G2193]] I tell [[G2036]] you, [[G4771]] for [[G1063]] Herod [[G2264]] is going [[G3195]] to search for [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] Child [[G3813]] to kill [[G622]] Him.” [[G846]] 
14 So [[G1161]] he got up, [[G1453]] took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] Child [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] by night, [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] withdrew [[G402]] to [[G1519]] Egypt, [[G125]] 
15 where [[G1563]] he stayed [[G1510]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] death [[G5054]] of Herod. [[G2264]] This [[G2443]] fulfilled [[G4137]] what [[G3588]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] had spoken [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet: [[G4396]] “Out [[G1537]] of Egypt [[G125]] I called [[G2564]] My [[G1473]] Son.” [[G5207]] 
16 When [[G5119]] Herod [[G2264]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] he had been outwitted [[G1702]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Magi, [[G3097]] he was filled with rage. [[G2373]] Sending orders, [[G649]] he put to death [[G337]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] boys [[G3816]] in [[G1722]] Bethlehem [[G965]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] vicinity [[G3725]] [who were] [[G575]] two years old [[G1332]] and [[G2532]] under, [[G2736]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] he had learned [[G198]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Magi. [[G3097]] 
17 Then [[G5119]] what was [[G3588]] spoken [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Jeremiah [[G2408]] was fulfilled: [[G4137]] 
18 “A voice [[G5456]] is heard [[G191]] in [[G1722]] Ramah, [[G4471]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] mourning, [[G3602]] Rachel [[G4478]] weeping [for] [[G2799]] her [[G846]] children, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] refusing [[G2309]] consolation, [[G3870]] because [[G3754]] they are [[G1510]] no more.” [[G3756]] 
19 After [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] died, [[G5053]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] appeared [[G5316]] in [[G2596]] a dream [[G3677]] to [[G3588]] Joseph [[G2501]] in [[G1722]] Egypt. [[G125]] 
20 “Get up!” [[G1453]] he said. [[G3004]] “Take [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] Child [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] [the] land [[G1093]] of Israel, [[G2474]] for [[G1063]] those [[G3588]] seeking [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] Child’s [[G3813]] life [[G5590]] are now dead.” [[G2348]] 
21 So [[G1161]] [Joseph] got up, [[G1453]] took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] Child [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] went [[G1525]] to [[G1519]] [the] land [[G1093]] of Israel. [[G2474]] 
22 But [[G1161]] when he learned [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Archelaus [[G745]] was reigning in [[G936]] Judea [[G2449]] in place of [[G473]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Herod, [[G2264]] he was afraid [[G5399]] to go [[G565]] there. [[G1563]] Having been warned [[G5537]] in [[G2596]] a dream, [[G3677]] he withdrew [[G402]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] district [[G3313]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] 
23 and [[G2532]] he went [[G2064]] [and] lived [[G2730]] in [[G1519]] a town [[G4172]] called [[G3004]] Nazareth. [[G3478]] So [[G3704]] was fulfilled [[G4137]] what [[G3588]] was spoken [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophets: [[G4396]] “He will be called [[G2564]] a Nazarene.” [[G3480]]
