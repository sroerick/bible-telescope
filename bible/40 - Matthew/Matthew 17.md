# Matthew 17
[[Matthew 16|←]] • [[Matthew 18|→]]
1 After [[G3326]] six [[G1803]] days [[G2250]] Jesus [[G2424]] took with [Him] [[G3880]] Peter, [[G4074]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] of [James], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] led them up [[G399]] a high [[G5308]] mountain [[G3735]] by [[G2596]] themselves. [[G2398]] 
2 [There] [[G2532]] He was transfigured [[G3339]] before [[G1715]] them. [[G846]] His [[G846]] face [[G4383]] shone [[G2989]] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sun, [[G2246]] and [[G1161]] His [[G846]] clothes [[G2440]] became [[G1096]] as white [[G3022]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] light. [[G5457]] 
3 Suddenly [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] Elijah [[G2243]] appeared [[G3708]] before them, [[G846]] talking [[G4814]] with [[G3326]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
4 Peter [[G4074]] said [[G2036]] to Jesus, [[G2424]] “Lord, [[G2962]] it is [[G1510]] good [[G2570]] for us [[G1473]] to be [[G1510]] here. [[G5602]] If [[G1487]] You wish, [[G2309]] I will put up [[G4160]] three [[G5140]] shelters: [[G4633]] one [[G1520]] for You, [[G4771]] one [[G1520]] for Moses, [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] for Elijah.” [[G2243]] 
5 While [[G2089]] [Peter] [[G846]] was {still} speaking, [[G2980]] a bright [[G5460]] cloud [[G3507]] enveloped [[G1982]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] cloud [[G3507]] said, [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] Son, [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] I am well pleased. [[G2106]] Listen [[G191]] to Him! [[G846]] 
6 When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [this], [[G191]] they fell [[G4098]] facedown [[G1909]] in terror. [[G5399]] 
7 Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] came over [[G4334]] and [[G2532]] touched [[G680]] them. [[G846]] “Get up,” [[G1453]] He said. [[G2036]] “Do not be afraid.” [[G5399]] 
8 And when [[G1161]] they looked up, [[G1869]] they saw [[G3708]] no one [[G3762]] but [[G1487]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
9 As [[G2532]] they [[G846]] were coming down [[G2597]] the [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] Jesus [[G2424]] instructed [[G1781]] them, [[G846]] “Do not tell anyone [[G2036]] [about this] [[G3588]] vision [[G3705]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] has been raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead.” [[G3498]] 
10 The [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G1905]] Him, [[G846]] “Why [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] {do} the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] Elijah [[G2243]] must [[G1163]] come [[G2064]] first?” [[G4412]] 
11 [Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “Elijah [[G2243]] {does} indeed [[G3303]] come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] he will restore [[G600]] all things. [[G3956]] 
12 But [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] Elijah [[G2243]] {has} already [[G2235]] come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] they did not recognize [[G1921]] him, [[G846]] but [[G235]] have done [[G4160]] to [[G1722]] him [[G846]] whatever [[G3745]] they wished. [[G2309]] In the same way, [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will [[G3195]] suffer [[G3958]] at their hands. [[G5259]] 
13 Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] understood [[G4920]] that [[G3754]] He was speaking [[G2036]] to them [[G846]] about [[G4012]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist. [[G910]] 
14 When [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] a man [[G444]] came up [[G4334]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] [and] knelt before [[G1120]] Him. [[G846]] 
15 “Lord, [[G2962]] have mercy on [[G1653]] my [[G1473]] son,” [[G5207]] he said. [[G3004]] “He has seizures [[G4583]] and [[G2532]] is suffering [[G3958]] terribly. [[G2560]] He often falls [[G4098]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] [or] [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] water. [[G5204]] 
16 I brought [[G4374]] him [[G846]] to [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] disciples, [[G3101]] but [[G2532]] they could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] heal [[G2323]] him.” [[G846]] 
17 “O [[G5599]] unbelieving [[G571]] and [[G2532]] perverse [[G1294]] generation!” [[G1074]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G611]] “How long [[G2193]] must I remain [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you? [[G4771]] How long [[G2193]] must I put up with [[G430]] you? [[G4771]] Bring [[G5342]] [the boy] [[G846]] here [[G5602]] to Me.” [[G1473]] 
18 Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] rebuked [[G2008]] [the demon], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [it] [[G1140]] came out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] [the boy], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [he] [[G3816]] was healed [[G2323]] from [[G575]] that [[G1565]] moment. [[G5610]] 
19 Afterward [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to Jesus [[G2424]] privately [[G2398]] [and] asked, [[G2036]] “Why [[G1223]] couldn’t [[G1410]] we [[G1473]] drive it out?” [[G1544]] 
20 “Because [[G1223]] you [[G4771]] [have] so little faith,” [[G3640]] He answered. [[G3004]] “For [[G1063]] truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] if [[G1437]] you have [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] the size of [[G5613]] a mustard [[G4615]] seed, [[G2848]] you can say [[G2046]] to this [[G3778]] mountain, [[G3735]] ‘Move [[G3327]] from here [[G1759]] to there,’ [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] it will move. [[G3327]] Nothing [[G3762]] will be impossible [[G101]] for you.” [[G4771]] 
21 But [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] kind [[G1085]] does not go out, [[G1607]] except [[G1487]] by [[G1722]] prayer [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] fasting. [[G3521]] 
22 When [[G1161]] they [[G846]] gathered together [[G4962]] in [[G1722]] Galilee, [[G1056]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] is going [[G3195]] to be betrayed [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] [the] hands [[G5495]] of men. [[G444]] 
23 They will kill [[G615]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] on the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] He will be raised [to life].” [[G1453]] And [[G2532]] [the disciples] were deeply grieved. [[G3076]] 
24 After [[G1161]] they [[G846]] had arrived [[G2064]] in [[G1519]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] the [[G3588]] collectors [[G2983]] of the [[G3588]] two-drachma [tax] [[G1323]] came [[G4334]] to Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] asked, [[G2036]] “{Does} your [[G4771]] Teacher [[G1320]] pay [[G5055]] the [[G3588]] two drachmas?” [[G1323]] 
25 “Yes,” [[G3483]] he answered. [[G3004]] When [[G2532]] [Peter] entered [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] Jesus [[G2424]] preempted [[G4399]] him. [[G846]] “What [[G5101]] do you think, [[G1380]] Simon?” [[G4613]] He asked. [[G3004]] “From [[G575]] whom [[G5101]] {do} the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] collect [[G2983]] customs [[G5056]] [and] [[G2228]] taxes: [[G2778]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] [own] [[G3588]] sons, [[G5207]] or [[G2228]] from [[G575]] others?” [[G245]] 
26 “From [[G575]] others,” [[G245]] [Peter] answered. [[G2036]] “Then [[G686]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] are [[G1510]] exempt,” [[G1658]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared. [[G5346]] 
27 “But [[G1161]] so that [[G2443]] we may not offend [[G4624]] them, [[G846]] go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] the sea, [[G2281]] cast [[G906]] a hook, [[G44]] and [[G2532]] take [[G142]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4412]] fish [[G2486]] you catch. [[G305]] When [[G2532]] you open [[G455]] its [[G846]] mouth, [[G4750]] you will find [[G2147]] a four-drachma coin. [[G4715]] Take [it] [[G2983]] [and] [[G1565]] give [it] [[G1325]] to them [[G846]] for [[G473]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] Me. [[G1473]]
