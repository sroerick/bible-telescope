# Matthew 16
[[Matthew 15|←]] • [[Matthew 17|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] Sadducees [[G4523]] came [[G4334]] [and] tested [Jesus] [[G3985]] by asking [[G1905]] Him [[G846]] to show [[G1925]] them [[G846]] a sign [[G4592]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
2 But [[G1161]] He replied, [[G611]] “When evening [[G3798]] comes, [[G1096]] you say, [[G3004]] ‘The weather [will be] fair, [[G2105]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] is red;’ [[G4449]] 
3 and [[G2532]] in the morning, [[G4404]] ‘Today [[G4594]] [it will be] stormy, [[G5494]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] is red [[G4449]] [and] overcast.’ [[G4768]] You know [how] [[G1097]] to interpret [[G1252]] the [[G3588]] appearance [[G4383]] of the [[G3588]] sky, [[G3772]] but [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] signs [[G4592]] of the [[G3588]] times! [[G2540]] 
4 [A] wicked [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] adulterous [[G3428]] generation [[G1074]] demands [[G1934]] a sign, [[G4592]] but [[G2532]] none [[G3756]] will be given [[G1325]] it [[G846]] except [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] of Jonah.” [[G2495]] Then [[G2532]] He left [[G2641]] them [[G846]] [and] went away. [[G565]] 
5 When [[G2532]] they crossed [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side, [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] forgot [[G1950]] to take [[G2983]] bread. [[G740]] 
6 “Watch out!” [[G3708]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] them. [[G846]] “Beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] yeast [[G2219]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] Sadducees.” [[G4523]] 
7 They discussed this [[G1260]] among [[G1722]] themselves [[G1438]] [and] concluded, [[G3004]] “[It is] because [[G3754]] we did not bring [[G2983]] [any] bread.” [[G740]] 
8 Aware [of their conversation], [[G1097]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “[You] of little faith, [[G3640]] why [[G5101]] are you talking [[G1260]] among [[G1722]] yourselves [[G1438]] about [[G3754]] having [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] bread? [[G740]] 
9 Do you still not understand? [[G3539]] Do you not remember [[G3421]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] for the [[G3588]] five thousand, [[G4000]] and [[G2532]] how many [[G4214]] basketfuls [[G2894]] you gathered? [[G2983]] 
10 [Or] [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] loaves [[G740]] for the [[G3588]] four thousand, [[G5070]] and [[G2532]] how many [[G4214]] basketfuls [[G4711]] you gathered? [[G2983]] 
11 How [[G4459]] can you not understand [[G3539]] that [[G3754]] I was not telling you [[G2036]] about [[G4012]] bread? [[G740]] But [[G1161]] beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] yeast [[G2219]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] Sadducees.” [[G4523]] 
12 Then [[G5119]] they understood [[G4920]] that [[G3754]] He was not telling [them] [[G2036]] to beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] yeast [[G2219]] used in [[G3588]] bread, [[G740]] but [[G235]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] teaching [[G1322]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] Sadducees. [[G4523]] 
13 When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] region [[G3313]] of Caesarea [[G2542]] Philippi, [[G5376]] He questioned [[G2065]] His [[G846]] disciples: [[G3101]] “Who [[G5101]] {do} people [[G444]] say [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] Man [[G444]] is?” [[G1510]] 
14 They replied, [[G2036]] “Some [[G3588]] [say] [[G3303]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist; [[G910]] others [say] [[G243]] Elijah; [[G2243]] and still [[G1161]] others, [[G2087]] Jeremiah [[G2408]] or [[G2228]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] prophets.” [[G4396]] 
15 “But [what about] [[G1161]] you?” [[G4771]] Jesus asked. [[G3004]] “Who [[G5101]] do you say [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am?” [[G1510]] 
16 Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] answered, [[G611]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] God.” [[G2316]] 
17 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Blessed [[G3107]] are you, [[G1510]] Simon [[G4613]] son of Jonah! [[G920]] For [this] [[G3754]] was not revealed [[G601]] to you [[G4771]] {by} flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood, [[G129]] but [by] [[G235]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
18 And [[G1161]] I [[G2504]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] this [[G3778]] rock [[G4073]] I will build [[G3618]] My [[G1473]] church, [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] [the] gates [[G4439]] of Hades [[G86]] will not prevail against [[G2729]] it. [[G846]] 
19 I will give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] keys [[G2807]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]] Whatever [[G3739]] you bind [[G1210]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] will be [[G1510]] bound [[G1210]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] whatever [[G3739]] you loose [[G3089]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] will be [[G1510]] loosed [[G3089]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
20 Then [[G5119]] He admonished [[G1291]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] not to tell anyone [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] He [[G846]] was [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
21 From [[G575]] that time [on] [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] began [[G756]] to show [[G1166]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] that [[G3754]] He must [[G1163]] go [[G565]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] suffer [[G3958]] many things [[G4183]] at the hands of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] chief priests, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] that He must be killed [[G615]] and [[G2532]] on the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] be raised to life. [[G1453]] 
22 Peter [[G4074]] took Him aside [[G4355]] [and] began [[G756]] to rebuke [[G2008]] Him. [[G846]] “Far be it [[G2436]] from You, [[G4771]] Lord!” [[G2962]] he said. [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] {shall} never [[G3756]] happen [[G1510]] to You!” [[G4771]] 
23 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] turned [[G4762]] [and] said [[G2036]] to Peter, [[G4074]] “Get [[G5217]] behind [[G3694]] Me, [[G1473]] Satan! [[G4567]] You are [[G1510]] a stumbling block [[G4625]] to Me. [[G1473]] For [[G3754]] you do not have in mind [[G5426]] the things [[G3588]] of God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] things [[G3588]] of men.” [[G444]] 
24 Then [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] would [[G2309]] come [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] Me, [[G1473]] he must deny [[G533]] himself [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] his [[G846]] cross [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G190]] Me. [[G1473]] 
25 For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3739]] wants [[G2309]] to save [[G4982]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] will lose [[G622]] it, [[G846]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3739]] loses [[G622]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for My sake [[G1752]] will find [[G2147]] it. [[G846]] 
26 What [[G5101]] will it profit [[G5623]] a man [[G444]] if [[G1437]] he gains [[G2770]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G2889]] yet [[G1161]] forfeits [[G2210]] his [[G846]] soul? [[G5590]] Or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] {can} a man [[G444]] give [[G1325]] in exchange for [[G465]] his [[G846]] soul? [[G5590]] 
27 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] Man [[G444]] will [[G3195]] come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] Father’s [[G3962]] glory [[G1391]] with [[G3326]] His [[G846]] angels, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] He will repay [[G591]] each one [[G1538]] according to [[G2596]] what he [[G846]] has done. [[G4234]] 
28 Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] some [[G5100]] who [[G3588]] are [[G1510]] standing [[G2476]] here [[G5602]] will not taste [[G1089]] death [[G2288]] until [[G2193]] they see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] coming [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] kingdom.” [[G932]]
