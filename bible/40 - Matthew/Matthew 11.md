# Matthew 11
[[Matthew 10|←]] • [[Matthew 12|→]]
1 After [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] had finished [[G5055]] instructing [[G1299]] His [[G846]] twelve [[G1427]] disciples, [[G3101]] He went on [[G3327]] from there [[G1564]] to teach [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] preach [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] [the nearby] [[G846]] towns. [[G4172]] 
2 Meanwhile, [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] heard [[G191]] in [[G1722]] prison [[G1201]] [about] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] [and] he sent [[G3992]] two [[G1223]] of his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] 
3 to ask [[G2036]] Him, [[G846]] “Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] [One who] was to come, [[G2064]] or [[G2228]] should we look for [[G4328]] someone else?” [[G2087]] 
4 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Go [back] [[G4198]] [and] report [[G518]] to John [[G2491]] what [[G3739]] you hear [[G191]] and [[G2532]] see: [[G991]] 
5 [The] blind [[G5185]] receive sight, [[G308]] [the] lame [[G5560]] walk, [[G4043]] [the] lepers [[G3015]] are cleansed, [[G2511]] [the] deaf [[G2974]] hear, [[G191]] [the] dead [[G3498]] are raised, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] good news is preached [[G2097]] [to the] poor. [[G4434]] 
6 Blessed [[G3107]] is [[G1510]] the [one who] [[G3739]] does not fall away [[G4624]] on account of [[G1722]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
7 As [John’s disciples] [[G3778]] were leaving, [[G4198]] Jesus [[G2424]] began [[G756]] to speak [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] about [[G4012]] John: [[G2491]] “What [[G5101]] did you go out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] to see? [[G2300]] A reed [[G2563]] swaying [[G4531]] in [[G5259]] [the] wind? [[G417]] 
8 What [[G5101]] then [[G235]] did you go out [[G1831]] to see? [[G3708]] A man [[G444]] dressed [[G294]] in [[G1722]] fine [clothes]? [[G3120]] Look, [[G2400]] those [[G3588]] who wear [[G5409]] fine [clothing] [[G3120]] are found [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] kings’ [[G935]] palaces. [[G3624]] 
9 What [[G5101]] then [[G235]] did you go out [[G1831]] to see? [[G3708]] A prophet? [[G4396]] Yes, [[G3483]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] more [[G4053]] than a prophet. [[G4396]] 
10 This [[G3778]] is [the one] [[G1510]] about [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] it is written: [[G1125]] ‘Behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] will send [[G649]] My [[G1473]] messenger [[G32]] ahead of You, [[G4253]] who [[G3739]] will prepare [[G2680]] Your [[G4771]] way [[G3598]] before [[G1715]] You.’ [[G4771]] 
11 Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] among [those] [[G1722]] born [[G1084]] of women [[G1135]] there has risen [[G1453]] no [[G3756]] one greater [[G3173]] than John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist. [[G910]] Yet even [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] least [[G3398]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] greater [[G3173]] than he. [[G846]] 
12 From [[G575]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G910]] until [[G2193]] now, [[G737]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] has been subject to violence, [[G971]] and [[G2532]] [the] violent [[G973]] lay claim [[G726]] to it. [[G846]] 
13 For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] prophesied [[G4395]] until [[G2193]] John. [[G2491]] 
14 And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] you are willing [[G2309]] to accept [it], [[G1209]] he [[G846]] is [[G1510]] [the] Elijah [[G2243]] who was [[G3195]] to come. [[G2064]] 
15 He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] ears, [[G3775]] let him hear. [[G191]] 
16 To what [[G5101]] can I compare [[G3666]] this [[G3778]] generation? [[G1074]] They are [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] children [[G3813]] sitting [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplaces [[G58]] and [[G3739]] calling out [[G4377]] to others: [[G2087]] 
17 ‘We played the flute [[G832]] for you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you did not dance; [[G3738]] we sang a dirge, [[G2354]] and [[G2532]] you did not mourn.’ [[G2875]] 
18 For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] came [[G2064]] neither [[G3383]] eating [[G2068]] nor [[G3383]] drinking, [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] they say, [[G3004]] ‘He has [[G2192]] a demon!’ [[G1140]] 
19 The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] came [[G2064]] eating [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinking, [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] they say, [[G3004]] ‘Look [[G2400]] [at this] [[G444]] glutton [[G5314]] and [[G2532]] drunkard, [[G3630]] a friend [[G5384]] of tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] of sinners!’ [[G268]] But [[G2532]] wisdom [[G4678]] is vindicated [[G1344]] by [[G575]] her [[G846]] actions. [[G2041]] 
20 Then [[G5119]] [Jesus] began [[G756]] to denounce [[G3679]] the [[G3588]] cities [[G4172]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] most [[G4118]] of His [[G846]] miracles [[G1411]] had taken place, [[G1096]] because [[G3754]] they did not repent. [[G3340]] 
21 “Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] Chorazin! [[G5523]] Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] Bethsaida! [[G966]] For [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] miracles [[G1411]] [that ] [[G3588]] were performed [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] had happened [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon, [[G4605]] they would have repented [[G3340]] long ago [[G3819]] in [[G1722]] sackcloth [[G4526]] and [[G2532]] ashes. [[G4700]] 
22 But [[G4133]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] it will be [[G1510]] more bearable [[G414]] for Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon [[G4605]] on [[G1722]] [the] day [[G2250]] of judgment [[G2920]] than [[G2228]] for you. [[G4771]] 
23 And [[G2532]] you, [[G4771]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] will you be lifted up [[G5312]] to [[G2193]] heaven? [[G3772]] [No], you will descend [[G2597]] to [[G2193]] Hades! [[G86]] For [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] miracles [[G1411]] [that] [[G3588]] were performed [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] had happened [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Sodom, [[G4670]] it would have remained [[G3306]] to [[G3360]] this [[G3588]] day. [[G4594]] 
24 But [[G4133]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] it will be [[G1510]] more bearable [[G414]] for Sodom [[G4670]] on [[G1722]] [the] day [[G2250]] of judgment [[G2920]] than [[G2228]] for you.” [[G4771]] 
25 At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2540]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared, [[G2036]] “I praise [[G1843]] You, [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] Lord [[G2962]] of heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth, [[G1093]] because [[G3754]] You have hidden [[G2928]] these things [[G3778]] from [[G575]] [the] wise [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] learned, [[G4908]] and [[G2532]] revealed [[G601]] them [[G846]] to little children. [[G3516]] 
26 Yes, [[G3483]] Father, [[G3962]] for [[G3754]] this [[G3779]] was [[G1096]] well-pleasing [[G2107]] in Your sight. [[G1715]] 
27 All things [[G3956]] have been entrusted [[G3860]] to Me [[G1473]] by [[G5259]] My [[G1473]] Father. [[G3962]] No one [[G3762]] knows [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] except [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] [and] [[G3761]] [no one] [[G5100]] knows [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] except [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] those to whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] chooses [[G1014]] to reveal [Him]. [[G601]] 
28 Come [[G1205]] to [[G4314]] Me, [[G1473]] all [[G3956]] you who [[G3588]] are weary [[G2872]] and [[G2532]] burdened, [[G5412]] and I [[G2504]] will give you rest. [[G373]] 
29 Take [[G142]] My [[G1473]] yoke [[G2218]] upon [[G1909]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] learn [[G3129]] from [[G575]] Me; [[G1473]] for [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] gentle [[G4239]] and [[G2532]] humble [[G5011]] [in] [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] you will find [[G2147]] rest [[G372]] [for] [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] souls. [[G5590]] 
30 For [[G1063]] My [[G1473]] yoke [[G2218]] is easy [[G5543]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] burden [[G5413]] is [[G1510]] light.” [[G1645]]
