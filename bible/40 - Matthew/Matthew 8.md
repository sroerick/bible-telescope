# Matthew 8
[[Matthew 7|←]] • [[Matthew 9|→]]
1 When [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] large [[G4183]] crowds [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]] 
2 Suddenly [[G2532]] a leper [[G3015]] came [[G4334]] [and] knelt before [[G4352]] Him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] “Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1437]] You are willing, [[G2309]] You can [[G1410]] make me clean.” [[G2511]] 
3 [Jesus] reached out [[G1614]] [His] [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] [and] touched [[G680]] [the man]. [[G846]] “I am willing,” [[G2309]] He said, [[G3004]] “be clean.” [[G2511]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] his [[G846]] leprosy [[G3014]] was cleansed. [[G2511]] 
4 Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] instructed [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “See that [[G3708]] you don’t tell anyone. [[G2036]] But [[G235]] go, [[G5217]] show [[G1166]] yourself [[G4572]] to the [[G3588]] priest [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] offer [[G4374]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1435]] prescribed [[G4367]] by Moses, [[G3475]] as [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] to them. [[G846]] 
5 When [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] had entered [[G1525]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] a centurion [[G1543]] came [[G4334]] [and] pleaded [[G3870]] with Him, [[G846]] 
6 “Lord, [[G2962]] my [[G1473]] servant [[G3816]] lies [[G906]] at [[G1722]] home, [[G3614]] paralyzed [[G3885]] [and] in terrible [[G1171]] agony.” [[G928]] 
7 “I [[G1473]] will go [[G2064]] [and] heal [[G2323]] him,” [[G846]] [Jesus] replied. [[G3004]] 
8 The [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] answered, [[G611]] “Lord, [[G2962]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] to [[G2443]] have You come [[G1525]] under [[G5259]] my [[G1473]] roof. [[G4721]] But [[G235]] just [[G3440]] say [[G2036]] the word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] servant [[G3816]] will be healed. [[G2390]] 
9 For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] myself [[G2532]] am [[G1510]] a man [[G444]] under [[G5259]] authority, [[G1849]] with [[G2192]] soldiers [[G4757]] under [[G5259]] me. [[G1683]] I tell [[G3004]] [one] [[G3778]] to go, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] he goes; [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] to come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] he comes. [[G2064]] [I tell] [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] servant [[G1401]] to do [[G4160]] something, [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] he does [it]. [[G4160]] 
10 When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [this], [[G191]] He marveled [[G2296]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] to those [[G3588]] following [Him], [[G190]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] I have not found anyone [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] Israel [[G2474]] [with] such great [[G5118]] faith. [[G4102]] 
11 I say [[G3004]] to you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] will come [[G2240]] from [[G575]] [the] east [[G395]] and [[G2532]] [the] west [[G1424]] to share the banquet [[G347]] with [[G3326]] Abraham, [[G11]] Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] Jacob [[G2384]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
12 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] will be cast [[G1544]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] outer [[G1857]] darkness, [[G4655]] [where] there [[G1563]] will be [[G1510]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of teeth.” [[G3599]] 
13 Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] centurion, [[G1543]] “Go! [[G5217]] As [[G5613]] you have believed, [[G4100]] [so] will it be done [[G1096]] for you.” [[G4771]] And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] servant [[G3816]] was healed [[G2390]] at [[G1722]] that very [[G1565]] hour. [[G5610]] 
14 When [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] arrived [[G2064]] at [[G1519]] Peter’s [[G4074]] house, [[G3614]] He saw [[G3708]] [Peter’s] [[G846]] mother-in-law [[G3994]] sick in bed [[G906]] with a fever. [[G4445]] 
15 He touched [[G680]] her [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fever [[G4446]] left [[G863]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] she got up [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] began to serve [[G1247]] them. [[G846]] 
16 When [[G1161]] evening [[G3798]] came, [[G1096]] many [[G4183]] who were demon-possessed [[G1139]] were brought [[G4374]] to [Jesus], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He drove out [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] spirits [[G4151]] with a word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] healed [[G2323]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] sick. [[G2560]] 
17 This was [[G3704]] to fulfill [[G4137]] what [[G3588]] was spoken [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Isaiah: [[G2268]] “He took on [[G2983]] our [[G1473]] infirmities, [[G769]] and [[G2532]] carried [[G941]] our [[G3588]] diseases.” [[G3554]] 
18 [When] [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] [a] large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] around [[G4012]] Him, [[G846]] He gave orders [[G2753]] to cross [[G565]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side. [[G4008]] 
19 And [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of the scribes [[G1122]] came [[G4334]] to Him [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] I will follow [[G190]] You [[G4771]] wherever [[G3699]] You go.” [[G565]] 
20 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G3004]] “Foxes [[G258]] have [[G2192]] dens, [[G5454]] and [[G2532]] birds [[G4071]] of the [[G3588]] air [have] [[G3772]] nests, [[G2682]] but [[G1161]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] has [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] [place] [[G4226]] to lay [[G2827]] [His] [[G3588]] head.” [[G2776]] 
21 Another [[G2087]] of His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] requested, [[G2036]] “Lord, [[G2962]] first [[G4412]] let [[G2010]] me [[G1473]] go [[G565]] and [[G2532]] bury [[G2290]] my [[G1473]] father.” [[G3962]] 
22 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “Follow [[G190]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] let [[G863]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] bury [[G2290]] their own [[G1438]] dead.” [[G3498]] 
23 [When] [[G2532]] He [[G846]] got into [[G1684]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]] 
24 Suddenly [[G2532]] a violent [[G3173]] storm [[G4578]] came up [[G1096]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] so that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] was engulfed [[G2572]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] waves; [[G2949]] but [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was sleeping. [[G2518]] 
25 [The disciples] went [[G4334]] [and] woke [[G1453]] Him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] “Lord, [[G2962]] save us! [[G4982]] We are perishing!” [[G622]] 
26 “[You] of little faith,” [[G3640]] [Jesus] replied, [[G3004]] “why [[G5101]] are you [[G1510]] so afraid?” [[G1169]] Then [[G5119]] He got up [[G1453]] [and] rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] it was [[G1096]] perfectly [[G3173]] calm. [[G1055]] 
27 [The] men [[G444]] were amazed [[G2296]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “What kind [of man] [[G4217]] is [[G1510]] this? [[G3778]] Even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] obey [[G5219]] Him!” [[G846]] 
28 When [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] arrived [[G2064]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side [[G4008]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] region [[G5561]] of the [[G3588]] Gadarenes, [[G1046]] two [[G1417]] demon-possessed [men] [[G1139]] met [[G5221]] Him [[G846]] on their way [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tombs. [[G3419]] [They were] so [[G3029]] violent [[G5467]] that [[G5620]] no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] could [[G2480]] pass [[G3928]] that [[G1565]] way. [[G3598]] 
29 “What [[G5101]] do You [want] [[G4771]] with us, [[G1473]] Son [[G5207]] of God?” [[G2316]] they shouted. [[G2896]] “Have You come [[G2064]] here [[G5602]] to torture [[G928]] us [[G1473]] before [the] [[G4253]] proper time?” [[G2540]] 
30 In the distance [[G3112]] a large [[G4183]] herd [[G34]] of pigs [[G5519]] was [[G1510]] feeding. [[G1006]] 
31 So [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] demons [[G1142]] begged [[G3870]] [Jesus], [[G846]] “If [[G1487]] You drive us out, [[G1544]] send us [[G649]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] herd [[G34]] of pigs.” [[G5519]] 
32 “Go!” [[G5217]] He told [[G2036]] them. [[G846]] So [[G1161]] they came out [[G1831]] and went [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] pigs, [[G5519]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] herd [[G34]] rushed [[G3729]] down [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] steep bank [[G2911]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] perished [[G599]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] waters. [[G5204]] 
33 Those [[G3588]] tending [the pigs] [[G1006]] ran off [[G5343]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] [and] reported [[G518]] all this, [[G3956]] including [[G2532]] the [account] [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] demon-possessed [men]. [[G1139]] 
34 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] town [[G4172]] went out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] meet [[G5222]] Jesus. [[G2424]] And [[G2532]] when they saw [[G3708]] Him, [[G846]] they begged [Him] [[G3870]] to leave [[G3327]] their [[G846]] region. [[G3725]]
