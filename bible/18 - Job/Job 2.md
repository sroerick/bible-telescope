1 On another [[H1961]] day, [[H3117]] the sons [[H1121]] of God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to present themselves [[H3320]] before [[H5921]] the LORD; [[H3068]] and Satan [[H7854]] also [[H1571]] came [[H935]] with them [[H8432]] to present [[H3320]] himself before [[H5921]] [Him]. [[H3068]] 
2 “Where [[H335]] have you come from?” [[H935]] said [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] Satan. [[H7854]] “From roaming [[H7751]] through the earth,” [[H776]] [he] [[H7854]] replied, [[H6030]] “and from walking back and forth [[H1980]] in it.”  
3 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Satan, [[H7854]] “Have you considered [[H7760]] My servant [[H5650]] Job? [[H347]] For [[H3588]] [there is] no one [[H369]] on earth [[H776]] like him— [[H3644]] blameless [[H8535]] and upright, [[H3477]] fearing [[H3373]] God [[H430]] and shunning [[H5493]] evil. [[H7451]] He still [[H5750]] retains [[H2388]] his integrity, [[H8538]] even though you incited Me [[H5496]] against him  to ruin him [[H1104]] without cause. [[H2600]] 
4 “Skin [[H5785]] for [[H1157]] skin!” [[H5785]] Satan [[H7854]] replied. [[H6030]] “A man [[H376]] will give up [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] he owns [[H834]] in exchange for [[H1157]] his life. [[H5315]] 
5 But [[H199]] stretch out [[H7971]] Your hand [[H3027]] and strike [[H5060]] his flesh [[H1320]] and bones, [[H6106]] and he will surely [[H518]] curse You [[H1288]] to [[H413]] Your face.” [[H6440]] 
6 “Very well,” [[H2005]] said [[H559]] the LORD [[H3069]] to Satan. [[H7854]] “He is in your hands, [[H3027]] but [[H389]] you must spare [[H8104]] his life.” [[H5315]] 
7 So Satan [[H7854]] went out [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and infected [[H5221]] Job [[H347]] with terrible [[H7451]] boils [[H7822]] from the soles [[H3709]] of his feet [[H7272]] to [[H5704]] the crown of his head. [[H6936]] 
8 And Job took [[H3947]] a piece of broken pottery [[H2789]] to scrape himself [[H1623]] as he [[H1931]] sat [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] the ashes. [[H665]] 
9 Then [Job's] wife [[H802]] said [[H559]] to him,  “Do you still [[H5750]] retain [[H2388]] your integrity? [[H8538]] Curse [[H1288]] God [[H430]] and die!” [[H4191]] 
10 “You speak [[H1696]] as a [[H259]] foolish woman [[H5036]] speaks,” [[H1696]] he told [[H559]] her. [[H413]] “Should we accept [[H6901]] from [[H853]] God [[H430]] only good [[H2896]] and not [[H3808]] adversity?” [[H7451]] In all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] Job [[H347]] did not [[H3808]] sin [[H2398]] in what he said. [[H8193]] 
11 Now when Job’s [[H347]] three [[H7969]] friends— [[H7453]] Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite, [[H8489]] Bildad [[H1085]] the Shuhite, [[H7747]] and Zophar [[H6691]] the Naamathite— [[H5284]] heard [[H8085]] about all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] adversity [[H7451]] that had come [[H935]] upon him, [[H5921]] each of them [[H376]] came [[H935]] from his home [[H4725]] and met [[H3259]] together [[H3162]] to go [[H935]] and sympathize [[H5110]] with [Job]  and comfort him. [[H5162]] 
12 When they lifted [[H5375]] up their eyes [[H5869]] from afar, [[H7350]] they could barely [[H3808]] recognize [Job]. [[H5234]] They began to weep [[H1058]] aloud, [[H5375]] and each man [[H376]] tore [[H7167]] his robe [[H4598]] and threw [[H2236]] dust [[H6083]] into the air [[H8064]] over [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]] 
13 Then they sat [[H3427]] on the ground [[H776]] with him [[H854]] for seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] and seven [[H7651]] nights, [[H3915]] but no [[H369]] one spoke [[H1696]] a word [[H1697]] to [[H413]] him because [[H3588]] they saw [[H7200]] how intense [[H3966]] his suffering [[H3511]] had become.
