2 “Dominion [[H4910]] and awe [[H6343]] belong to Him; [[H5973]] He establishes [[H6213]] harmony [[H7965]] in the heights of heaven. [[H4791]] 
3 Can His troops [[H1416]] be numbered? [[H4557]] On [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] does His light [[H216]] not [[H3808]] rise? [[H6965]] 
4 How [[H4100]] then can a man [[H582]] be just [[H6663]] before [[H5973]] God? [[H410]] How [[H4100]] can one born [[H3205]] of woman [[H802]] be pure? [[H2135]] 
5 If [[H2005]] even [[H5704]] the moon [[H3394]] does not [[H3808]] shine, [[H166]] and the stars [[H3556]] are not [[H3808]] pure [[H2141]] in His sight, [[H5869]] 
6 how much less [[H637]] man, [[H582]] who is but a maggot, [[H7415]] and the son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] who is but a worm!” [[H8438]]
