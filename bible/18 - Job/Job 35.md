# Job 35
[[Job 34|←]] • [[Job 36|→]]
1 And Elihu [[H453]] went on [[H6030]] to say: [[H559]] 
2 “Do you think [[H2803]] it [[H2063]] is just [[H4941]] when you say, [[H559]] ‘I am righteous [[H6664]] before God.’? [[H410]] 
3 For [[H3588]] you ask, [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] does it profit [[H5532]] me,  and what [[H4100]] benefit do I gain [[H3276]] apart from sin?’ [[H2403]] 
4 I [[H589]] will answer [[H7725]] you [[H4405]] and your friends [[H7453]] with you. [[H5973]] 
5 Look [[H5027]] to the heavens [[H8064]] and see; [[H7200]] gaze [[H7789]] at the clouds [[H7834]] high [[H1361]] above you. [[H4480]] 
6 If [[H518]] you sin, [[H2398]] what [[H4100]] do you accomplish [[H6466]] against Him?  If you multiply [[H7231]] your transgressions, [[H6588]] what [[H4100]] do you do [[H6213]] to Him?  
7 If [[H518]] you are righteous, [[H6663]] what [[H4100]] do you give Him, [[H5414]] or [[H176]] what [[H4100]] does He receive [[H3947]] from your hand? [[H3027]] 
8 Your wickedness [[H7562]] affects only a man [[H376]] like yourself, [[H3644]] and your righteousness [[H6666]] only a son [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]] 
9 Men cry out [[H2199]] under great [[H7230]] oppression; [[H6217]] they plead for relief [[H7768]] from the arm [[H2220]] of the mighty. [[H7227]] 
10 But no [[H3808]] one asks, [[H559]] ‘Where [is] [[H335]] God [[H433]] my Maker, [[H6213]] who gives us [[H5414]] songs [[H2158]] in the night, [[H3915]] 
11 who teaches us [[H502]] more than the beasts [[H929]] of the earth [[H776]] and makes us wiser [[H2449]] than the birds [[H5775]] of the air?’ [[H8064]] 
12 There [[H8033]] they cry out, [[H6817]] but He does not [[H3808]] answer, [[H6030]] because of [[H6440]] the pride [[H1347]] of evil men. [[H7451]] 
13 Surely [[H389]] God [[H410]] does not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to empty pleas, [[H7723]] and the Almighty [[H7706]] does not [[H3808]] take note of it. [[H7789]] 
14 How much less, [[H637]] then, when [[H3588]] you say [[H559]] that you do not [[H3808]] see Him, [[H7789]] that your case [[H1779]] is before Him [[H6440]] and you must wait [[H2342]] for Him,  
15 and further, [[H6258]] that [[H3588]] [in] His anger [[H639]] He has not punished [[H6485]] [or] [[H3808]] taken much notice [[H3045]] of folly. [[H6580]] 
16 So Job [[H347]] opens [[H6475]] his mouth [[H6310]] in vain [[H1892]] and multiplies [[H3527]] words [[H4405]] without [[H1097]] knowledge.” [[H1847]]
