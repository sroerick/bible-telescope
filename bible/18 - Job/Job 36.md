# Job 36
[[Job 35|←]] • [[Job 37|→]]
1 And Elihu [[H453]] continued [[H3254]] and said: [[H559]] 
2 “Bear [[H3803]] with me  a little longer, [[H2191]] and I will show you [[H2331]] that [[H3588]] there is more [[H5750]] to be said [[H4405]] on God’s behalf. [[H433]] 
3 I get [[H5375]] my knowledge [[H1843]] from afar, [[H7350]] and I will ascribe [[H5414]] justice [[H6664]] to my Maker. [[H6466]] 
4 For [[H3588]] truly [[H551]] my arguments [[H4405]] are free of [[H3808]] falsehood; [[H8267]] one perfect [[H8549]] in knowledge [[H1844]] is with you. [[H5973]] 
5 Indeed [[H2005]] God [is] [[H410]] mighty, [[H3524]] but He despises [[H3988]] no one; [[H3808]] [He is] mighty [[H3524]] in strength [[H3581]] of understanding. [[H3820]] 
6 He does not [[H3808]] keep the wicked [[H7563]] alive, [[H2421]] but He grants [[H5414]] justice [[H4941]] to the afflicted. [[H6041]] 
7 He does not [[H3808]] take [[H1639]] His eyes [[H5869]] off the righteous, [[H6662]] but He enthrones them [[H3678]] with [[H854]] kings [[H4428]] and exalts them [[H1361]] forever. [[H5331]] 
8 And if [[H518]] men are bound [[H631]] with chains, [[H2131]] caught [[H3920]] in cords [[H2256]] of affliction, [[H6040]] 
9 then He tells [[H5046]] them [[H1992]] their deeds [[H6467]] and how [[H3588]] arrogantly [[H1396]] they have transgressed. [[H6588]] 
10 He opens [[H1540]] their ears [[H241]] to correction [[H4148]] and commands [[H559]] that [[H3588]] they turn [[H7725]] from iniquity. [[H205]] 
11 If [[H518]] they obey [[H8085]] and serve [Him], [[H5647]] they will end [[H3615]] their days [[H3117]] in prosperity [[H2896]] and their years [[H8141]] in happiness. [[H5273]] 
12 But if [[H518]] they do not [[H3808]] obey, [[H8085]] they will perish [[H5674]] by the sword [[H7973]] and die [[H1478]] without [[H1097]] knowledge. [[H1847]] 
13 The godless [[H2611]] in heart [[H3820]] harbor [[H7760]] resentment; [[H639]] even when [[H3588]] He binds them, [[H631]] they do not [[H3808]] cry for help. [[H7768]] 
14 They [[H5315]] die [[H4191]] in their youth; [[H5290]] and their life [ends] [[H2416]] among the male cult prostitutes. [[H6945]] 
15 God rescues [[H2502]] the afflicted [[H6041]] by their affliction [[H6040]] and opens [[H1540]] their ears [[H241]] in oppression. [[H3906]] 
16 Indeed, [[H637]] He drew you [[H5496]] from the jaws [[H6310]] of distress [[H6862]] to a spacious [[H3808]] and broad place, [[H7338]] to a table [[H7979]] full [[H4390]] of richness. [[H1880]] 
17 But now you are laden [[H4390]] with the judgment [[H1779]] due the wicked; [[H7563]] judgment [[H1779]] and justice [[H4941]] have seized you. [[H8551]] 
18 Be careful [[H2534]] that no one [[H6435]] lures [[H5496]] you with riches; [[H5607]] do not [[H408]] let a large [[H7227]] bribe [[H3724]] lead you astray. [[H5186]] 
19 Can your wealth [[H7769]] or all [[H3605]] your mighty effort [[H3981]] keep [[H6186]] you from [[H3808]] distress? [[H1222]] 
20 Do not [[H408]] long for [[H7602]] the night, [[H3915]] when people [[H5971]] vanish [[H5927]] from their homes. [[H8478]] 
21 Be careful [[H8104]] not [[H408]] to turn [[H6437]] to [[H413]] iniquity, [[H205]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] you have preferred [[H977]] to affliction. [[H6040]] 
22 Behold, [[H2005]] God [[H410]] is exalted [[H7682]] in His power. [[H3581]] Who [[H4310]] is a teacher [[H3384]] like Him? [[H3644]] 
23 Who [[H4310]] has appointed [[H6485]] His way [[H1870]] for Him, [[H5921]] or [[H4310]] told Him, [[H559]] ‘You have done [[H6466]] wrong’? [[H5766]] 
24 Remember [[H2142]] to magnify [[H7679]] His work, [[H6467]] which [[H834]] men [[H376]] have praised in song. [[H7891]] 
25 All [[H3605]] mankind [[H120]] has seen it; [[H2372]] men [[H582]] behold it [[H5027]] from afar. [[H7350]] 
26 Indeed, [[H2005]] God [is] [[H410]] great— [[H7689]] beyond [[H3808]] our knowledge; [[H3045]] the number [[H4557]] of His years [[H8141]] is unsearchable. [[H3808]] 
27 For [[H3588]] He draws up [[H1639]] drops [[H5198]] of water [[H4325]] which distill [[H2212]] the rain [[H4306]] from the mist, [[H108]] 
28 which [[H834]] the clouds [[H7834]] pour out [[H5140]] and shower [[H7491]] abundantly [[H7227]] on [[H5921]] mankind. [[H120]] 
29 Furthermore, [[H637]] who can understand [[H995]] how the clouds [[H5645]] spread out, [[H4666]] how the thunder roars [[H8663]] from His pavilion? [[H5521]] 
30 See how [[H2005]] He scatters [[H6566]] His lightning [[H216]] around Him [[H5921]] and covers [[H3680]] the depths [[H8328]] of the sea. [[H3220]] 
31 For [[H3588]] by these  He judges [[H1777]] the nations [[H5971]] and provides [[H5414]] food [[H400]] in abundance. [[H4342]] 
32 He fills [[H3680]] His hands [[H3709]] with lightning [[H216]] and commands [[H6680]] it [[H5921]] to strike its mark. [[H6293]] 
33 The thunder [[H7452]] declares [[H5046]] [His presence]; [[H5921]] even the cattle [[H4735]] regard [[H5921]] the rising [storm]. [[H5927]]
