# Job 10
[[Job 9|←]] • [[Job 11|→]]
1 I loathe [[H5354]] my own [[H5315]] life; [[H2416]] I will express [[H5800]] my complaint [[H7879]] and speak [[H1696]] in the bitterness [[H4751]] of my soul. [[H5315]] 
2 I will say [[H559]] to [[H413]] God: [[H433]] ‘Do not [[H408]] condemn me! [[H7561]] Let me know [[H3045]] why [[H5921]] You prosecute me.’ [[H7378]] 
3 Does it please [[H2896]] You  to oppress me, [[H6231]] to reject [[H3988]] the work [[H3018]] of Your hands, [[H3709]] and favor [[H3313]] the schemes [[H6098]] of the wicked? [[H7563]] 
4 Do You have eyes [[H5869]] of flesh? [[H1320]] Do You see [[H7200]] as man [[H582]] sees? [[H7200]] 
5 Are Your days [[H3117]] like those [[H3117]] of a [mortal], [[H582]] or [[H518]] Your years [[H8141]] like those [[H3117]] of a man, [[H1397]] 
6 that [[H3588]] You should seek [[H1245]] my iniquity [[H5771]] and search out [[H1875]] my sin— [[H2403]] 
7 though [[H5921]] You know [[H1847]] that [[H3588]] I am not [[H3808]] guilty, [[H7561]] and there is no [[H369]] deliverance [[H5337]] from Your hand? [[H3027]] 
8 Your hands [[H3027]] shaped me [[H6087]] and altogether [[H3162]] formed me. [[H6213]] Will You now turn [[H5439]] and destroy me? [[H1104]] 
9 Please [[H4994]] remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] You molded [[H6213]] me like clay. [[H2563]] Will You now return [[H7725]] me to [[H413]] dust? [[H6083]] 
10 Did You not [[H3808]] pour me out [[H5413]] like milk, [[H2461]] and curdle [[H7087]] me like cheese? [[H1385]] 
11 You clothed [[H3847]] me with skin [[H5785]] and flesh, [[H1320]] and knit me together [[H5526]] with bones [[H6106]] and sinews. [[H1517]] 
12 You have granted [[H6213]] me [[H5978]] life [[H2416]] and loving devotion, [[H2617]] and Your care [[H6486]] has preserved [[H8104]] my spirit. [[H7307]] 
13 Yet You concealed [[H6845]] these [things] [[H428]] in Your heart, [[H3824]] and I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [was] [[H2063]] in Your [mind]: [[H5973]] 
14 If [[H518]] I sinned, [[H2398]] You would take note, [[H8104]] and would not [[H3808]] acquit me [[H5352]] of my iniquity. [[H5771]] 
15 If [[H518]] I am guilty, [[H7561]] woe [[H480]] to me!  And even if I am righteous, [[H6663]] I cannot [[H3808]] lift [[H5375]] my head. [[H7218]] [I am] full [[H7646]] of shame [[H7036]] and aware of [[H7200]] my affliction. [[H6040]] 
16 Should I hold my head high, [[H1342]] You would hunt me [[H6679]] like a lion, [[H7826]] and again [[H7725]] display Your power [[H6381]] against me.  
17 You produce new [[H2318]] witnesses [[H5707]] against me [[H5048]] and multiply [[H7235]] Your anger [[H3708]] toward me. [[H5978]] Hardships [[H6635]] assault me [[H5973]] in wave after wave. [[H2487]] 
18 Why then [[H4100]] did You bring me [[H3318]] from the womb? [[H7358]] Oh, that I had died, [[H1478]] and no [[H3808]] eye [[H5869]] had seen me! [[H7200]] 
19 If only [[H834]] I had never [[H3808]] come [[H1961]] to be, [[H1961]] but had been carried [[H2986]] from the womb [[H990]] to the grave. [[H6913]] 
20 Are my days [[H3117]] not [[H3808]] few? [[H4592]] Withdraw [[H2308]] from me, [[H4480]] that I may have a little comfort, [[H1082]] 
21 before [[H2962]] I go— [[H1980]] never [[H3808]] to return— [[H7725]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] of darkness [[H2822]] and gloom, [[H6757]] 
22 to a land [[H776]] of utter darkness, [[H5890]] of deep shadow [[H6757]] and disorder, [[H3808]] where even the light [[H3313]] is like [[H3644]] darkness.” [[H652]]
