# Job 9
[[Job 8|←]] • [[Job 10|→]]
1 Then Job [[H347]] answered: [[H6030]] 
2 “Yes, [[H551]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] [it is] so, [[H3651]] but how [[H4100]] can a mortal [[H582]] be righteous [[H6663]] before [[H5973]] God? [[H410]] 
3 If [[H518]] one wished [[H2654]] to contend [[H7378]] with [God], [[H5973]] he could not [[H3808]] answer Him [[H6030]] one [time] [[H259]] out [[H4480]] of a thousand. [[H505]] 
4 [God is] wise [[H2450]] in heart [[H3824]] and mighty [[H533]] in strength. [[H3581]] Who [[H4310]] has hardened [himself] [[H7185]] against Him [[H413]] and prospered? [[H7999]] 
5 He moves [[H6275]] mountains [[H2022]] without [[H3808]] their knowledge, [[H3045]] when [[H834]] He overturns them [[H2015]] in His anger. [[H639]] 
6 He shakes [[H7264]] the earth [[H776]] from its place, [[H4725]] so that its foundations [[H5982]] tremble. [[H6426]] 
7 He commands [[H559]] the sun [[H2775]] not [[H3808]] to shine, [[H2224]] and seals off [[H1157]] the stars. [[H3556]] 
8 He alone [[H905]] stretches out [[H5186]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and treads [[H1869]] on [[H5921]] the waves [[H1116]] of the sea. [[H3220]] 
9 He is the Maker [[H6213]] of the Bear [[H5906]] [and] Orion, [[H3685]] of the Pleiades [[H3598]] and the constellations [[H2315]] of the south. [[H8486]] 
10 He does [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] and unfathomable [things], [[H369]] wonders [[H6381]] without [[H369]] number. [[H4557]] 
11 Were He [[H2005]] to pass [[H5674]] by me, [[H5921]] I would not [[H3808]] see Him; [[H7200]] were He to move, [[H2498]] I would not [[H3808]] recognize Him. [[H995]] 
12 If [[H2005]] He snatches away, [[H2862]] who [[H4310]] can hinder Him? [[H7725]] Who [[H4310]] can say [[H559]] to Him, [[H413]] ‘What [[H4100]] are You doing?’ [[H6213]] 
13 God [[H433]] does not [[H3808]] restrain [[H7725]] His anger; [[H639]] the helpers [[H5826]] of Rahab [[H7293]] cower [[H7817]] beneath Him. [[H8478]] 
14 How [[H637]] then [[H3588]] can I [[H595]] answer Him [[H6030]] or choose [[H977]] my arguments [[H1697]] against Him? [[H5973]] 
15 For [[H834]] even if [[H518]] I were right, [[H6663]] I could not [[H3808]] answer. [[H6030]] I could only beg my Judge [[H8199]] for mercy. [[H2603]] 
16 If [[H518]] I summoned Him [[H7121]] and He answered me, [[H6030]] I do not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] He would listen [[H238]] to my voice. [[H6963]] 
17 For [[H834]] He would crush me [[H7779]] with a tempest [[H8183]] and multiply [[H7235]] my wounds [[H6482]] without cause. [[H2600]] 
18 He does not [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] me catch [[H7725]] my breath, [[H7307]] but [[H3588]] overwhelms me [[H7646]] with bitterness. [[H4472]] 
19 If [[H518]] it is a matter of strength, [[H3581]] He is indeed [[H2009]] mighty! [[H533]] If [[H518]] it is a matter of justice, [[H4941]] who [[H4310]] can summon Him? [[H3259]] 
20 Even if [[H518]] I were righteous, [[H6663]] my mouth [[H6310]] would condemn me; [[H7561]] if I [[H589]] were blameless, [[H8535]] it would declare me guilty. [[H6140]] 
21 Though I [[H589]] am blameless, [[H8535]] I have no [[H3808]] concern [[H3045]] for myself; [[H5315]] I despise [[H3988]] my life. [[H2416]] 
22 It [[H1931]] is all the same; [[H259]] that is why [[H5921]] I say, [[H559]] ‘He [[H1931]] destroys [[H3615]] both the blameless [[H8535]] and the wicked.’ [[H7563]] 
23 When [[H518]] the scourge [[H7752]] brings sudden [[H6597]] death, [[H4191]] He mocks [[H3932]] the despair [[H4531]] of the innocent. [[H5355]] 
24 The earth [[H776]] is given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked; [[H7563]] He blindfolds [[H6440]] its judges. [[H8199]] If [[H518]] it is not [He], [[H3808]] then [[H645]] who [[H4310]] [is] it? [[H1931]] 
25 My days [[H3117]] are swifter [[H7043]] than [[H4480]] a runner; [[H7323]] they flee [[H1272]] without [[H3808]] seeing [[H7200]] any good. [[H2896]] 
26 They sweep by [[H2498]] like [[H5973]] boats [[H591]] of papyrus, [[H16]] like an eagle [[H5404]] swooping down [[H2907]] on [[H5921]] its prey. [[H400]] 
27 If [[H518]] I say, [[H559]] ‘I will forget [[H7911]] my complaint, [[H7879]] I will change [[H5800]] my expression, [[H6440]] and smile,’ [[H1082]] 
28 I would still dread [[H3025]] all [[H3605]] my sufferings; [[H6094]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] You will not [[H3808]] acquit me. [[H5352]] 
29 Since I am [[H595]] already found guilty, [[H7561]] why [[H4100]] should I labor [[H3021]] in vain? [[H1892]] 
30 If [[H518]] I should wash myself [[H7364]] with snow [[H4325]] and cleanse [[H2141]] my hands [[H3709]] with lye, [[H1253]] 
31 then [[H227]] You would plunge me [[H2881]] into the pit, [[H7845]] and even my own clothes [[H8008]] would despise me! [[H8581]] 
32 For [[H3588]] He is not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] like me, [[H3644]] that I can answer Him, [[H6030]] that we can take [[H935]] each other [[H3162]] to court. [[H4941]] 
33 Nor [[H3863]] is there [[H3426]] a mediator [[H3198]] between us, [[H996]] to lay [[H7896]] his hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] us both. [[H8147]] 
34 Let Him remove [[H5493]] His rod [[H7626]] from me, [[H5921]] so that His terror [[H367]] will no [[H408]] longer frighten me. [[H1204]] 
35 Then I would speak [[H1696]] without [[H3808]] fear of Him. [[H3372]] But [[H3588]] as it is, [[H3808]] I [[H595]] am on my own. [[H5978]]
