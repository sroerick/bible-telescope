# Job 22

1 Then Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite [[H8489]] replied: [[H6030]] 
2 “Can a man [[H1397]] be of use [[H5532]] to God? [[H410]] Can even [[H3588]] a wise man [[H7919]] benefit [[H5532]] Him? [[H5921]] 
3 Does it delight [[H2656]] the Almighty [[H7706]] that [[H3588]] you are righteous? [[H6663]] Does He profit [[H1215]] if [[H3588]] your ways [[H1870]] are blameless? [[H8552]] 
4 Is it for your reverence [[H3374]] that He rebukes you [[H3198]] and enters [[H935]] into judgment [[H4941]] against you? [[H5973]] 
5 Is not [[H3808]] your wickedness [[H7451]] great? [[H7227]] Are not your iniquities [[H5771]] endless? [[H369]] 
6 For [[H3588]] you demanded security [[H2254]] from your brothers [[H251]] without cause, [[H2600]] stripping off [[H6584]] their clothes [[H899]] and leaving them naked. [[H6174]] 
7 You gave [[H8248]] no [[H3808]] water [[H4325]] to the weary [[H5889]] and withheld [[H4513]] food [[H3899]] from the famished, [[H7456]] 
8 while the land [[H776]] belonged to a mighty [[H2220]] man, [[H376]] and a man [[H5375]] of honor [[H6440]] lived [[H3427]] on it.  
9 You sent widows [[H490]] away [[H7971]] empty-handed, [[H7387]] and the strength [[H2220]] of the fatherless [[H3490]] was crushed. [[H1792]] 
10 Therefore [[H5921]] snares [[H6341]] surround you, [[H5439]] and sudden [[H6597]] peril [[H6343]] terrifies you; [[H926]] 
11 it is so dark [[H2822]] you cannot [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] and a flood [[H8229]] of water [[H4325]] covers you. [[H3680]] 
12 Is not [[H3808]] God [[H433]] as high [[H1363]] as the heavens? [[H8064]] Look at [[H7200]] the highest [[H7218]] stars, [[H3556]] how [[H3588]] lofty they are! [[H7311]] 
13 Yet you say: [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] does God [[H410]] know? [[H3045]] Does He judge [[H8199]] through [[H1157]] thick darkness? [[H6205]] 
14 Clouds [[H5645]] veil [[H5643]] Him  so that He cannot [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] as He traverses [[H1980]] heaven's [[H8064]] horizon.’ [[H2329]] 
15 Will you stay [[H8104]] on the ancient [[H5769]] path [[H734]] that [[H834]] wicked [[H205]] men [[H4962]] have trod? [[H1869]] 
16 They [[H834]] were snatched away [[H7059]] before [[H3808]] their time, [[H6256]] and their foundations [[H3247]] were swept away [[H3332]] by a river. [[H5104]] 
17 They said [[H559]] to God, [[H410]] ‘Depart [[H5493]] from us. [[H4480]] What [[H4100]] can the Almighty [[H7706]] do to us?’ [[H6466]] 
18 But it was He [[H1931]] who filled [[H4390]] their houses [[H1004]] with good things; [[H2896]] so I stay far [[H7368]] from the counsel [[H6098]] of the wicked. [[H7563]] 
19 The righteous [[H6662]] see [it] [[H7200]] and are glad; [[H8055]] the innocent [[H5355]] mock them, saying, [[H3932]] 
20 ‘Surely [[H518]] our foes [[H7009]] are destroyed, [[H3582]] and fire [[H784]] has consumed [[H398]] their excess.’ [[H3499]] 
21 Reconcile [[H5532]] now [[H4994]] and be at peace [[H7999]] with Him; [[H5973]] thereby  good [[H2896]] will come to you. [[H935]] 
22 Receive [[H3947]] instruction [[H8451]] from His mouth, [[H6310]] and lay up [[H7760]] His words [[H561]] in your heart. [[H3824]] 
23 If [[H518]] you return [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the Almighty, [[H7706]] you will be restored. [[H1129]] If you remove [[H7368]] injustice [[H5766]] from your tents [[H168]] 
24 and consign [[H7896]] your gold [[H1220]] to [[H5921]] the dust [[H6083]] and the gold of Ophir [[H211]] to the stones [[H6697]] of the ravines, [[H5158]] 
25 then the Almighty [[H7706]] will be [[H1961]] your gold [[H1220]] and the finest [[H8443]] silver [[H3701]] for you.  
26 Surely [[H3588]] then [[H227]] you will delight [[H6026]] in [[H5921]] the Almighty [[H7706]] and lift up [[H5375]] your face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] God. [[H433]] 
27 You will pray [[H6279]] to Him, [[H413]] and He will hear you, [[H8085]] and you will fulfill [[H7999]] your vows. [[H5088]] 
28 Your decisions [[H1504]] will be carried out, [[H6965]] and light [[H216]] will shine [[H5050]] on [[H5921]] your ways. [[H1870]] 
29 When [[H3588]] men are brought low [[H8213]] and you say, [[H559]] ‘Lift them up,’ [[H1466]] then He will save [[H3467]] the lowly. [[H7807]] 
30 He will deliver [even] [[H4422]] the guilty [[H336]] one, [[H5355]] who will be rescued [[H4422]] through the purity [[H1252]] of your hands.” [[H3709]]
