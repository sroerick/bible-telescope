# Job 21
[[Job 20|←]] • [[Job 22|→]]
1 Then Job [[H347]] answered: [[H6030]] 
2 “Listen [[H8085]] carefully [[H8085]] to my words; [[H4405]] let this [[H2063]] be [[H1961]] your consolation [to me]. [[H8575]] 
3 Bear with [[H5375]] me while I [[H595]] speak; [[H1696]] then after [[H310]] I have spoken, [[H1696]] you may keep mocking. [[H3932]] 
4 Is my [[H595]] complaint [[H7879]] against a man? [[H120]] Then why [[H4069]] should I not [[H3808]] be impatient? [[H7114]] 
5 Look [[H6437]] at me [[H413]] and be astonished; [[H8074]] put [[H7760]] your hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] your mouth. [[H6310]] 
6 When [[H518]] I remember, [[H2142]] terror [[H926]] takes hold, [[H270]] and my body [[H1320]] trembles in horror. [[H6427]] 
7 Why [[H4069]] do the wicked [[H7563]] live on, [[H2421]] growing old [[H6275]] and [[H1571]] increasing [[H1396]] in power? [[H2428]] 
8 Their descendants [[H2233]] are established [[H3559]] around them, [[H5973]] and their offspring [[H6631]] before their eyes. [[H5869]] 
9 Their homes [[H1004]] are safe [[H7965]] from fear; [[H6343]] the rod [[H7626]] of God [[H433]] is not [[H3808]] upon them. [[H5921]] 
10 Their bulls [[H7794]] breed [[H5674]] without [[H3808]] fail; [[H1602]] their cows [[H6510]] calve [[H6403]] and do not [[H3808]] miscarry. [[H7921]] 
11 They send forth [[H7971]] their little ones [[H5759]] like a flock; [[H6629]] their children [[H3206]] skip about, [[H7540]] 
12 singing [[H5375]] to the tambourine [[H8596]] and lyre [[H3658]] and making merry [[H8055]] at the sound [[H6963]] of the flute. [[H5748]] 
13 They spend [[H1086]] their days [[H3117]] in prosperity [[H2896]] and go down [[H5181]] to Sheol [[H7585]] in peace. [[H7281]] 
14 Yet they say [[H559]] to God: [[H410]] ‘Leave us alone! [[H5493]] For we have no [[H3808]] desire [[H2654]] to know [[H1847]] Your ways. [[H1870]] 
15 Who [[H4100]] is the Almighty, [[H7706]] that [[H3588]] we should serve Him, [[H5647]] and what [[H4100]] would we gain [[H3276]] if [[H3588]] we pray [[H6293]] to Him?’  
16 Yet [[H2005]] their prosperity [is] [[H2898]] not [[H3808]] in their own hands, [[H3027]] so I stay far [[H7368]] from the counsel [[H6098]] of the wicked. [[H7563]] 
17 How often [[H4100]] is the lamp [[H5216]] of the wicked [[H7563]] put out? [[H1846]] Does disaster [[H343]] come [[H935]] upon them? [[H5921]] Does [God,] in His anger, [[H639]] apportion [[H2505]] destruction? [[H2256]] 
18 Are [[H1961]] they like straw [[H8401]] before [[H6440]] the wind, [[H7307]] like chaff [[H4671]] swept away [[H1589]] by a storm? [[H5492]] 
19 [It is said that] God [[H433]] lays up [[H6845]] one's punishment [[H205]] for his children. [[H1121]] Let God repay the man [[H7999]] himself, [[H413]] so that he may know it. [[H3045]] 
20 Let his own eyes [[H5869]] see [[H7200]] his destruction; [[H3589]] let him drink [for himself] [[H8354]] the wrath [[H2534]] of the Almighty. [[H7706]] 
21 For [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] does he care [[H2656]] about his household [[H1004]] after him, [[H310]] when the number [[H4557]] of his months [[H2320]] has run out? [[H2686]] 
22 Can anyone teach [[H3925]] knowledge [[H1847]] to God, [[H410]] since He [[H1931]] judges [[H8199]] those on high? [[H7311]] 
23 One man [[H2088]] dies [[H4191]] full of vigor, [[H6106]] completely [[H3605]] secure [[H7946]] and at ease. [[H7961]] 
24 His body [[H5845]] is well fed, [[H4390]] and his bones [[H6106]] rich [[H8248]] with marrow. [[H4221]] 
25 Yet another man [[H2088]] dies [[H4191]] in the bitterness [[H4751]] of his soul, [[H5315]] having never [[H3808]] tasted [[H398]] prosperity. [[H2896]] 
26 But together [[H3162]] they lie down [[H7901]] in [[H5921]] the dust, [[H6083]] and worms [[H7415]] cover [[H3680]] them [both]. [[H5921]] 
27 Behold, [[H2005]] I know [[H3045]] your thoughts full well, [[H4284]] the schemes by which [[H4209]] you would wrong [[H2554]] me. [[H5921]] 
28 For [[H3588]] you say, [[H559]] ‘Where [[H346]] now is the nobleman’s [[H5081]] house, [[H1004]] and where [[H346]] are the tents [[H168]] in which the wicked [[H7563]] dwell?’ [[H4908]] 
29 Have you never [[H3808]] asked [[H7592]] those who travel [[H5674]] the roads? [[H1870]] Do you not [[H3808]] accept [[H5234]] their reports? [[H226]] 
30 Indeed, [[H3588]] the evil [[H7451]] man is spared [[H2820]] from the day [[H3117]] of calamity, [[H343]] delivered [[H2986]] from the day [[H3117]] of wrath. [[H5678]] 
31 Who [[H4310]] will denounce [[H5046]] his behavior [[H1870]] to [[H5921]] his face? [[H6440]] Who [[H4310]] will repay [[H7999]] him  for what he [[H1931]] has done? [[H6213]] 
32 He [[H1931]] is carried [[H2986]] to the grave, [[H6913]] and watch is kept [[H8245]] over [[H5921]] his tomb. [[H1430]] 
33 The clods [[H7263]] of the valley [[H5158]] are sweet [[H4985]] to him;  everyone [[H3605]] follows [[H4900]] behind him, [[H310]] and those before him [[H6440]] are without [[H369]] number. [[H4557]] 
34 So how [[H349]] can you comfort me [[H5162]] with empty words? [[H1892]] For your answers [[H8666]] remain [[H7604]] [full of] falsehood.” [[H4604]]
