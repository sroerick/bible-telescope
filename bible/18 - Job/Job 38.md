# Job 38
[[Job 37|←]] • [[Job 39|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] Job [[H347]] out of [[H4480]] the whirlwind [[H5591]] and said: [[H559]] 
2 “Who [[H4310]] is this [[H2088]] who obscures [[H2821]] My counsel [[H6098]] by words [[H4405]] without [[H1097]] knowledge? [[H1847]] 
3 Now [[H4994]] brace [[H247]] yourself [[H2504]] like a man; [[H1397]] I will question you, [[H7592]] and you shall inform Me! [[H3045]] 
4 Where [[H375]] were you [[H1961]] when I laid the foundations [[H3245]] of the earth? [[H776]] Tell [Me], [[H5046]] if [[H518]] you have understanding. [[H3045]] 
5 Who [[H4310]] fixed [[H7760]] its measurements? [[H4461]] Surely [[H3588]] you know! [[H3045]] Or [[H176]] who [[H4310]] stretched [[H5186]] a measuring line [[H6957]] across it? [[H5921]] 
6 On what [[H4100]] were its foundations [[H134]] laid, [[H2883]] or [[H176]] who [[H4310]] set [[H3384]] its core {in place}— [[H68]] 
7 while the morning [[H1242]] stars [[H3556]] sang [[H7442]] together [[H3162]] and all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of God [[H430]] shouted for joy? [[H7321]] 
8 Who enclosed [[H5526]] the sea [[H3220]] behind doors [[H1817]] when it burst forth [[H1518]] from the womb, [[H7358]] 
9 when I made [[H7760]] the clouds [[H6051]] its garment [[H3830]] and thick darkness [[H6205]] its blanket, [[H2854]] 
10 when I fixed [[H7665]] its boundaries [[H2706]] and set in place [[H7760]] its bars [[H1280]] and doors, [[H1817]] 
11 and I declared: [[H559]] ‘You may come [[H935]] this far, [[H5704]] but no [[H3808]] farther; [[H3254]] here [[H6311]] your proud [[H1347]] waves [[H1530]] must stop’? [[H7896]] 
12 In your days, [[H3117]] have you commanded [[H6680]] the morning [[H1242]] or assigned [[H3045]] the dawn [[H7837]] its place, [[H4725]] 
13 that it might spread [[H270]] to the ends [[H3671]] of the earth [[H776]] and shake [[H5287]] the wicked [[H7563]] out of it? [[H4480]] 
14 The earth takes shape [[H2015]] like clay [[H2563]] [under] a seal; [[H2368]] its hills stand out [[H3320]] like [[H3644]] the folds of a garment. [[H3830]] 
15 Light [[H216]] is withheld [[H4513]] from the wicked, [[H7563]] and their upraised [[H7311]] arm [[H2220]] is broken. [[H7665]] 
16 Have you journeyed [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the vents [[H5033]] of the sea [[H3220]] or walked [[H1980]] in the trenches [[H2714]] of the deep? [[H8415]] 
17 Have the gates [[H8179]] of death [[H4194]] been revealed [[H1540]] to you?  Have you seen [[H7200]] the gates [[H8179]] of the shadow of death? [[H6757]] 
18 Have you surveyed [[H995]] the extent [[H7338]] of the earth? [[H776]] Tell [Me], [[H5046]] if [[H518]] you know [[H3045]] all this. [[H3605]] 
19 Where [[H335]] is the way [[H1870]] to the home [[H7931]] of light? [[H216]] Do you know where [[H335]] darkness [[H2822]] resides, [[H4725]] 
20 so [[H3588]] you can lead it back [[H3947]] to [[H413]] its border? [[H1366]] Do you know [[H995]] the paths [[H5410]] to its home? [[H1004]] 
21 Surely you know, [[H3045]] for [[H3588]] you were already [[H227]] born! [[H3205]] And the number [[H4557]] of your days [[H3117]] is great! [[H7227]] 
22 Have you entered [[H935]] the storehouses [[H214]] of snow [[H7950]] or observed [[H7200]] the storehouses [[H214]] of hail, [[H1259]] 
23 which [[H834]] I hold in reserve [[H2820]] for times [[H6256]] of trouble, [[H6862]] for the day [[H3117]] of war [[H7128]] and battle? [[H4421]] 
24 In which [[H335]] direction [[H1870]] is the lightning [[H216]] dispersed, [[H2505]] or the east wind [[H6921]] scattered [[H6327]] over [[H5921]] the earth? [[H776]] 
25 Who [[H4310]] cuts [[H6385]] a channel [[H8585]] for the flood [[H7858]] or clears a path [[H1870]] for [[H2385]] the thunderbolt, [[H6963]] 
26 to bring rain [[H4305]] on [[H5921]] a barren [[H3808]] land, [[H776]] on a desert [[H4057]] where no [[H3808]] man [lives], [[H120]] 
27 to satisfy [[H7646]] the parched [[H7722]] wasteland [[H4875]] and make it sprout [[H6779]] with tender grass? [[H1877]] 
28 Does the rain [[H4306]] have [[H3426]] a father? [[H1]] Who [[H4310]] has begotten [[H3205]] the drops [[H96]] of dew? [[H2919]] 
29 From whose [[H4310]] womb [[H990]] does the ice [[H7140]] emerge? [[H3318]] Who [[H4310]] gave birth to [[H3205]] the frost [[H3713]] from heaven, [[H8064]] 
30 when the waters [[H4325]] become hard [[H2244]] as stone, [[H68]] and the surface [[H6440]] of the deep [[H8415]] is frozen? [[H3920]] 
31 Can you bind [[H7194]] the chains [[H4575]] of the Pleiades [[H3598]] or [[H176]] loosen [[H6605]] the belt [[H4189]] of Orion? [[H3685]] 
32 Can you bring forth [[H3318]] the constellations [[H4216]] in their seasons [[H6256]] or lead out [[H5148]] the Bear [[H5906]] and [[H5921]] her cubs? [[H1121]] 
33 Do you know [[H3045]] the laws [[H2708]] of the heavens? [[H8064]] Can you set [[H7760]] their dominion [[H4896]] over the earth? [[H776]] 
34 Can you command [[H7311]] the clouds [[H5645]] so that a flood [[H8229]] of water [[H4325]] covers you? [[H3680]] 
35 Can you send [[H7971]] the lightning bolts [[H1300]] on their way? [[H1980]] Do they report [[H559]] to you,  ‘Here we are’? [[H2005]] 
36 Who [[H4310]] has put [[H7896]] wisdom [[H2451]] in the heart [[H2910]] or [[H176]] given [[H5414]] understanding [[H998]] to the mind? [[H7907]] 
37 Who [[H4310]] has the wisdom [[H2451]] to count [[H5608]] the clouds? [[H7834]] Or who [[H4310]] can tilt [[H7901]] the water jars [[H5035]] of the heavens [[H8064]] 
38 when the dust [[H6083]] hardens [[H3332]] into a mass [[H4165]] and the clods of earth [[H7263]] stick together? [[H1692]] 
39 Can you hunt [[H6679]] the prey [[H2964]] for a lioness [[H3833]] or satisfy [[H4390]] the hunger [[H2416]] of young lions [[H3715]] 
40 when [[H3588]] they crouch [[H7817]] in their dens [[H4585]] and lie [[H3427]] in [[H3926]] wait [[H695]] in the thicket? [[H5521]] 
41 Who [[H4310]] provides [[H3559]] food [[H6718]] for the raven [[H6158]] when [[H3588]] its young [[H3206]] cry out [[H7768]] to [[H413]] God [[H410]] as they wander about [[H8582]] for lack of [[H1097]] food? [[H400]]
