# Job 27
[[Job 26|←]] • [[Job 28|→]]
1 Then Job [[H347]] continued [[H3254]] his discourse [[H4912]] and said: [[H559]] 
2 “As surely as God [[H410]] lives, [[H2416]] who has deprived me of [[H5493]] justice, [[H4941]] the Almighty, [[H7706]] who has embittered [[H4843]] my soul, [[H5315]] 
3 as long as my breath [[H5397]] is still [[H3605]] within me [[H5750]] and the breath [[H7307]] of God [[H433]] remains in my nostrils, [[H639]] 
4 my lips [[H8193]] will not [[H518]] speak [[H1696]] wickedness, [[H5766]] and my tongue [[H3956]] will not [[H518]] utter [[H1897]] deceit. [[H7423]] 
5 I will never [[H2486]] declare that you are right; [[H6663]] I will maintain [[H3808]] my integrity [[H8538]] until [[H5704]] I die. [[H1478]] 
6 I will hold fast [[H2388]] my righteousness [[H6666]] and never [[H3808]] let go. [[H7503]] As long as I live, [[H3117]] my conscience [[H3824]] will not [[H3808]] accuse me. [[H2778]] 
7 May my enemy [[H341]] be [[H1961]] like the wicked [[H7563]] and my opponent [[H6965]] like the unjust. [[H5767]] 
8 For [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] hope [[H8615]] has the godless [[H2611]] when [[H3588]] he is cut off, [[H1214]] when [[H3588]] God [[H433]] takes away [[H7953]] his life? [[H5315]] 
9 Will God [[H410]] hear [[H8085]] his cry [[H6818]] when [[H3588]] distress [[H6869]] comes [[H935]] upon him? [[H5921]] 
10 Will he delight [[H6026]] in [[H5921]] the Almighty? [[H7706]] Will he call upon [[H7121]] God [[H433]] at all [[H3605]] times? [[H6256]] 
11 I will instruct [[H3384]] you [[H853]] in the power [[H3027]] of God. [[H410]] I will not [[H3808]] conceal [[H3582]] the ways of [[H834]] the Almighty. [[H7706]] 
12 Surely [[H2005]] all of you [[H3605]] have seen [it] [[H2372]] for yourselves. [[H859]] Why then [[H4100]] do you keep up this [[H2088]] empty talk? [[H1892]] 
13 This [is] [[H2088]] the wicked [[H7563]] man’s [[H120]] portion [[H2506]] from [[H5973]] God— [[H410]] the heritage [[H5159]] the ruthless [[H6184]] receive [[H3947]] from the Almighty. [[H7706]] 
14 Though [[H518]] his sons [[H1121]] are many, [[H7235]] they are destined for [[H3926]] the sword; [[H2719]] and his offspring [[H6631]] will never [[H3808]] have enough [[H7646]] food. [[H3899]] 
15 His survivors [[H8300]] will be buried [[H6912]] by the plague, [[H4194]] and their widows [[H490]] will not [[H3808]] weep for them. [[H1058]] 
16 Though [[H518]] he heaps up [[H6651]] silver [[H3701]] like dust [[H6083]] and piles up [[H3559]] a wardrobe [[H4403]] like clay, [[H2563]] 
17 what he lays up, [[H3559]] the righteous [[H6662]] will wear, [[H3847]] and his silver [[H3701]] will be divided [[H2505]] by the innocent. [[H5355]] 
18 The house [[H1004]] he built [[H1129]] is like a moth’s cocoon, [[H6211]] like a hut [[H5521]] set up [[H6213]] by a watchman. [[H5341]] 
19 He lies down [[H7901]] wealthy, [[H6223]] but will do so no more; [[H3808]] when he opens [[H6491]] his eyes, [[H5869]] all is gone. [[H369]] 
20 Terrors [[H1091]] overtake [[H5381]] him like a flood; [[H4325]] a tempest [[H5492]] sweeps him away [[H1589]] in the night. [[H3915]] 
21 The east wind [[H6921]] carries him away, [[H5375]] and he is gone; [[H1980]] it sweeps him [[H8175]] out of his place. [[H4725]] 
22 It hurls [[H7993]] against him [[H5921]] without [[H3808]] mercy, [[H2550]] while he flees headlong [[H1272]] from its power. [[H3027]] 
23 It claps [[H5606]] its hands [[H3709]] at him [[H5921]] and hisses [[H8319]] him [[H5921]] out of his place. [[H4725]]
