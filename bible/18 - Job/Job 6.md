# Job 6
[[Job 5|←]] • [[Job 7|→]]
1 Then Job [[H347]] replied: [[H6030]] 
2 “If only [[H3863]] my grief [[H3708]] could be weighed [[H8254]] and  placed [[H5375]] with [[H3162]] my calamity [[H1962]] on the scales. [[H3976]] 
3 For [[H3588]] then [[H6258]] it would outweigh [[H3513]] the sand [[H2344]] of the seas— [[H3220]] no wonder [[H5921]] my words [[H1697]] have been rash. [[H3886]] 
4 For [[H3588]] the arrows [[H2671]] of the Almighty [[H7706]] have pierced me; [[H5978]] my spirit [[H7307]] drinks in [[H8354]] their poison; [[H2534]] the terrors [[H1161]] of God [[H433]] are arrayed against me. [[H6186]] 
5 Does a wild donkey [[H6501]] bray [[H5101]] over [[H5921]] fresh grass, [[H1877]] or [[H518]] an ox [[H7794]] low [[H1600]] over [[H5921]] its fodder? [[H1098]] 
6 Is tasteless food [[H8602]] eaten [[H398]] without [[H1097]] salt, [[H4417]] or [[H518]] is there [[H3426]] flavor [[H2940]] in the white [[H7388]] of an egg? [[H2495]] 
7 My soul [[H5315]] refuses [[H3985]] to touch them; [[H5060]] they are [[H1992]] loathsome [[H1741]] food to me. [[H3899]] 
8 If only [[H4310]] my request [[H7596]] were granted [[H935]] and God [[H433]] would fulfill [[H5414]] my hope: [[H8615]] 
9 that God [[H433]] would be willing [[H2974]] to crush me, [[H1792]] to unleash [[H5425]] His hand [[H3027]] and cut me off! [[H1214]] 
10 It still [[H5750]] brings [[H1961]] me comfort, [[H5165]] and joy [[H5539]] through unrelenting [[H3808]] pain, [[H2427]] that [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] denied [[H3582]] the words [[H561]] of the Holy One. [[H6918]] 
11 What [[H4100]] strength do I have, [[H3581]] that [[H3588]] I should still hope? [[H3176]] What [[H4100]] is my future, [[H7093]] that [[H3588]] I [[H5315]] should be patient? [[H748]] 
12 Is my strength [[H3581]] like that [[H3581]] of stone, [[H68]] or [[H518]] my flesh [[H1320]] made of bronze? [[H5153]] 
13 [Is] there any [[H518]] help [[H5833]] within me,  now that success [[H8454]] is driven [[H5080]] from me? [[H4480]] 
14 A despairing man [[H4523]] [should have] the kindness [[H2617]] of his friend, [[H7453]] even if he forsakes [[H5800]] the fear [[H3374]] of the Almighty. [[H7706]] 
15 [But] my brothers [[H251]] are as faithless [[H898]] as [[H3644]] a wadi, [[H5158]] as seasonal streams [[H650]] that overflow, [[H5674]] 
16 darkened [[H6937]] because [[H4480]] of the ice [[H7140]] and the inflow [[H5921]] of melting [[H5956]] snow, [[H7950]] 
17 but ceasing [[H6789]] in the dry season [[H6256]] [and] vanishing [[H1846]] from their channels [[H4725]] in the heat. [[H2527]] 
18 Caravans [[H734]] turn aside [[H3943]] from their routes; [[H1870]] they go [[H5927]] into the wasteland [[H8414]] and perish. [[H6]] 
19 The caravans [[H734]] of Tema [[H8485]] look [for water]; [[H5027]] the travelers [[H1979]] of Sheba [[H7614]] hope [[H6960]] to find it.  
20 They are confounded [[H954]] by [[H3588]] their confidence; [[H982]] their arrival [[H935]] brings disappointment. [[H2659]] 
21 For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] you are [[H1961]] of no help; [[H3808]] you see [[H7200]] terror, [[H2866]] and you are afraid. [[H3372]] 
22 Have I ever [[H3588]] said: [[H559]] ‘Give me something; [[H3051]] offer me a bribe [[H7809]] from your wealth; [[H3581]] 
23 ‘deliver me [[H4422]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy; [[H6862]] redeem me [[H6299]] from the grasp [[H3027]] of the ruthless’? [[H6184]] 
24 Teach me, [[H3384]] and I [[H589]] will be silent. [[H2790]] Help me understand [[H995]] how [[H4100]] I have erred. [[H7686]] 
25 How [[H4100]] painful [[H4834]] [are] honest [[H3476]] words! [[H561]] But what [[H4100]] does your argument [[H3198]] prove? [[H3198]] 
26 Do you intend [[H2803]] to correct [[H3198]] my words, [[H4405]] and treat the speech [[H561]] of a desperate man [[H2976]] as wind? [[H7307]] 
27 You would even cast lots [[H5307]] for the fatherless [[H3738]] and negotiate a price [[H5921]] for your friend. [[H7453]] 
28 But now, [[H6258]] please [[H2974]] look at me; [[H6437]] would I lie [[H3576]] to [[H5921]] your face? [[H6440]] 
29 Reconsider; [[H7725]] do not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] unjust. [[H5766]] Reconsider, [[H7725]] for my righteousness [[H6664]] is at stake.  
30 Is there [[H3426]] iniquity [[H5766]] on my tongue? [[H3956]] Can [[H518]] my mouth [[H2441]] not [[H3808]] discern [[H995]] malice? [[H1942]]
