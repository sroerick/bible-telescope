# Job 8

1 Then Bildad [[H1085]] the Shuhite [[H7747]] replied: [[H6030]] 
2 “How long [[H5704]] will you go on saying [[H4448]] such things? [[H428]] The words [[H561]] of your mouth [[H6310]] are a blustering [[H3524]] wind. [[H7307]] 
3 Does God [[H410]] pervert [[H5791]] justice? [[H4941]] Or [[H518]] does the Almighty [[H7706]] pervert [[H5791]] what is right? [[H6664]] 
4 When [[H518]] your children [[H1121]] sinned against Him, [[H2398]] He gave them over [[H7971]] to their rebellion. [[H6588]] 
5 But if [[H518]] you [[H859]] would earnestly seek [[H7836]] God [[H410]] and ask the Almighty [[H7706]] for mercy, [[H2603]] 
6 if [[H518]] you [[H859]] are pure [[H2134]] and upright, [[H3477]] even [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] He will rouse Himself [[H5782]] on your behalf [[H5921]] and restore [[H7999]] your righteous [[H6664]] estate. [[H5116]] 
7 Though your beginnings [[H7225]] were [[H1961]] modest, [[H4705]] your latter days [[H319]] will be full of prosperity. [[H7685]] 
8 Please [[H4994]] inquire [[H7592]] of past [[H7223]] generations [[H1755]] and consider [[H3559]] the discoveries [[H2714]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
9 For [[H3588]] we [were born] [[H587]] yesterday [[H8543]] and know [[H3045]] nothing; [[H3808]] our days [[H3117]] on [[H5921]] earth [[H776]] are but a shadow. [[H6738]] 
10 Will they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] teach you [[H3384]] and tell [[H559]] you,  and speak [[H3318]] from their understanding? [[H3820]] 
11 Does papyrus [[H1573]] grow [[H1342]] where there is no [[H3808]] marsh? [[H1207]] Do reeds [[H260]] flourish [[H7685]] without [[H1097]] water? [[H4325]] 
12 While [[H5750]] the shoots [[H3]] are still uncut, [[H3808]] they dry up [[H3001]] quicker than [[H6440]] grass. [[H2682]] 
13 Such [[H3651]] is the destiny [[H734]] of all [[H3605]] who forget [[H7911]] God; [[H410]] so the hope [[H8615]] of the godless [[H2611]] will perish. [[H6]] 
14 His [[H834]] confidence [[H3689]] is fragile; [[H6990]] his security [[H4009]] is in a spider’s [[H5908]] web. [[H1004]] 
15 He leans [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] his web, [[H1004]] but it gives way; [[H5975]] he holds fast, [[H2388]] but it does not [[H3808]] endure. [[H6965]] 
16 He [[H1931]] is a well-watered plant [[H7373]] in [[H6440]] the sunshine, [[H8121]] spreading [[H3318]] its shoots [[H3127]] over [[H5921]] the garden. [[H1593]] 
17 His roots [[H8328]] wrap [[H5440]] around [[H5921]] the rock heap; [[H1530]] he looks for [[H2372]] a home among [[H1004]] the stones. [[H68]] 
18 If [[H518]] he is uprooted [[H1104]] from his place, [[H4725]] it will disown [[H3584]] him,  saying, ‘I never [[H3808]] saw you.’ [[H7200]] 
19 Surely [[H2005]] this [[H1931]] is the joy [[H4885]] of His way; [[H1870]] yet others [[H312]] will spring [[H6779]] from the dust. [[H6083]] 
20 Behold, [[H2005]] God [[H410]] does not [[H3808]] reject [[H3988]] the blameless, [[H8535]] nor will He [[H3808]] strengthen [[H2388]] the hand [[H3027]] of evildoers. [[H7489]] 
21 He will yet [[H5704]] fill your mouth [[H6310]] with [[H4390]] laughter, [[H7814]] and your lips [[H8193]] with a shout of joy. [[H8643]] 
22 Your enemies [[H8130]] will be clothed [[H3847]] in shame, [[H1322]] and the tent [[H168]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will be no more.” [[H369]]
