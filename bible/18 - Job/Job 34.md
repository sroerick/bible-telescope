# Job 34
[[Job 33|←]] • [[Job 35|→]]
1 Then Elihu [[H453]] continued [[H6030]] and said: [[H559]] 
2 “Hear [[H8085]] my words, [[H4405]] you wise men; [[H2450]] give ear [[H238]] to me,  you men of learning. [[H3045]] 
3 For [[H3588]] the ear [[H241]] tests [[H974]] words [[H4405]] as the mouth [[H2441]] tastes [[H2938]] food. [[H398]] 
4 Let us choose [[H977]] for ourselves  what is right; [[H4941]] let us learn [[H3045]] together [[H996]] what [[H4100]] is good. [[H2896]] 
5 For [[H3588]] Job [[H347]] has declared, [[H559]] ‘I am righteous, [[H6663]] yet God [[H410]] has deprived me of [[H5493]] justice. [[H4941]] 
6 Would I lie [[H3576]] about [[H5921]] my case? [[H4941]] My wound [[H2671]] is incurable, [[H605]] though I am without [[H1097]] transgression.’ [[H6588]] 
7 What [[H4310]] man [[H1397]] is like Job, [[H347]] [who] drinks up [[H8354]] derision [[H3933]] like water? [[H4325]] 
8 He keeps [[H732]] company [[H2274]] with [[H5973]] evildoers [[H6466]] and walks [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] wicked [[H7562]] men. [[H376]] 
9 For [[H3588]] he has said, [[H559]] ‘It profits [[H5532]] a man [[H1397]] nothing [[H3808]] that he should delight [[H7521]] in [[H5973]] God.’ [[H430]] 
10 Therefore [[H3651]] listen [[H8085]] to me,  you men [[H376]] of understanding. [[H3824]] Far be it [[H2486]] from God [[H410]] to do wrong, [[H7562]] and for the Almighty [[H7706]] to act unjustly. [[H5766]] 
11 For [[H3588]] according to a man's deeds, [[H6467]] He repays him; [[H7999]] according to a man's [[H376]] ways, [[H734]] He brings consequences. [[H4672]] 
12 Indeed, [[H637]] it is true [[H551]] that God [[H410]] does not [[H3808]] act wickedly [[H7561]] and the Almighty [[H7706]] does not [[H3808]] pervert [[H5791]] justice. [[H4941]] 
13 Who [[H4310]] gave Him charge [[H6485]] over the earth? [[H776]] Who [[H4310]] appointed [Him] [[H7760]] [over] the whole [[H3605]] world? [[H8398]] 
14 If [[H518]] He were to set [[H7760]] His heart [[H3820]] to it [[H413]] and withdraw [[H622]] His Spirit [[H7307]] and breath, [[H5397]] 
15 all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] would perish [[H1478]] together [[H3162]] and mankind [[H120]] would return [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the dust. [[H6083]] 
16 If [[H518]] you have understanding, [[H998]] hear [[H8085]] this; [[H2063]] listen to [[H238]] my words. [[H4405]] 
17 Could [[H637]] one who hates [[H8130]] justice [[H4941]] govern? [[H2280]] Will you condemn [[H7561]] the just [[H6662]] and mighty One, [[H3524]] 
18 who says [[H559]] to kings, [[H4428]] ‘[You are] worthless!’ [[H1100]] and to [[H413]] nobles, [[H5081]] ‘[You are] wicked,’ [[H7563]] 
19 who [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] partial [[H5375]] to princes [[H8269]] and does not [[H3808]] favor [[H5234]] rich [[H7771]] over [[H6440]] poor? [[H1800]] For [[H3588]] they are all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of His hands. [[H3027]] 
20 They die [[H4191]] in a moment, [[H7281]] and at midnight; [[H2676]] the people [[H5971]] convulse [[H1607]] and pass away; [[H5674]] the mighty [[H47]] are removed [[H5493]] without [[H3808]] human hand. [[H3027]] 
21 For [[H3588]] His eyes [are] [[H5869]] on [[H5921]] the ways [[H1870]] of man, [[H376]] and He sees [[H7200]] his every step. [[H6806]] 
22 There is no [[H369]] darkness [[H2822]] [or] [[H369]] deep shadow [[H6757]] where [[H8033]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] can hide. [[H5641]] 
23 For [[H3588]] God [[H410]] need not [[H3808]] examine [[H7760]] a man [[H376]] further, [[H5750]] for one to approach Him [[H1980]] in judgment. [[H4941]] 
24 He shatters [[H7489]] the mighty [[H3524]] without [[H3808]] inquiry [[H2714]] and sets up [[H5975]] others [[H312]] in their place. [[H8478]] 
25 Therefore, [[H3651]] He recognizes [[H5234]] their deeds; [[H4566]] He overthrows [them] [[H2015]] in the night [[H3915]] and they are crushed. [[H1792]] 
26 He strikes [[H5606]] them for [[H8478]] their wickedness [[H7563]] in full [[H4725]] view, [[H7200]] 
27 because [[H834]] they turned aside [[H5493]] from Him [[H310]] and had no [[H3808]] regard [[H7919]] for any [[H3605]] of His ways. [[H1870]] 
28 They caused the cry [[H6818]] of the poor [[H1800]] to come [[H935]] before Him, [[H5921]] and He heard [[H8085]] the outcry [[H6818]] of the afflicted. [[H6041]] 
29 But when He [[H1931]] remains silent, [[H8252]] who [[H4310]] can condemn Him? [[H7561]] When He hides [[H5641]] His face, [[H6440]] who [[H4310]] can see Him? [[H7789]] Yet He watches over [[H5921]] both [[H3162]] man [[H120]] and nation, [[H1471]] 
30 that godless [[H2611]] men [[H120]] should not rule [[H4427]] or lay snares [[H4170]] for the people. [[H5971]] 
31 Suppose [[H3588]] someone says [[H559]] to [[H413]] God, [[H410]] ‘I have endured my punishment; [[H5375]] I will offend [[H2254]] no more. [[H3808]] 
32 Teach [[H3384]] me what I cannot [[H1107]] see; [[H2372]] if [[H518]] I have done [[H6466]] wrong, [[H5766]] I will not [[H3808]] do it again.’ [[H3254]] 
33 Should God repay you [[H7999]] on your own terms [[H5973]] when [[H3588]] you have disavowed His? [[H3988]] You [[H859]] must choose, [[H977]] not [[H3808]] I; [[H589]] so tell me [[H1696]] what [[H4100]] you know. [[H3045]] 
34 Men [[H582]] of understanding [[H3824]] will declare [[H559]] to me,  and the wise [[H2450]] men [[H1397]] who hear [[H8085]] me [will say]:  
35 ‘Job [[H347]] speaks [[H1696]] without [[H3808]] knowledge; [[H1847]] his words [[H1697]] lack [[H3808]] insight.’ [[H7919]] 
36 If only [[H15]] Job [[H347]] were tried [[H974]] to [[H5704]] the utmost [[H5331]] for [[H5921]] answering [[H8666]] like a wicked [[H205]] man. [[H376]] 
37 For [[H3588]] he adds [[H3254]] rebellion [[H6588]] to [[H5921]] his sin; [[H2403]] he claps [his hands] [[H5606]] among us [[H996]] and multiplies [[H7235]] his words [[H561]] against God. [[H410]]
