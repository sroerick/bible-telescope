# Job 7
[[Job 6|←]] • [[Job 8|→]]
1 Is not [[H3808]] man [[H582]] consigned to labor [[H6635]] on [[H5921]] earth? [[H5921]] Are not his days [[H3117]] like those [[H3117]] of a hired hand? [[H7916]] 
2 Like a slave [[H5650]] he longs for [[H7602]] shade; [[H6738]] like a hired man [[H7916]] he waits for [[H6960]] his wages. [[H6467]] 
3 So [[H3651]] I am allotted [[H5157]] months [[H3391]] of futility, [[H7723]] and nights [[H3915]] of misery [[H5999]] are appointed [[H4487]] me.  
4 When [[H518]] I lie down [[H7901]] I think: [[H559]] ‘When [[H4970]] will I get up?’ [[H6965]] But the night [[H6153]] drags on, [[H4059]] and I toss and turn [[H7646]] until [[H5704]] dawn. [[H5399]] 
5 My flesh [[H1320]] is clothed [[H3847]] with worms [[H7415]] and encrusted [[H1487]] with dirt; [[H6083]] my skin [[H5785]] is cracked [[H7280]] and festering. [[H3988]] 
6 My days [[H3117]] are swifter [[H7043]] than [[H4480]] a weaver’s shuttle; [[H708]] they come to an end [[H3615]] without [[H657]] hope. [[H8615]] 
7 Remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] my life [[H2416]] is but a breath. [[H7307]] My eyes [[H5869]] will never [[H3808]] again [[H7725]] see [[H7200]] happiness. [[H2896]] 
8 The eye [[H5869]] that beholds me [[H7210]] will no [[H3808]] longer see me. [[H7789]] You will look [[H5869]] for me,  but I will be no more. [[H369]] 
9 As a cloud [[H6051]] vanishes [[H3615]] and is gone, [[H1980]] so [[H3651]] he who goes down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] will never [[H3808]] rise again. [[H5927]] 
10 He will never [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to his house; [[H1004]] his place [[H4725]] will [[H3808]] remember him [[H5234]] no more. [[H5750]] 
11 Therefore [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will not [[H3808]] restrain [[H2820]] my mouth; [[H6310]] I will speak [[H1696]] in the anguish [[H6862]] of my spirit; [[H7307]] I will complain [[H7878]] in the bitterness [[H4751]] of my soul. [[H5315]] 
12 Am I [[H589]] the sea, [[H3220]] or [[H518]] the monster of the deep, [[H8577]] that [[H3588]] You must keep me under [[H7760]] guard? [[H4929]] 
13 When [[H3588]] I think [[H559]] my bed [[H6210]] will comfort me, [[H5162]] and my couch [[H4904]] will ease [[H5375]] my complaint, [[H7878]] 
14 then You frighten me [[H2865]] with dreams, [[H2472]] and terrify me [[H1204]] with visions, [[H2384]] 
15 so that I [[H5315]] would prefer [[H977]] strangling [[H4267]] and death [[H4194]] over my life in this body. [[H6106]] 
16 I loathe [my life]! [[H3988]] I would not [[H3808]] live [[H2421]] forever. [[H5769]] Leave me alone, [[H2308]] for [[H3588]] my days [are] [[H3117]] [but] a breath. [[H1892]] 
17 What [[H4100]] is man [[H582]] that [[H3588]] You should exalt him, [[H1431]] that [[H3588]] You should set [[H7896]] Your heart [[H3820]] upon him, [[H413]] 
18 that You attend to him [[H6485]] every morning, [[H1242]] [and] test him [[H974]] every moment? [[H7281]] 
19 Will You never [[H4100]] look away [[H8159]] from me, [[H4480]] or [[H3808]] let me alone [[H7503]] to [[H5704]] swallow [[H1104]] my spittle? [[H7536]] 
20 If I have sinned, [[H2398]] what [[H4100]] have I done to You, [[H6466]] O Watcher [[H5341]] of mankind? [[H120]] Why [[H4100]] have You made me [[H7760]] Your target, [[H4645]] so that I am [[H1961]] a burden [[H4853]] to You? [[H5921]] 
21 Why [[H4100]] do You not [[H3808]] pardon [[H5375]] my transgression [[H6588]] and take away [[H5674]] my iniquity? [[H5771]] For [[H3588]] soon [[H6258]] I will lie down [[H7901]] in the dust; [[H6083]] You will seek me, [[H7836]] but I will be no more.” [[H369]]
