# Job 17
[[Job 16|←]] • [[Job 18|→]]
1 My spirit [[H7307]] is broken; [[H2254]] my days [[H3117]] are extinguished; [[H2193]] the grave [[H6913]] awaits me.  
2 Surely [[H518]] mockers [[H2049]] surround me [[H5978]] and my eyes [[H5869]] must gaze [[H3885]] at their rebellion. [[H4784]] 
3 Give [me], [[H7760]] I pray, [[H4994]] the pledge [[H6148]] You [demand]. [[H5973]] Who else [[H4310]] will be my guarantor? [[H3027]] 
4 You have closed [[H6845]] their minds [[H3820]] to understanding; [[H7922]] therefore [[H5921]] You will not [[H3808]] exalt them. [[H7311]] 
5 If a man denounces [[H5046]] his friends [[H7453]] for a price, [[H2506]] the eyes [[H5869]] of his children [[H1121]] will fail. [[H3615]] 
6 He has made me [[H3322]] a byword [[H4914]] to the people; [[H5971]] I am the one [[H1961]] in whose face [[H6440]] they spit. [[H8611]] 
7 My eyes [[H5869]] have grown dim [[H3543]] with grief, [[H3708]] and my whole [[H3605]] body [[H3338]] is but a shadow. [[H6738]] 
8 The upright [[H3477]] are appalled [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] this, [[H2063]] and the innocent [[H5355]] are stirred [[H5782]] against [[H5921]] the godless. [[H2611]] 
9 Yet the righteous [[H6662]] will hold [[H270]] to his way, [[H1870]] and the one with clean hands [[H3027]] will grow [[H3254]] stronger. [[H555]] 
10 But [[H199]] come back [[H935]] and try again, [[H7725]] all of you. [[H3605]] For I will not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] a wise man [[H2450]] among you.  
11 My days [[H3117]] have passed; [[H5674]] my plans [[H2154]] are broken off— [[H5423]] even the desires [[H4180]] of my heart. [[H3824]] 
12 They have turned [[H7760]] night [[H3915]] into day [[H3117]] and have made light [[H216]] seem near [[H7138]] in the face [[H6440]] of darkness. [[H2822]] 
13 If [[H518]] I look [[H6960]] for Sheol [[H7585]] as my home, [[H1004]] if I spread out [[H7502]] my bed [[H3326]] in darkness, [[H2822]] 
14 and say [[H7121]] to corruption, [[H7845]] ‘You [are] [[H859]] my father,’ [[H1]] and to the worm, [[H7415]] ‘My mother,’ [[H517]] or ‘My sister,’ [[H269]] 
15 where [[H346]] then [[H645]] is my hope? [[H8615]] Who [[H4310]] can see [[H7789]] any hope for me? [[H8615]] 
16 Will it go down [[H3381]] to the gates [[H905]] of Sheol? [[H7585]] Will we go down [[H5183]] together [[H3162]] into [[H5921]] the dust?” [[H6083]]
