# Job 24
[[Job 23|←]] • [[Job 25|→]]
1 Why [[H4069]] does the Almighty [[H7706]] not [[H3808]] reserve [[H6845]] times for judgment? [[H6256]] Why may those who know Him [[H3045]] never [[H3808]] see [[H2372]] His days? [[H3117]] 
2 Men move [[H5381]] boundary stones; [[H1367]] they pasture [[H7462]] stolen [[H1497]] flocks. [[H5739]] 
3 They drive away [[H5090]] the donkey [[H2543]] of the fatherless [[H3490]] and take the widow’s [[H490]] ox [[H7794]] in pledge. [[H2254]] 
4 They push [[H5186]] the needy [[H34]] off the road [[H1870]] and force all [[H3162]] the poor [[H6035]] of the land [[H776]] into hiding. [[H2244]] 
5 Indeed, [[H2005]] [like] wild donkeys [[H6501]] in the desert, [[H4057]] the poor go [[H3318]] to work [[H6467]] foraging [[H7836]] for food; [[H2964]] the wasteland [[H6160]] is food [[H3899]] for their children. [[H5288]] 
6 They gather [[H7114]] fodder [[H1098]] in the fields [[H7704]] and glean [[H3953]] the vineyards [[H3754]] of the wicked. [[H7563]] 
7 Without [[H1097]] clothing, [[H3830]] they spend the night [[H3885]] naked; [[H6174]] they have no [[H369]] covering [[H3682]] against the cold. [[H7135]] 
8 Drenched [[H7372]] by mountain [[H2022]] rains, [[H2230]] they huddle [[H2263]] against the rocks [[H6697]] for want [[H1097]] of shelter. [[H4268]] 
9 The fatherless infant [[H3490]] is snatched [[H1497]] from the breast; [[H7699]] the nursing child [[H5764]] of the poor [[H6041]] is seized for a debt. [[H2254]] 
10 Without [[H1097]] clothing, [[H3830]] they wander about [[H1980]] naked. [[H6174]] They carry [[H5375]] the sheaves, [[H6016]] but still go hungry. [[H7456]] 
11 They crush olives [[H6671]] within [[H996]] their walls; [[H7791]] they tread [[H1869]] the winepresses, [[H3342]] but go thirsty. [[H6770]] 
12 From the city, [[H5892]] men [[H4962]] groan, [[H5008]] and the souls [[H5315]] of the wounded [[H2491]] cry out, [[H7768]] yet God [[H433]] charges [[H7760]] no one [[H3808]] with wrongdoing. [[H8604]] 
13 Then there [[H1992]] are [[H1961]] those who rebel [[H4775]] against the light, [[H216]] not [[H3808]] knowing [[H5234]] its ways [[H1870]] or staying [[H3427]] on its paths. [[H5410]] 
14 When daylight [is gone], [[H216]] the murderer [[H7523]] rises [[H6965]] to kill [[H6991]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy; [[H34]] in the night [[H3915]] he is [[H1961]] like a thief. [[H1590]] 
15 The eye [[H5869]] of the adulterer [[H5003]] watches [[H8104]] for twilight. [[H5399]] Thinking, [[H559]] ‘No [[H3808]] eye [[H5869]] will see me,’ [[H7789]] he covers [[H5643]] his face. [[H6440]] 
16 In the dark [[H2822]] they dig through [[H2864]] houses; [[H1004]] by day [[H3119]] they shut themselves in, [[H2856]] never [[H3808]] to experience [[H3045]] the light. [[H216]] 
17 For [[H3588]] to them,  deep darkness [[H6757]] is their [[H3162]] morning; [[H1242]] surely [[H3588]] they are friends with [[H5234]] the terrors [[H1091]] of darkness! [[H6757]] 
18 They [[H1931]] are but foam [[H7031]] on [[H5921]] the surface [[H6440]] of the water; [[H4325]] their portion [[H2513]] of the land [[H776]] is cursed, [[H7043]] so that no one [[H3808]] [would] turn [[H6437]] into [[H1870]] their vineyards. [[H3754]] 
19 As drought [[H6723]] and [[H1571]] heat [[H2527]] consume [[H1497]] the melting snow, [[H7950]] so Sheol [[H7585]] steals those who have sinned. [[H2398]] 
20 The womb [[H7358]] forgets them; [[H7911]] the worm [[H7415]] feeds on them; [[H4988]] they are remembered [[H2142]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]] So injustice [[H5766]] is like a broken [[H7665]] tree. [[H6086]] 
21 They prey [[H7462]] on the barren [[H6135]] and childless, [[H3808]] and show no [[H3808]] kindness [[H3190]] to the widow. [[H490]] 
22 Yet by His power, [[H3581]] God drags away [[H4900]] the mighty. [[H47]] though rising up, [[H6965]] they have no [[H3808]] assurance [[H539]] of life. [[H2416]] 
23 He gives [[H5414]] them  a sense of security, [[H983]] but His eyes [[H5869]] are on [[H5921]] their ways. [[H1870]] 
24 They are exalted [[H7426]] for a moment, [[H4592]] then they are gone; [[H369]] they are brought low [[H4355]] and gathered up [[H7092]] like all others; [[H3605]] they are cut off [[H5243]] like heads [[H7218]] of grain. [[H7641]] 
25 If [[H518]] this is not so, [[H3808]] then [[H645]] who [[H4310]] can prove me a liar [[H3576]] and reduce [[H7760]] my words [[H4405]] to nothing?” [[H408]]
