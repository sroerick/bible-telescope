# Job 3
[[Job 2|←]] • [[Job 4|→]]
1 After [[H310]] this, [[H3651]] Job [[H347]] opened [[H6605]] his mouth [[H6310]] and cursed [[H7043]] the day of his [birth]. [[H3117]] 
2 And [this is what] [[H6030]] [he] [[H347]] said: [[H559]] 
3 “May the day [[H3117]] of my birth [[H3205]] perish, [[H6]] and the night [[H3915]] it was said, [[H559]] ‘A boy [[H1397]] is conceived.’ [[H2030]] 
4 If only that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] had turned [[H1961]] to darkness! [[H2822]] May God [[H433]] above [[H4605]] disregard it; [[H1875]] [may no] light [[H5105]] shine [[H3313]] upon it. [[H5921]] 
5 May darkness [[H2822]] and gloom [[H6757]] reclaim it, [[H1350]] and a cloud [[H6053]] settle [[H7931]] over it; [[H5921]] may the blackness [[H3650]] of the day [[H3117]] overwhelm it. [[H1204]] 
6 If only darkness [[H652]] had taken [[H1931]] that night [[H3915]] away! [[H3947]] May it not [[H408]] appear [[H2302]] among the days [[H3117]] of the year, [[H8141]] or be entered [[H935]] in any [[H4557]] of the months. [[H3391]] 
7 Behold, [[H2009]] may that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] be [[H1961]] barren; [[H1565]] may no [[H408]] joyful voice [[H7445]] come [[H935]] into it.  
8 May it be cursed [[H779]] by those who curse [[H5344]] the day— [[H3117]] those prepared [[H6264]] to rouse [[H5782]] Leviathan. [[H3882]] 
9 May its morning [[H5399]] stars [[H3556]] grow dark; [[H2821]] may it wait [[H6960]] in vain [[H369]] for daylight; [[H216]] may it not [[H408]] see [[H7200]] the breaking of dawn. [[H7837]] 
10 For [[H3588]] that night did not [[H3808]] shut [[H5462]] the doors [[H1817]] of the womb [[H990]] to hide [[H5641]] the sorrow [[H5999]] from my eyes. [[H5869]] 
11 Why [[H4100]] did I not perish [[H4191]] at birth; [[H7358]] why did I not die [[H1478]] as I came [[H3318]] from the womb? [[H990]] 
12 Why [[H4069]] were there knees [[H1290]] to receive me, [[H6923]] [and] [[H4100]] breasts [[H7699]] that [[H3588]] I should be nursed? [[H3243]] 
13 For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] I would be lying down [[H7901]] in peace; [[H8252]] I would be asleep [[H3462]] and [[H227]] at rest [[H5117]] 
14 with [[H5973]] kings [[H4428]] and counselors [[H3289]] of the earth, [[H776]] who built [[H1129]] for themselves  cities now in ruins, [[H2723]] 
15 or [[H176]] with [[H5973]] princes [[H8269]] who had gold, [[H2091]] who filled [[H4390]] their houses [[H1004]] with silver. [[H3701]] 
16 Or [[H176]] why was [[H1961]] I not [[H3808]] hidden [[H2934]] like a stillborn child, [[H5309]] like an infant [[H5768]] who never [[H3808]] sees [[H7200]] daylight? [[H216]] 
17 There [[H8033]] the wicked [[H7563]] cease [[H2308]] from raging, [[H7267]] and there [[H8033]] the weary [[H3019]] find rest. [[H5117]] 
18 The captives [[H615]] enjoy [[H3162]] their ease; [[H7599]] they do not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the oppressor. [[H5065]] 
19 Both small [[H6996]] and great [[H1419]] are there, [[H8033]] and the slave [[H5650]] is freed [[H2670]] from his master. [[H113]] 
20 Why [[H4100]] is light [[H216]] given [[H5414]] to the miserable, [[H6001]] and life [[H2416]] to the bitter [[H4751]] of soul, [[H5315]] 
21 who long [[H2442]] for death [[H4194]] that does not come, [[H369]] and search for it [[H2658]] like hidden treasure, [[H4301]] 
22 who rejoice [[H8055]] and greatly [[H1524]] exult [[H7797]] when [[H3588]] they can find [[H4672]] the grave? [[H6913]] 
23 Why is life given to a man [[H1397]] whose [[H834]] way [[H1870]] is hidden, [[H5641]] whom God [[H433]] has hedged in? [[H5526]] 
24 I sigh [[H585]] when [[H3588]] food [[H3899]] is put [[H935]] before me, [[H6440]] and my groans [[H7581]] pour out [[H5413]] like water. [[H4325]] 
25 For [[H3588]] the thing [[H6343]] I feared [[H6342]] has overtaken me, [[H857]] and what [[H834]] I dreaded [[H3025]] has befallen [[H935]] me.  
26 I am not [[H3808]] at ease [[H7951]] or quiet; [[H8252]] I have no [[H3808]] rest, [[H5117]] for trouble [[H7267]] has come.” [[H935]]
