# Job 11

1 Then Zophar [[H6691]] the Naamathite [[H5284]] replied: [[H6030]] 
2 “Should this stream [[H7230]] of words [[H1697]] go unanswered [[H3808]] and such [[H518]] a speaker [[H376]] be vindicated? [[H6663]] 
3 Should your babbling [[H907]] put others [[H4962]] to silence? [[H2790]] Will you scoff [[H3932]] without [[H369]] rebuke? [[H3637]] 
4 You have said, [[H559]] ‘My doctrine [is] [[H3948]] sound, [[H2134]] and I am [[H1961]] pure [[H1249]] in Your sight.’ [[H5869]] 
5 But [[H199]] if only [[H4310]] God [[H433]] would speak [[H1696]] and open [[H6605]] His lips [[H8193]] against you, [[H5973]] 
6 and disclose [[H5046]] to you  the secrets [[H8587]] of wisdom, [[H2451]] for [[H3588]] true wisdom [[H8454]] has two sides. [[H3718]] Know [[H3045]] then that [[H3588]] God [[H433]] exacts [[H5382]] from you  [less] than your iniquity [deserves]. [[H5771]] 
7 Can you fathom [[H4672]] the deep things [[H2714]] of God [[H433]] or [[H518]] discover [[H4672]] the limits [[H8503]] of the Almighty? [[H7706]] 
8 They are higher [[H1363]] than the heavens— [[H8064]] what [[H4100]] can you do? [[H6466]] They are deeper [[H6013]] than Sheol— [[H7585]] what [[H4100]] can you know? [[H3045]] 
9 Their measure [[H4055]] is longer [[H752]] than [[H4480]] the earth [[H776]] and wider [[H7342]] than the sea. [[H3220]] 
10 If [[H518]] He comes along [[H2498]] to imprison you, [[H5462]] or convenes a court, [[H6950]] who [[H4310]] can hinder Him? [[H7725]] 
11 Surely [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] knows [[H3045]] the deceit [[H7723]] of men. [[H4962]] If He sees [[H7200]] iniquity, [[H205]] does He not [[H3808]] take note? [[H995]] 
12 But a witless [[H5014]] man [[H376]] can no more become wise [[H3823]] than the colt [[H5895]] of a wild donkey [[H6501]] can be born [[H3205]] a man! [[H120]] 
13 As for you, [[H859]] if [[H518]] you direct [[H3559]] your heart [[H3820]] and lift up [[H6566]] your hands [[H3709]] to Him, [[H413]] 
14 if [[H518]] you put away [[H7368]] the iniquity [[H205]] in your hand, [[H3027]] and allow no [[H408]] injustice [[H5766]] to dwell [[H7931]] in your tents, [[H168]] 
15 then [[H227]] indeed [[H3588]] you will lift up [[H5375]] your face [[H6440]] without shame; [[H3971]] you will [[H1961]] stand firm [[H3332]] and unafraid. [[H3808]] 
16 For [[H3588]] you [[H859]] will forget [[H7911]] [your] misery, [[H5999]] recalling [[H2142]] it only as waters [[H4325]] gone by. [[H5674]] 
17 Your life [[H2465]] will be brighter [[H6965]] than noonday; [[H6672]] its darkness [[H5774]] will be [[H1961]] like the morning. [[H1242]] 
18 You will be secure, [[H982]] because [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] hope, [[H8615]] and you will look around [[H2658]] and lie down [[H7901]] in safety. [[H983]] 
19 You will lie down [[H7257]] without [[H369]] fear, [[H2729]] and many [[H7227]] will court [[H2470]] your favor. [[H6440]] 
20 But the eyes [[H5869]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will fail, [[H3615]] their escape route [[H4498]] will be cut off, [[H6]] and they will hope [[H8615]] for their last breath.” [[H4646]]
