1 Then Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite [[H8489]] replied: [[H6030]] 
2 “If one ventures [[H5254]] a word [[H1697]] with you, [[H413]] will you be wearied? [[H3811]] Yet who [[H4310]] can [[H3201]] keep [[H6113]] from speaking? [[H4405]] 
3 Surely [[H2009]] you have instructed [[H3256]] many, [[H7227]] and have strengthened [[H2388]] their feeble [[H7504]] hands. [[H3027]] 
4 Your words [[H4405]] have steadied [[H6965]] those who stumbled, [[H3782]] and have made firm [[H553]] the knees [[H1290]] that were buckling. [[H3766]] 
5 But [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] it has come [[H935]] upon you, [[H413]] and you are weary. [[H3811]] It strikes you, [[H5060]] and you are dismayed. [[H926]] 
6 Is your reverence [[H3373]] not [[H3808]] your confidence, [[H3690]] and the uprightness [[H8537]] of your ways [[H1870]] your hope? [[H8615]] 
7 Consider [[H2142]] now: [[H4994]] Who [[H4310]] has perished [[H6]] when [[H1931]] he was innocent? [[H5355]] Or where [[H375]] were the upright [[H3477]] destroyed? [[H3582]] 
8 As [[H834]] I have observed, [[H7200]] those who plow [[H2790]] iniquity, [[H205]] and those who sow [[H2232]] trouble, [[H5999]] reap the same. [[H7114]] 
9 By the breath [[H5397]] of God [[H433]] they perish, [[H6]] and by the blast [[H7307]] of His anger [[H639]] they are consumed. [[H3615]] 
10 The lion [[H738]] may roar, [[H7581]] and the fierce lion [[H7826]] may growl, [[H6963]] yet the teeth [[H8127]] of the young lions [[H3715]] are broken. [[H5421]] 
11 The old lion [[H3918]] perishes [[H6]] for lack [[H1097]] of prey, [[H2964]] and the cubs [[H1121]] of the lioness [[H3833]] are scattered. [[H6504]] 
12 Now a word [[H1697]] came to me [[H413]] secretly; [[H1589]] my ears [[H241]] caught [[H3947]] a whisper [[H8102]] of it. [[H4480]] 
13 In disquieting [[H5587]] visions [[H2384]] in the night, [[H3915]] when deep sleep [[H8639]] falls [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] men, [[H376]] 
14 fear [[H6343]] and trembling [[H7460]] came over me [[H7122]] and made all [[H7230]] my bones [[H6106]] shake. [[H6342]] 
15 Then a spirit [[H7307]] glided [[H2498]] past [[H5921]] my face, [[H6440]] [and] the hair [[H8185]] on my body [[H1320]] bristled. [[H5568]] 
16 It stood still, [[H5975]] but I could not [[H3808]] discern [[H5234]] its appearance; [[H4758]] a form [[H8544]] loomed before [[H5048]] my eyes, [[H5869]] and I heard [[H8085]] a whispering [[H1827]] voice: [[H6963]] 
17 ‘Can a [mortal] [[H376]] be more righteous [[H6663]] than God, [[H433]] or [[H518]] a man [[H1397]] more pure [[H2891]] than his Maker? [[H6213]] 
18 If [[H2005]] God puts no [[H3808]] trust [[H539]] in His servants, [[H5650]] and He charges [[H7760]] His angels [[H4397]] with error, [[H8417]] 
19 how much more [[H637]] those who dwell [[H7931]] in houses [[H1004]] of clay, [[H2563]] whose [[H834]] foundations [[H3247]] are in the dust, [[H6083]] who can be crushed [[H1792]] like a moth! [[H6211]] 
20 They are smashed to pieces [[H3807]] from dawn [[H1242]] to dusk; [[H6153]] unnoticed, [[H1097]] they perish [[H6]] forever. [[H5331]] 
21 Are not their tent cords [[H3499]] pulled up, [[H5265]] so that they die [[H4191]] without [[H3808]] wisdom?’ [[H2451]]
