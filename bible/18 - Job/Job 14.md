# Job 14
[[Job 13|←]] • [[Job 15|→]]
1 Man, [[H120]] who is born [[H3205]] of woman, [[H802]] is short [[H7116]] of days [[H3117]] and full [[H7646]] of trouble. [[H7267]] 
2 Like a flower, [[H6731]] he comes forth, [[H3318]] then withers away; [[H5243]] like a fleeting shadow, [[H6738]] he does not [[H3808]] endure. [[H5975]] 
3 Do You open [[H6491]] your eyes [[H5869]] to one like this? [[H2088]] Will You bring him [[H935]] into judgment [[H4941]] before [[H5973]] You? [[H5921]] 
4 Who [[H4310]] can bring [[H5414]] clean [[H2889]] out of unclean? [[H2931]] No [[H3808]] one! [[H259]] 
5 Since [[H518]] his days [[H3117]] [are] determined [[H2782]] and the number [[H4557]] of his months [[H2320]] [is] with You, [[H854]] and since You have set [[H6213]] limits [[H2706]] that he cannot [[H3808]] exceed, [[H5674]] 
6 look away [[H8159]] from him [[H5921]] and let him rest, [[H2308]] so [[H5704]] he can enjoy [[H7521]] his day [[H3117]] as a hired hand. [[H7916]] 
7 For [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] hope [[H8615]] for a tree: [[H6086]] If [[H518]] it is cut down, [[H3772]] it will sprout [[H2498]] again, [[H5750]] and its tender shoots [[H3127]] will not [[H3808]] fail. [[H2308]] 
8 If [[H518]] its roots [[H8328]] grow old [[H2204]] in the ground [[H776]] and its stump [[H1503]] dies [[H4191]] in the soil, [[H6083]] 
9 at the scent [[H7381]] of water [[H4325]] it will bud [[H6524]] and put forth [[H6213]] twigs [[H7105]] like [[H3644]] a sapling. [[H5194]] 
10 But a man [[H1397]] dies [[H4191]] and is laid low; [[H2522]] he [[H120]] breathes his last, [[H1478]] and where [is] he? [[H346]] 
11 As water [[H4325]] disappears [[H235]] from [[H4480]] the sea [[H3220]] and a river [[H5104]] becomes parched [[H2717]] and dry, [[H3001]] 
12 so man [[H376]] lies down [[H7901]] and does not [[H3808]] rise. [[H6965]] Until [[H5704]] the heavens [[H8064]] are no more, [[H1115]] he will not [[H3808]] be awakened [[H6974]] [or] [[H3808]] roused [[H5782]] from his sleep. [[H8142]] 
13 If only [[H4310]] You would hide [[H6845]] me in Sheol [[H7585]] and conceal me [[H5641]] until [[H5704]] Your anger [[H639]] passes. [[H7725]] If only You would appoint [[H7896]] a time for me [[H2706]] and then remember me. [[H2142]] 
14 When [[H518]] a man [[H1397]] dies, [[H4191]] will he live [again]? [[H2421]] All [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of my hard service [[H6635]] I will wait, [[H3176]] until [[H5704]] my relief [[H2487]] comes. [[H935]] 
15 You will call, [[H7121]] and I [[H595]] will answer You; [[H6030]] You will desire [[H3700]] the work [[H4639]] of Your hands. [[H3027]] 
16 For [[H3588]] then [[H6258]] You would count [[H5608]] my steps, [[H6806]] but would not [[H3808]] keep track [[H8104]] of [[H5921]] my sin. [[H2403]] 
17 My transgression [[H6588]] would be sealed [[H2856]] in a bag, [[H6872]] and You would cover [[H2950]] over [[H5921]] my iniquity. [[H5771]] 
18 But [[H199]] as a mountain [[H2022]] erodes [[H5307]] and crumbles [[H5034]] and a rock [[H6697]] is dislodged [[H6275]] from its place, [[H4725]] 
19 as water [[H4325]] wears away [[H7833]] stones [[H68]] and torrents [[H5599]] wash away [[H7857]] the soil, [[H6083]] so You destroy [[H6]] a man’s [[H582]] hope. [[H8615]] 
20 You forever [[H5331]] overpower him, [[H8630]] and he passes on; [[H1980]] You change [[H8138]] his countenance [[H6440]] and send him away. [[H7971]] 
21 If his sons [[H1121]] receive honor, [[H3513]] he does not [[H3808]] know it; [[H3045]] if they are brought low, [[H6819]] he is unaware. [[H3808]] 
22 He feels only [[H389]] the pain [[H3510]] of his own body [[H1320]] and mourns [[H56]] only for [[H5921]] himself.” [[H5315]]
