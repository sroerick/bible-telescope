# Job 28
[[Job 27|←]] • [[Job 29|→]]
1 Surely [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] a mine [[H4161]] for silver [[H3701]] and a place [[H4725]] where gold [[H2091]] is refined. [[H2212]] 
2 Iron [[H1270]] is taken [[H3947]] from the earth, [[H6083]] and copper [[H5154]] is smelted [[H6694]] from ore. [[H68]] 
3 [Man] puts [[H7760]] an end [[H7093]] to the darkness; [[H2822]] he [[H1931]] probes [[H2713]] the farthest recesses [[H3605]] for ore [[H68]] in deepest darkness. [[H652]] 
4 Far from [[H4480]] human habitation [[H1481]] he cuts [[H6555]] a shaft [[H5158]] in places forgotten [[H7911]] by the foot of man. [[H7272]] Far from men [[H582]] he dangles [[H1809]] and sways. [[H5128]] 
5 Food [[H3899]] may come [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the earth, [[H776]] but from below [[H8478]] it is transformed [[H2015]] as [[H3644]] by fire. [[H784]] 
6 Its rocks [[H68]] are the source [[H4725]] of sapphires, [[H5601]] containing flecks [[H6083]] of gold. [[H2091]] 
7 No [[H3808]] bird of prey [[H5861]] knows [[H3045]] that path; [[H5410]] no [[H3808]] falcon’s [[H344]] eye [[H5869]] has seen it. [[H7805]] 
8 Proud beasts [[H1121]] have never [[H3808]] trodden it; [[H1869]] no [[H3808]] lion [[H7826]] has ever prowled [[H5710]] over it. [[H5921]] 
9 The miner strikes [[H7971]] the flint; [[H2496]] he overturns [[H2015]] mountains [[H2022]] at their base. [[H8328]] 
10 He hews out [[H1234]] channels [[H2975]] in the rocks, [[H6697]] and his eyes [[H5869]] spot [[H7200]] every [[H3605]] treasure. [[H3366]] 
11 He searches [[H2280]] the sources [[H1065]] of the streams [[H5104]] to bring [[H3318]] what is hidden [[H8587]] to light. [[H216]] 
12 But where [[H370]] can wisdom [[H2451]] be found, [[H4672]] and where [[H335]] does understanding [[H998]] dwell? [[H4725]] 
13 No [[H3808]] man [[H582]] can know [[H3045]] its value, [[H6187]] nor [[H3808]] is it found [[H4672]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]] 
14 The ocean depths [[H8415]] say, [[H559]] ‘It [is] [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] in me,’  while the sea [[H3220]] declares, [[H559]] ‘[It is] not [[H369]] with me.’ [[H5978]] 
15 It cannot [[H3808]] be purchased [[H5414]] for gold, [[H8478]] nor [[H3808]] its price [[H4242]] weighed out [[H8254]] in silver. [[H3701]] 
16 It cannot [[H3808]] be valued [[H5541]] in the gold [[H3800]] of Ophir, [[H211]] in precious [[H3368]] onyx [[H7718]] or sapphire. [[H5601]] 
17 Neither [[H3808]] gold [[H2091]] nor crystal [[H2137]] can compare, [[H6186]] nor jewels [[H3627]] of fine gold [[H6337]] be exchanged for it. [[H8545]] 
18 Coral [[H7215]] and quartz [[H1378]] are unworthy [[H3808]] of mention; [[H2142]] the price [[H4901]] of wisdom [is] [[H2451]] beyond rubies. [[H6443]] 
19 Topaz [[H6357]] from Cush [[H3568]] cannot [[H3808]] compare, [[H6186]] nor can it [[H3808]] be valued [[H5541]] in pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H3800]] 
20 From where [[H370]] then does wisdom [[H2451]] come, [[H935]] and where [[H335]] does understanding [[H998]] dwell? [[H4725]] 
21 It is hidden [[H5956]] from the eyes [[H5869]] of every [[H3605]] living thing [[H2416]] and concealed [[H5641]] from the birds [[H5775]] of the air. [[H8064]] 
22 Abaddon [[H11]] and Death [[H4194]] say, [[H559]] ‘We have heard [[H8085]] a rumor about it.’ [[H8088]] 
23 But God [[H430]] understands [[H995]] its way, [[H1870]] and He [[H1931]] knows [[H3045]] its place. [[H4725]] 
24 For [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] looks [[H5027]] to the ends [[H7098]] of the earth [[H776]] and sees [[H7200]] everything [[H3605]] under [[H8478]] the heavens. [[H8064]] 
25 When God fixed [[H6213]] the weight [[H4948]] of the wind [[H7307]] and measured out [[H4060]] the waters, [[H4325]] 
26 when He set [[H6213]] a limit [[H2706]] for the rain [[H4306]] and a path [[H1870]] for the thunderbolt, [[H2385]] 
27 then [[H227]] He looked at [wisdom] [[H7200]] and appraised it; [[H5608]] He established it [[H3559]] and searched it out. [[H2713]] 
28 And He said [[H559]] to man, [[H120]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord, [[H136]] that [is] [[H1931]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and to turn away [[H5493]] from evil [[H7451]] [is] understanding.’” [[H998]]
