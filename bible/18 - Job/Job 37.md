# Job 37
[[Job 36|←]] • [[Job 38|→]]
1 At this [[H2063]] my heart [[H3820]] also [[H637]] pounds [[H2729]] and leaps [[H5425]] from its place. [[H4725]] 
2 Listen [[H8085]] closely [[H8085]] to the thunder [[H7267]] of His voice [[H6963]] and the rumbling [[H1899]] [that] comes [[H3318]] from His mouth. [[H6310]] 
3 He unleashes [[H3474]] His lightning [[H216]] beneath [[H8478]] the whole [[H3605]] sky [[H8064]] and sends it [[H5921]] to the ends [[H3671]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
4 Then [[H310]] there comes a roaring [[H7580]] sound; [[H6963]] He thunders [[H7481]] with His majestic [[H1347]] voice. [[H6963]] He does not [[H3808]] restrain [the lightning] [[H6117]] when [[H3588]] His voice [[H6963]] resounds. [[H8085]] 
5 God [[H410]] thunders [[H7481]] wondrously [[H6381]] with His voice; [[H6963]] He does [[H6213]] great things [[H1419]] we cannot [[H3808]] comprehend. [[H3045]] 
6 For [[H3588]] He says [[H559]] to the snow, [[H7950]] ‘Fall [[H1933]] [on] the earth,’ [[H776]] and to the gentle rain, [[H1653]] ‘Pour out [[H1653]] a mighty [[H5797]] downpour.’ [[H4306]] 
7 He seals up [[H2856]] the hand [[H3027]] of every [[H3605]] man, [[H120]] so that all [[H3605]] men [[H376]] may know [[H3045]] His work. [[H4639]] 
8 The wild animals [[H2416]] enter [[H935]] their lairs; [[H695]] they settle down [[H7931]] in their dens. [[H4585]] 
9 The tempest [[H5492]] comes [[H935]] from [[H4480]] its chamber, [[H2315]] and the cold [[H7135]] from the driving north winds. [[H4215]] 
10 By the breath [[H5397]] of God [[H410]] the ice [[H7140]] is formed [[H5414]] and the watery [[H4325]] expanses [[H7341]] are frozen. [[H4164]] 
11 He loads [[H2959]] the clouds [[H5645]] with moisture; [[H7377]] He scatters [[H6327]] His lightning [[H216]] through them. [[H6051]] 
12 They [[H1931]] swirl about, [[H4524]] turning round and round [[H2015]] at His direction, [[H8458]] accomplishing [[H6467]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] He commands [[H6680]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of all [[H8398]] the earth. [[H776]] 
13 Whether [[H518]] for punishment [[H7626]] or [[H518]] for His land, [[H776]] He accomplishes this [[H4672]] in His loving devotion. [[H2617]] 
14 Listen [[H238]] to this, [[H2063]] Job; [[H347]] stand still [[H5975]] and consider [[H995]] the wonders [[H6381]] of God. [[H410]] 
15 Do you know [[H3045]] how God [[H433]] dispatches [[H7760]] the clouds [[H6051]] or makes the lightning [[H216]] flash? [[H3313]] 
16 Do you understand [[H3045]] how [[H5921]] the clouds [[H5645]] float, [[H4657]] those wonders [[H4652]] of Him who is perfect [[H8549]] in knowledge? [[H1843]] 
17 You whose [[H834]] clothes [[H899]] get hot [[H2525]] when the land [[H776]] lies hushed [[H8252]] under the south wind, [[H1864]] 
18 can you, like Him, [[H5973]] spread out [[H7554]] the skies [[H7834]] to reflect the heat [[H2389]] like a mirror [[H7209]] of bronze? [[H3332]] 
19 Teach [[H3045]] us what [[H4100]] we should say [[H559]] to Him;  we cannot [[H3808]] draw up our case [[H6186]] when our faces [[H6440]] are in darkness. [[H2822]] 
20 Should He be told [[H5608]] that [[H3588]] I want to speak? [[H1696]] Would a man [[H376]] ask [[H559]] to be swallowed up? [[H1104]] 
21 Now [[H6258]] no one [[H3808]] can gaze [[H7200]] at the sun [[H216]] [when] it [is] [[H1931]] bright [[H925]] in the skies [[H7834]] after the wind [[H7307]] has swept [[H5674]] them clean. [[H2891]] 
22 Out of the north [[H6828]] He comes [[H857]] in golden [splendor]; [[H2091]] awesome [[H3372]] majesty [[H1935]] surrounds [[H5921]] Him. [[H433]] 
23 The Almighty [[H7706]] is beyond [[H3808]] our reach; [[H4672]] He is exalted [[H7689]] in power! [[H3581]] In His justice [[H4941]] and great [[H7230]] righteousness, [[H6666]] He does not [[H3808]] oppress. [[H6031]] 
24 Therefore, [[H3651]] men [[H582]] fear Him, [[H3372]] for He is not [[H3808]] partial [[H7200]] to the [[H3605]] wise [[H2450]] in heart.” [[H3820]]
