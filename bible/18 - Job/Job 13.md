# Job 13
[[Job 12|←]] • [[Job 14|→]]
1 Behold, [[H2005]] my eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] all this; [[H3605]] my ears [[H241]] have heard [[H8085]] and understood. [[H995]] 
2 What you know, [[H1847]] I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] know; [[H3045]] I [[H595]] am not [[H3808]] inferior [[H5307]] to you. [[H4480]] 
3 Yet [[H199]] I [[H589]] desire [[H2654]] to speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Almighty [[H7706]] and argue my case [[H3198]] before [[H413]] God. [[H410]] 
4 You, [[H859]] however, [[H199]] smear [[H2950]] with lies; [[H8267]] you are all [[H3605]] worthless [[H457]] physicians. [[H7495]] 
5 If only [[H4310]] you would be silent; [[H2790]] for that would be [[H1961]] your  wisdom! [[H2451]] 
6 Hear [[H8085]] now [[H4994]] my argument, [[H8433]] and listen [[H7181]] to the plea [[H7379]] of my lips. [[H8193]] 
7 Will you speak [[H1696]] wickedly [[H5766]] on God’s behalf [[H410]] or speak [[H1696]] deceitfully for Him? [[H7423]] 
8 Would you show Him partiality [[H6440]] or [[H518]] argue [[H7378]] in His defense? [[H410]] 
9 Would it be well [[H2896]] when [[H3588]] He examined you? [[H2713]] Could you deceive [[H2048]] Him  [like] [[H2048]] a man? [[H376]] 
10 Surely He would rebuke [[H3198]] you [[H3198]] if [[H518]] you secretly [[H5643]] showed partiality. [[H6440]] 
11 Would His majesty [[H7613]] not [[H3808]] terrify you? [[H1204]] Would the dread of Him [[H6343]] not fall [[H5307]] upon you? [[H5921]] 
12 Your maxims [[H2146]] are proverbs [[H4911]] of ashes; [[H665]] your defenses [[H1354]] are defenses [[H1354]] of clay. [[H2563]] 
13 Be silent, [[H2790]] and I [[H589]] will speak. [[H1696]] Then let come [[H5674]] to me [[H5921]] what [may]. [[H4100]] 
14 Why [[H5921]] do I put myself [[H1320]] at risk [[H5375]] and take [[H7760]] my life [[H5315]] in my own hands? [[H3709]] 
15 Though [[H2005]] He slay me, [[H6991]] I will hope in Him. [[H3176]] I will still [[H389]] defend [[H3198]] my ways [[H1870]] to [[H413]] His face. [[H6440]] 
16 Moreover, [[H1571]] this will be my salvation, [[H3444]] for [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] godless man [[H2611]] can appear [[H935]] before Him. [[H6440]] 
17 Listen [[H8085]] carefully [[H8085]] to my words; [[H4405]] let my declaration [[H262]] ring in your ears. [[H241]] 
18 Behold, [[H2009]] now that [[H4994]] I have prepared [[H6186]] my case, [[H4941]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will be vindicated. [[H6663]] 
19 Can anyone [[H4310]] indict [[H7378]] me? [[H5978]] If [[H3588]] so, [[H6258]] I will be silent [[H2790]] and die. [[H1478]] 
20 Only [[H389]] grant [[H6213]] these two [[H8147]] things to me, [[H5978]] so that [[H227]] I need not [[H3808]] hide [[H5641]] from You: [[H6440]] 
21 Withdraw [[H7368]] Your hand [[H3709]] from me, [[H5921]] and do not [[H408]] let Your terror [[H367]] frighten me. [[H1204]] 
22 Then call me, [[H7121]] and I [[H595]] will answer, [[H6030]] or [[H176]] let me speak, [[H1696]] and You can reply. [[H7725]] 
23 How many [[H4100]] [are] my  iniquities [[H5771]] and sins? [[H2403]] Reveal to me [[H3045]] my transgression [[H6588]] and sin. [[H2403]] 
24 Why [[H4100]] do You hide [[H5641]] Your face [[H6440]] and consider me [[H2803]] as Your  enemy? [[H341]] 
25 Will You frighten [[H6206]] a windblown [[H5086]] leaf? [[H5929]] Will You chase after [[H7291]] dry [[H3002]] chaff? [[H7179]] 
26 For [[H3588]] You record [[H3789]] bitter accusations [[H4846]] against me [[H5921]] and bequeath to me [[H3423]] the iniquities [[H5771]] of my youth. [[H5271]] 
27 You put [[H7760]] my feet [[H7272]] in the stocks [[H5465]] and stand watch [[H8104]] over all [[H3605]] my paths; [[H734]] You set a limit [[H2707]] for [[H5921]] the soles [[H8328]] of my feet. [[H7272]] 
28 So man [[H1931]] wastes away [[H1086]] like something rotten, [[H7538]] like a moth-eaten [[H398]] garment. [[H899]]
