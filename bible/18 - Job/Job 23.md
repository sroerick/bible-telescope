1 Then Job [[H347]] answered: [[H6030]] 
2 “Even [[H1571]] today [[H3117]] my complaint [[H7879]] is bitter. [[H4805]] His hand [[H3027]] is heavy [[H3513]] despite [[H5921]] my groaning. [[H585]] 
3 If only [[H4310]] I knew [[H3045]] where to find Him, [[H4672]] so that I could go [[H935]] to [[H5704]] His seat. [[H8499]] 
4 I would plead [[H6186]] my case [[H4941]] before Him [[H6440]] and fill my mouth [[H6310]] with [[H4390]] arguments. [[H8433]] 
5 I would learn [[H3045]] how [[H4405]] He would answer, [[H6030]] and consider [[H995]] what [[H4100]] He would say. [[H559]] 
6 Would He contend [[H7378]] with me [[H5978]] in His great [[H7227]] power? [[H3581]] No, [[H3808]] He [[H1931]] would certainly [[H389]] take [note] [[H7760]] of me.  
7 Then [[H8033]] an upright man [[H3477]] could reason [[H3198]] with Him, [[H5973]] and I would be delivered [[H6403]] forever [[H5331]] from my Judge. [[H8199]] 
8 If [[H2005]] I go [[H1980]] east, [[H6924]] He is not there, [[H369]] and if I go west, [[H268]] I cannot [[H3808]] find [[H995]] Him.  
9 When He is at work [[H6213]] in the north, [[H8040]] I cannot [[H3808]] behold [Him]; [[H2372]] when He turns [[H5848]] to the south, [[H3225]] I cannot [[H3808]] see [Him]. [[H7200]] 
10 Yet [[H3588]] He knows [[H3045]] the way I have taken; [[H1870]] when He has tested me, [[H974]] I will come forth [[H3318]] as gold. [[H2091]] 
11 My feet [[H7272]] have followed [[H270]] in His tracks; [[H838]] I have kept [[H8104]] His way [[H1870]] without [[H3808]] turning aside. [[H5186]] 
12 I have not [[H3808]] departed [[H4185]] from the command [[H4687]] of His lips; [[H8193]] I have treasured [[H6845]] the words [[H561]] of His mouth [[H6310]] more than my daily bread. [[H2706]] 
13 But He is unchangeable, [[H1931]] and who [[H4310]] can oppose Him? [[H7725]] He does [[H6213]] what He [[H5315]] desires. [[H183]] 
14 For [[H3588]] He carries out [[H7999]] His decree against me, [[H2706]] and He has [[H5973]] many [[H7227]] such plans. [[H2007]] 
15 Therefore [[H5921]] I am terrified [[H926]] in His presence; [[H6440]] when I consider this, [[H995]] I fear [[H6342]] Him. [[H4480]] 
16 God [[H410]] has made my heart [[H3820]] faint; [[H7401]] the Almighty [[H7706]] has terrified me. [[H926]] 
17 Yet [[H3588]] I am not [[H3808]] silenced [[H6789]] by [[H6440]] the darkness, [[H2822]] by the thick darkness [[H652]] that covers [[H3680]] my face. [[H6440]]
