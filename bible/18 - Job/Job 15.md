# Job 15
[[Job 14|←]] • [[Job 16|→]]
1 Then Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite [[H8489]] replied: [[H6030]] 
2 “Does a wise [[H2450]] man answer [[H6030]] with empty [[H7307]] counsel [[H1847]] or fill [[H4390]] his belly [[H990]] with the hot east wind? [[H6921]] 
3 Should he argue [[H3198]] with useless [[H3808]] words [[H1697]] or speeches [[H4405]] that serve no [[H3808]] purpose? [[H3276]] 
4 But [[H637]] you [[H859]] even undermine [[H6565]] the fear [of God] [[H3374]] and hinder [[H1639]] meditation [[H7881]] before [[H6440]] Him. [[H410]] 
5 For [[H3588]] your iniquity [[H5771]] instructs [[H502]] your mouth, [[H6310]] and you choose [[H977]] the language [[H3956]] of the crafty. [[H6175]] 
6 Your own mouth [[H6310]] condemns you, [[H7561]] not [[H3808]] mine; [[H589]] your own lips [[H8193]] testify against you. [[H6030]] 
7 Were you the first [[H7223]] man [[H120]] ever born? [[H3205]] Were you brought forth [[H2342]] before [[H6440]] the hills? [[H1389]] 
8 Do you listen in [[H8085]] on God's [[H433]] council [[H5475]] or limit [[H1639]] wisdom [[H2451]] to yourself? [[H413]] 
9 What [[H4100]] do you know [[H3045]] that we do not? [[H3808]] What do you understand [[H995]] that is not [[H3808]] clear to us? [[H5973]] 
10 Both [[H1571]] the gray-haired [[H7867]] and [[H1571]] the aged [[H3453]] are on our side—  men much older [[H3524]] than your father. [[H1]] 
11 Are the consolations [[H8575]] of God [[H410]] not enough [[H4592]] for you, [[H4480]] even words [[H1697]] [spoken] gently [[H328]] to you? [[H5973]] 
12 Why [[H4100]] has your heart [[H3820]] carried you away, [[H3947]] and why [[H4100]] do your eyes [[H5869]] flash, [[H7335]] 
13 as [[H3588]] you turn [[H7725]] your spirit [[H7307]] against [[H413]] God [[H410]] and pour such words [[H4405]] out of [[H3318]] your mouth? [[H6310]] 
14 What [[H4100]] is man, [[H582]] that [[H3588]] he should be pure, [[H2135]] or one born [[H3205]] of woman, [[H802]] that [[H3588]] he should be righteous? [[H6663]] 
15 If [[H2005]] God puts no [[H3808]] trust [[H539]] in His holy ones, [[H6918]] if even the heavens [[H8064]] are not [[H3808]] pure [[H2141]] in His eyes, [[H5869]] 
16 how much less [[H637]] man, [[H376]] who is vile [[H8581]] and corrupt, [[H444]] who drinks [[H8354]] injustice [[H5766]] like water? [[H4325]] 
17 Listen [[H8085]] to me  and I will inform you. [[H2331]] I will describe [[H5608]] what [[H2088]] I have seen, [[H2372]] 
18 what [[H834]] was declared [[H5046]] by wise men [[H2450]] and was not [[H3808]] concealed [[H3582]] from their fathers, [[H1]] 
19 to whom  alone [[H905]] the land [[H776]] was given [[H5414]] when no [[H3808]] foreigner [[H2114]] passed [[H5674]] among them: [[H8432]] 
20 A wicked [[H7563]] man writhes in pain [[H2342]] all [[H3605]] his [[H1931]] days; [[H3117]] only a few [[H4557]] years [[H8141]] are reserved [[H6845]] for the ruthless. [[H6184]] 
21 Sounds [[H6963]] of terror [[H6343]] fill his ears; [[H241]] in his prosperity [[H7965]] the destroyer [[H7703]] attacks him. [[H935]] 
22 He despairs of [[H539]] his return [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] darkness; [[H2822]] he [[H1931]] is marked [[H6822]] for [[H413]] the sword. [[H2719]] 
23 He [[H1931]] wanders about [[H5074]] as food [[H3899]] for vultures; [[H344]] he knows [[H3045]] the day [[H3117]] of darkness [[H2822]] is at hand. [[H3027]] 
24 Distress [[H6862]] and anguish [[H4691]] terrify him, [[H1204]] overwhelming him [[H8630]] like a king [[H4428]] poised [[H6264]] to attack. [[H3593]] 
25 For [[H3588]] he has stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] against [[H413]] God [[H410]] and has vaunted himself [[H1396]] against [[H413]] the Almighty, [[H7706]] 
26 rushing [[H7323]] headlong [[H6677]] at Him [[H413]] with his thick, [[H5672]] studded [[H1354]] shield. [[H4043]] 
27 Though [[H3588]] his face [[H6440]] is covered [[H3680]] with fat [[H2459]] and his waistline [[H3689]] bulges [[H6213]] with flesh, [[H6371]] 
28 he will dwell [[H7931]] in ruined [[H3582]] cities, [[H5892]] in abandoned [[H3808]] houses [[H1004]] destined [[H6257]] to crumble. [[H1530]] 
29 He will no [[H3808]] longer be rich; [[H6238]] his wealth [[H2428]] will not [[H3808]] endure. [[H6965]] His possessions [[H4512]] will not [[H3808]] spread over [[H5186]] the land. [[H776]] 
30 He will not [[H3808]] escape [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] the darkness; [[H2822]] the flame [[H7957]] will wither [[H3001]] his shoots, [[H3127]] and the breath [[H7307]] of God’s mouth [[H6310]] will carry him away. [[H5493]] 
31 Let him not [[H408]] deceive himself [[H8582]] with trust [[H539]] in emptiness, [[H7723]] for [[H3588]] emptiness [[H7723]] will be [[H1961]] his reward. [[H8545]] 
32 It will be paid in full [[H4390]] before [[H3808]] his time, [[H3117]] and his branch [[H3712]] will not [[H3808]] flourish. [[H7488]] 
33 He will be like a vine [[H1612]] stripped of [[H2554]] its unripe grapes, [[H1154]] and like an olive tree [[H2132]] that sheds [[H7993]] its blossoms. [[H5328]] 
34 For [[H3588]] the company [[H5712]] of the godless [[H2611]] [will be] barren, [[H1565]] and fire [[H784]] will consume [[H398]] the tents [[H168]] of bribery. [[H7810]] 
35 They conceive [[H2029]] trouble [[H5999]] and give birth to [[H3205]] evil; [[H205]] their womb [[H990]] prepares [[H3559]] deceit.” [[H4820]]
