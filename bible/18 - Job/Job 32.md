# Job 32
[[Job 31|←]] • [[Job 33|→]]
1 So these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] men [[H582]] stopped [[H7673]] answering [[H6030]] Job, [[H347]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was righteous [[H6662]] in his own eyes. [[H5869]] 
2 This kindled [[H2734]] the anger [[H639]] of Elihu [[H453]] son [[H1121]] of Barachel [[H1292]] the Buzite, [[H940]] of the family [[H4940]] of Ram, [[H7410]] who burned [[H2734]] with anger [[H639]] against Job [[H347]] for [[H5921]] justifying [[H6663]] himself [[H5315]] rather than God. [[H430]] 
3 And his anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against Job’s three [[H7969]] friends, [[H7453]] because [[H5921]] they had failed [[H3808]] to refute [Job], [[H4617]] and yet had condemned [[H7561]] him. [[H347]] 
4 Now Elihu [[H453]] had waited [[H2442]] to speak [[H1697]] to Job [[H347]] because [[H3588]] the others [[H1992]] were older [[H2205]] than he. [[H4480]] 
5 But when he [[H453]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the three [[H7969]] men [[H376]] had no [[H369]] further reply, [[H4617]] his anger [[H639]] was aroused. [[H2734]] 
6 So Elihu [[H453]] son [[H1121]] of Barachel [[H1292]] the Buzite [[H940]] declared: [[H6030]] “I [[H589]] am young [[H6810]] in years, [[H3117]] while you [[H859]] are old; [[H3453]] that is why [[H5921]] I was timid [[H2119]] and afraid [[H3372]] to tell you [[H2331]] what I know. [[H1843]] 
7 I thought [[H559]] that age [[H3117]] should speak, [[H1696]] and many [[H7230]] years [[H8141]] should teach [[H3045]] wisdom. [[H2451]] 
8 But [[H403]] [there is] [[H1931]] a spirit [[H7307]] in a man, [[H582]] the breath [[H5397]] of the Almighty, [[H7706]] that gives him understanding. [[H995]] 
9 It is not only [[H3808]] the old [[H7227]] who are wise, [[H2449]] or the elderly [[H2205]] who understand [[H995]] justice. [[H4941]] 
10 Therefore [[H3651]] I say, [[H559]] ‘Listen to me. [[H8085]] I [[H589]] too [[H637]] will declare [[H2331]] what I know.’ [[H1843]] 
11 Indeed, [[H2005]] I waited [[H3176]] while you spoke; [[H1697]] I listened [[H238]] to [[H5704]] your reasoning; [[H8394]] as [[H5704]] you searched [[H2713]] for words, [[H4405]] 
12 I paid you full attention. [[H995]] But no one [[H369]] proved Job [[H347]] wrong; [[H3198]] not one of [[H4480]] you rebutted [[H6030]] his arguments. [[H561]] 
13 So do not [[H6435]] claim, [[H559]] ‘We have found [[H4672]] wisdom; [[H2451]] let God, [[H410]] not [[H3808]] man, [[H376]] refute him.’ [[H5086]] 
14 But Job has not [[H3808]] directed [[H6186]] [his] words [[H4405]] against me, [[H413]] and I will not [[H3808]] answer him [[H7725]] with your arguments. [[H561]] 
15 Job’s friends are dismayed [[H2865]] and have no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] to say; [[H6030]] words [[H4405]] have escaped [[H6275]] them. [[H1992]] 
16 Must I wait [[H3176]] now that [[H3588]] they are silent, [[H3808]] now that [[H3588]] they stand [[H5975]] and no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] reply? [[H6030]] 
17 I [[H589]] too [[H637]] will answer; [[H6030]] yes, [[H637]] I [[H589]] will declare [[H2331]] what I know. [[H1843]] 
18 For [[H3588]] I am full of [[H4390]] words, [[H4405]] and my spirit [[H7307]] within me [[H990]] compels me. [[H6693]] 
19 Behold, [[H2009]] my belly [[H990]] is like unvented [[H3808]] wine; [[H3196]] it is about to burst [[H1234]] like a new [[H2319]] wineskin. [[H178]] 
20 I must speak [[H1696]] and find relief; [[H7304]] I must open [[H6605]] my lips [[H8193]] and respond. [[H6030]] 
21 I will be partial [[H5375]] to no [[H408]] one, [[H376]] nor will [[H3808]] I flatter [[H3655]] any man. [[H120]] 
22 For [[H3588]] I do not [[H3808]] know how [[H3045]] to flatter, [[H3655]] or my Maker [[H6213]] would remove me [[H5375]] in an instant. [[H4592]]
