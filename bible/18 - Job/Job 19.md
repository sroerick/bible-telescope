# Job 19
[[Job 18|←]] • [[Job 20|→]]
1 Then Job [[H347]] answered: [[H6030]] 
2 “How long [[H5704]] will you torment [[H3013]] me [[H5315]] and crush me [[H1792]] with words? [[H4405]] 
3 Ten [[H6235]] times [[H6471]] now, [[H2088]] you have reproached me; [[H3637]] you shamelessly [[H954]] mistreat [[H1970]] me.  
4 Even if [[H637]] I have truly gone astray, [[H7686]] my error [[H4879]] concerns [[H3885]] me alone. [[H854]] 
5 If [[H518]] indeed [[H551]] you would exalt [yourselves] [[H1431]] above me [[H5921]] and use my disgrace [[H2781]] against me, [[H5921]] 
6 then [[H645]] understand [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it is God [[H433]] who has wronged me [[H5791]] and drawn His net [[H4686]] around [[H5362]] me. [[H5921]] 
7 Though [[H2005]] I cry out, [[H6817]] ‘Violence!’ [[H2555]] I get no [[H3808]] response; [[H6030]] though I call for help, [[H7768]] there is no [[H369]] justice. [[H4941]] 
8 He has blocked [[H1443]] my way [[H734]] so I cannot [[H3808]] pass; [[H5674]] He has veiled [[H5921]] my paths [[H5410]] with darkness. [[H2822]] 
9 He has stripped [[H6584]] me of my honor [[H3519]] and removed [[H5493]] the crown [[H5850]] from my head. [[H7218]] 
10 He tears me down [[H5422]] on every side [[H5439]] until I am gone; [[H1980]] He uproots [[H5265]] my hope [[H8615]] like a tree. [[H6086]] 
11 His anger [[H639]] burns [[H2734]] against me, [[H5921]] and He counts me [[H2803]] among His enemies. [[H6862]] 
12 His troops [[H1416]] advance [[H935]] together; [[H3162]] they construct [[H5549]] a ramp [[H1870]] against me [[H5921]] and encamp [[H2583]] around [[H5439]] my tent. [[H168]] 
13 He has removed [[H7368]] my brothers [[H251]] from [[H4480]] me; [[H5921]] my acquaintances [[H3045]] have abandoned me. [[H2114]] 
14 My kinsmen [[H7138]] have failed me, [[H2308]] and my friends [[H3045]] have forgotten me. [[H7911]] 
15 My guests [[H1004]] and maidservants [[H519]] count me [[H2803]] as a stranger; [[H2114]] I am [[H1961]] a foreigner [[H5237]] in their sight. [[H5869]] 
16 I call [[H7121]] for my servant, [[H5650]] but he does not [[H3808]] answer, [[H6030]] though I implore [[H2603]] him  with [[H1119]] my own mouth. [[H6310]] 
17 My breath [[H7307]] is repulsive [[H2114]] to my wife, [[H802]] and I am loathsome [[H2603]] to my own family. [[H1121]] 
18 Even [[H1571]] little boys [[H5759]] scorn [[H3988]] me;  when I appear, [[H6965]] they deride [[H1696]] me.  
19 All [[H3605]] my best friends [[H4962]] despise me, [[H8581]] and those [[H2088]] I love [[H157]] have turned [[H2015]] against me.  
20 My skin [[H5785]] and flesh [[H1320]] cling [[H1692]] to my bones; [[H6106]] I have escaped [[H4422]] by the skin [[H5785]] of my teeth. [[H8127]] 
21 Have pity on me, [[H2603]] my friends, [[H7453]] have pity, [[H2603]] for [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of God [[H433]] has struck [[H5060]] me.  
22 Why [[H4100]] do you persecute [[H7291]] me as [[H3644]] God does? [[H410]] Will you never [[H3808]] get enough [[H7646]] of my flesh? [[H1320]] 
23 I wish [[H4310]] that my words [[H4405]] were recorded [[H3789]] and inscribed [[H2710]] in a book, [[H5612]] 
24 by an iron [[H1270]] stylus [[H5842]] on lead, [[H5777]] or chiseled [[H2672]] in stone [[H6697]] forever. [[H5703]] 
25 But I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] that my Redeemer [[H1350]] lives, [[H2416]] and that at the last [[H314]] He will stand [[H6965]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H6083]] 
26 Even after [[H310]] my skin [[H5785]] has been destroyed, [[H5362]] yet in my flesh [[H1320]] I will see [[H2372]] God. [[H433]] 
27 I [[H589]] will see [[H2372]] Him [[H834]] for myself;  my eyes [[H5869]] will behold Him, [[H7200]] and not [[H3808]] as a stranger. [[H2114]] How my heart [[H3629]] yearns [[H3615]] within me! [[H2436]] 
28 If [[H3588]] you say, [[H559]] ‘How [[H4100]] shall we persecute [[H7291]] him,  since the root [[H8328]] of the matter [[H1697]] lies [[H4672]] with him?’  
29 then you should fear [[H1481]] the sword [[H2719]] yourselves,  because [[H3588]] wrath [[H2534]] brings punishment [[H5771]] by the sword, [[H2719]] so that [[H4616]] you may know [[H3045]] [there is] a judgment.” [[H1779]]
