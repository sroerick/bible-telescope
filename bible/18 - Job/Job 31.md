# Job 31
[[Job 30|←]] • [[Job 32|→]]
1 I have made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with my eyes. [[H5869]] How then [[H4100]] could I gaze [with desire] [[H995]] at [[H5921]] a virgin? [[H1330]] 
2 For what [is] [[H4100]] the allotment [[H2506]] of God [[H433]] from above, [[H4605]] or the heritage [[H5159]] from the Almighty [[H7706]] on high? [[H4791]] 
3 Does not [[H3808]] disaster [[H343]] come to the unjust [[H5767]] and calamity [[H5235]] to workers [[H6466]] of iniquity? [[H205]] 
4 Does He [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my ways [[H1870]] and count [[H5608]] my every [[H3605]] step? [[H6806]] 
5 If [[H518]] I have walked [[H1980]] in [[H5973]] falsehood [[H7723]] or my foot [[H7272]] has rushed [[H2363]] to [[H5921]] deceit, [[H4820]] 
6 let God weigh me [[H8254]] with honest [[H6664]] scales, [[H3976]] and He [[H433]] will know [[H3045]] my integrity. [[H8538]] 
7 If [[H518]] my steps [[H838]] have turned [[H5186]] from [[H4480]] the path, [[H1870]] if my heart [[H3820]] has followed [[H310]] my eyes, [[H5869]] or impurity [[H3971]] has stuck [[H1692]] to my hands, [[H3709]] 
8 then may another [[H312]] eat [[H398]] what I have sown, [[H2232]] and my crops [[H6631]] be uprooted. [[H8327]] 
9 If [[H518]] my heart [[H3820]] has been enticed [[H6601]] by [[H5921]] my neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife, [[H802]] or I have lurked [[H693]] at [[H5921]] his door, [[H6607]] 
10 then may my own wife [[H802]] grind grain [[H2912]] for another, [[H312]] and may other men [[H312]] sleep [[H3766]] with her. [[H5921]] 
11 For [[H3588]] that [would be] [[H1931]] a heinous crime, [[H2154]] an iniquity [[H5771]] to be judged. [[H6414]] 
12 For [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is a fire [[H784]] that burns [[H398]] down to [[H5704]] Abaddon; [[H11]] it would root out [[H8327]] my entire [[H3605]] harvest. [[H8393]] 
13 If [[H518]] I have rejected [[H3988]] the cause [[H4941]] of my manservant [[H5650]] or maidservant [[H519]] when they made a complaint [[H7378]] against me, [[H5978]] 
14 what [[H4100]] will I do [[H6213]] when [[H3588]] God [[H410]] rises to judge? [[H6965]] How [[H4100]] will I answer [[H7725]] when [[H3588]] called to account? [[H6485]] 
15 Did not [[H3808]] He who made me [[H6213]] in the womb [[H990]] also make them? [[H6213]] Did not the same One [[H259]] form us [[H3559]] in the womb? [[H7358]] 
16 If [[H518]] I have denied [[H4513]] the desires [[H2656]] of the poor [[H1800]] or allowed the widow’s [[H490]] eyes [[H5869]] to fail, [[H3615]] 
17 if I have eaten [[H398]] my morsel [[H6595]] alone, [[H905]] not [[H3808]] sharing [[H398]] it [[H4480]] with the fatherless— [[H3490]] 
18 though [[H3588]] from my youth [[H5271]] I reared him [[H1431]] as would a father, [[H1]] and from my mother's [[H517]] womb [[H990]] I guided [the widow]— [[H5148]] 
19 if [[H518]] I have seen [[H7200]] one perish [[H6]] for lack [[H1097]] of clothing, [[H3830]] or a needy man [[H34]] without [[H369]] a cloak, [[H3682]] 
20 if [[H518]] his heart [[H2504]] has not [[H3808]] blessed me [[H1288]] for warming him [[H2552]] with the fleece [[H1488]] of my sheep, [[H3532]] 
21 if [[H518]] I have lifted [[H5130]] up my hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the fatherless [[H3490]] because [[H3588]] I saw [[H7200]] that I had support [[H5833]] in the gate, [[H8179]] 
22 then may my arm [[H248]] fall [[H5307]] from my shoulder [[H7929]] and be torn [[H7665]] from its socket. [[H7070]] 
23 For [[H3588]] calamity [[H343]] from God [[H410]] terrifies [[H6343]] me, [[H413]] and His splendor [[H7613]] I cannot [[H3808]] overpower. [[H3201]] 
24 If [[H518]] I have put [[H7760]] my trust [[H3689]] in gold [[H2091]] or called [[H559]] pure gold [[H3800]] my security, [[H4009]] 
25 if [[H518]] I have rejoiced [[H8055]] in [[H3588]] my great [[H7227]] wealth [[H2428]] because [[H3588]] my hand [[H3027]] had gained [[H4672]] so much, [[H3524]] 
26 if [[H518]] I have regarded [[H7200]] the sun [[H216]] in its radiance [[H1984]] or at the moon [[H3394]] moving [[H1980]] in splendor, [[H3368]] 
27 so that my heart [[H3820]] was secretly [[H5643]] enticed [[H6601]] and my hand [[H3027]] threw a kiss [[H5401]] from my mouth, [[H6310]] 
28 this [[H1931]] would also be [[H1571]] an iniquity [[H5771]] to be judged, [[H6416]] for [[H3588]] I would have denied [[H3584]] God [[H410]] on high. [[H4605]] 
29 If [[H518]] I have rejoiced [[H8055]] at my enemy’s [[H8130]] ruin, [[H6365]] or exulted [[H5782]] when [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] befell him— [[H4672]] 
30 I have not [[H3808]] allowed [[H5414]] my mouth [[H2441]] to sin [[H2398]] by asking for [[H7592]] his life [[H5315]] with a curse— [[H423]] 
31 if [[H518]] the men [[H4962]] of my house [[H168]] have not [[H3808]] said, [[H559]] ‘Who [[H4310]] is there [[H5414]] who has not [[H3808]] had his fill?’— [[H7646]] 
32 [but] no [[H3808]] stranger [[H1616]] had to lodge [[H3885]] on the street, [[H2351]] for my door [[H1817]] has been open [[H6605]] to the traveler— [[H734]] 
33 if [[H518]] I have covered [[H3680]] my transgressions [[H6588]] like Adam [[H121]] by hiding [[H2934]] my guilt [[H5771]] in my heart, [[H2243]] 
34 because [[H3588]] I greatly [[H7227]] feared [[H6206]] the crowds, [[H1995]] and the contempt [[H937]] of the clans [[H4940]] terrified me, [[H2865]] so that I kept silent [[H1826]] and would not [[H3808]] go outside— [[H3318]] 
35 Oh, that [[H4310]] I had [[H5414]] one to hear  me! [[H8085]] Here is [[H2005]] my signature— [[H8420]] let the Almighty [[H7706]] answer me; [[H6030]] let my accuser [[H376]] compose [[H3789]] His indictment. [[H5612]] 
36 Surely [[H518]] I would carry it [[H5375]] on [[H5921]] my shoulder [[H7926]] and wear [[H6029]] it like a crown. [[H5850]] 
37 I would give [[H5046]] account [[H4557]] of all my steps; [[H6806]] I would approach Him [[H7126]] like [[H3644]] a prince. [[H5057]] 
38 If [[H518]] my land [[H127]] cries out [[H2199]] against me [[H5921]] and its furrows [[H8525]] weep [[H1058]] together, [[H3162]] 
39 if [[H518]] I have devoured [[H398]] its produce [[H3581]] without [[H1097]] payment [[H3701]] or broken the spirit [[H5315]] of its tenants, [[H1167]] 
40 then let briers [[H2336]] grow [[H3318]] instead of [[H8478]] wheat [[H2406]] and stinkweed [[H890]] instead of [[H8478]] barley.” [[H8184]] Thus conclude [[H8552]] the words [[H1697]] of Job. [[H347]]
