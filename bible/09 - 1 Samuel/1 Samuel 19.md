1 Then Saul [[H7586]] ordered [[H1696]] his son [[H1121]] Jonathan [[H3129]] and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] to kill [[H4191]] David. [[H1732]] But Jonathan [[H3129]] delighted [[H2654]] greatly [[H3966]] in David, [[H1732]] 
2 so he [[H3083]] warned [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] “My father [[H1]] Saul [[H7586]] intends [[H1245]] to kill you. [[H4191]] Be on your guard [[H8104]] in the morning; [[H1242]] find [[H3427]] a secret place [[H5643]] and hide there. [[H2244]] 
3 I will [[H589]] go out [[H3318]] and stand [[H5975]] beside [[H3027]] my father [[H1]] in the field [[H7704]] where [[H834]] you [are], [[H859]] so I [[H589]] can ask [[H1696]] about you.  And if I find out [[H7200]] anything, [[H4100]] I will tell [[H5046]] you.”  
4 Then Jonathan [[H3083]] spoke [[H1696]] well [[H2896]] of David [[H1732]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] Saul [[H7586]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “The king [[H4428]] should not [[H408]] sin [[H2398]] against his servant [[H5650]] David; [[H1732]] he has not [[H3808]] sinned [[H2398]] against you.  In fact, [[H3588]] his actions [[H4639]] [have been] highly [[H3966]] beneficial [[H2896]] to you.  
5 He took [[H7760]] his life [[H5315]] in his hands [[H3709]] when he struck down [[H5221]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] and the LORD [[H3068]] worked [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] salvation [[H8668]] for all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] You saw [[H7200]] it and rejoiced, [[H8055]] so why [[H4100]] would you sin [[H2398]] against innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] by killing [[H4191]] David [[H1732]] for no reason? [[H2600]] 
6 Saul [[H7586]] listened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] and swore an oath: [[H7650]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] David will not [[H518]] be put to death.” [[H4191]] 
7 So Jonathan [[H3083]] summoned [[H7121]] David [[H1732]] and told [[H5046]] him  all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things. [[H1697]] Then Jonathan [[H3083]] brought [[H935]] David [[H1732]] to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] to serve [[H1961]] him [[H6440]] as he had before. [[H865]] 
8 When war [[H4421]] broke out [[H1961]] again, [[H3254]] David [[H1732]] went out [[H3318]] and fought [[H3898]] the Philistines [[H6430]] and struck [[H5221]] them  with such a mighty [[H1419]] blow [[H4347]] that they fled [[H5127]] before him. [[H6440]] 
9 But as Saul [[H1931]] was sitting [[H3427]] in his house [[H1004]] with his spear [[H2595]] in his hand, [[H3027]] a spirit [[H7307]] of distress [[H7451]] from the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H413]] him. [[H7586]] While David [[H1732]] was playing the harp, [[H5059]] 
10 Saul [[H7586]] tried [[H1245]] to pin [[H5221]] him [[H1732]] to the wall [[H7023]] with his spear. [[H2595]] But the spear [[H2595]] struck [[H5221]] the wall [[H7023]] and David [[H1732]] eluded [[H6362]] [him], [[H7586]] ran away, [[H5127]] and escaped [[H4422]] that [[H1931]] night. [[H3915]] 
11 Then Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] David’s [[H1732]] house [[H1004]] to watch him [[H8104]] and kill him [[H4191]] in the morning. [[H1242]] But David's wife [[H802]] Michal [[H4324]] warned [[H5046]] [him], [[H1732]] “If [[H518]] you do not [[H369]] run [[H4422]] for your life [[H5315]] tonight, [[H3915]] tomorrow [[H4279]] you [[H859]] will be dead! [[H4191]] 
12 So Michal [[H4324]] lowered [[H3381]] David [[H1732]] from [[H1157]] the window, [[H2474]] and he ran away [[H1272]] and escaped. [[H4422]] 
13 Then Michal [[H4324]] took [[H3947]] a household idol [[H8655]] and laid [it] [[H7760]] in [[H413]] the bed, [[H4296]] placed [[H7760]] some goat hair [[H3523]] on its head, [[H4763]] and covered [[H3680]] it with a garment. [[H899]] 
14 When Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] the messengers [[H4397]] to seize [[H3947]] David, [[H1732]] Michal said, [[H559]] “He [[H1931]] [is] ill.” [[H2470]] 
15 But Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] the messengers back [[H4397]] to see [[H7200]] David [[H1732]] and told them, [[H559]] “Bring [[H5927]] him [[H853]] up to me [[H413]] in his bed, [[H4296]] so I can kill him.” [[H4191]] 
16 And when the messengers [[H4397]] entered, [[H935]] there was [[H2009]] the idol [[H8655]] in [[H413]] the bed [[H4296]] with the quilt [[H3523]] of goats' [hair] [[H5795]] on its head. [[H4763]] 
17 And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to Michal, [[H4324]] “Why [[H4100]] did you deceive [[H7411]] me like this? [[H3602]] You have sent my enemy [[H341]] away, [[H7971]] and he has escaped!” [[H4422]] Michal [[H4324]] replied, [[H559]] “He [[H1931]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘Help me get away, [[H7971]] or [[H4100]] I will kill you!’” [[H4191]] 
18 So David [[H1732]] ran away [[H1272]] and escaped. [[H4422]] And he went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Samuel [[H8050]] at Ramah [[H7414]] and told [[H5046]] him  all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] had done [[H6213]] to him.  Then he [[H1931]] and Samuel [[H8050]] went [[H1980]] to Naioth  and stayed [[H3427]] [there]. [[H5121]] 
19 When it was reported [[H5046]] to Saul [[H7586]] that David [[H1732]] was at Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah, [[H7414]] 
20 he [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to capture [[H3947]] him. [[H1732]] But when they saw [[H7200]] the group [[H3862]] of prophets [[H5030]] prophesying, [[H5012]] with Samuel [[H8050]] leading them, [[H5324]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] them, [[H5921]] and Saul’s [[H7586]] messengers [[H4397]] also [[H1571]] began to prophesy. [[H5012]] 
21 When this was reported [[H5046]] to Saul, [[H7586]] he sent [[H7971]] more [[H312]] messengers, [[H4397]] but they [[H1992]] began to prophesy [[H5012]] as well. [[H1571]] So Saul [[H7586]] tried again [[H3254]] and sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] a third [time], [[H7992]] and even [[H1571]] they [[H1992]] began to prophesy. [[H5012]] 
22 Finally, Saul himself [[H1931]] left for [[H1980]] Ramah [[H7414]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the large [[H1419]] cistern [[H953]] at Secu, [[H7906]] where he asked, [[H7592]] “Where [[H375]] are Samuel [[H8050]] and David?” [[H1732]] “At Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah,” [[H7414]] he was told. [[H559]] 
23 So Saul went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah. [[H7414]] But the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] even [[H1571]] [Saul], [[H1931]] and he walked along [[H1980]] prophesying [[H5012]] until [[H5704]] he came to [[H935]] Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah. [[H7414]] 
24 Then Saul [[H1931]] stripped off [[H6584]] his robes [[H899]] and also [[H1571]] prophesied [[H5012]] before [[H6440]] Samuel. [[H8050]] And he collapsed [[H5307]] and lay naked [[H6174]] all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] and [[H3605]] night. [[H3915]] That is why [[H5921]] it is said, [[H559]] “Is Saul [[H7586]] also [[H1571]] among the prophets?” [[H5030]]
