[[1 Samuel 17|←]] • [[1 Samuel 19|→]]
1 After [[H1961]] David had finished [[H3615]] speaking [[H1696]] with [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] the souls [[H5315]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] and David [[H1732]] were knit together, [[H7194]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] loved him [[H157]] as himself. [[H5315]] 
2 And from that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Saul [[H7586]] kept David with him [[H3947]] and did not [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] him return [[H7725]] to his father’s [[H1]] house. [[H1004]] 
3 Then Jonathan [[H3083]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with David [[H1732]] because he loved [[H160]] him [[H853]] as himself. [[H5315]] 
4 And Jonathan [[H3083]] removed [[H6584]] the robe [[H4598]] he was wearing [[H5921]] and gave [[H5414]] it to David, [[H1732]] along with his tunic, [[H4055]] his sword, [[H2719]] his bow, [[H7198]] and his belt. [[H2290]] 
5 So David [[H1732]] marched out [[H3318]] [and] prospered [[H7919]] in everything [[H3605]] Saul [[H7586]] sent him to do, [[H7971]] and Saul [[H7586]] set him [[H7760]] over [[H5921]] the men [[H582]] of war. [[H4421]] And this was pleasing [[H3190]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] and of Saul's [[H7586]] officers [[H5650]] as well. [[H1571]] 
6 As the troops [[H1961]] were returning home [[H7725]] after David [[H1732]] had killed [[H5221]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] the women [[H802]] came out [[H3318]] of all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Israel [[H3478]] to meet [[H7122]] King [[H4428]] Saul [[H7586]] with singing [[H7891]] and dancing, [[H4246]] with joyful songs, [[H8057]] and with tambourines [[H8596]] and other musical instruments. [[H7991]] 
7 And as the women danced, [[H7832]] they sang out: [[H6030]] “Saul [[H7586]] has slain [[H5221]] [his] thousands, [[H505]] and David [[H1732]] his tens of thousands.” [[H7233]] 
8 And Saul [[H7586]] was furious [[H2734]] and resented [[H7489]] this [[H2088]] song. [[H1697]] “They have ascribed [[H5414]] tens of thousands [[H7233]] to David,” [[H1732]] he said, [[H559]] “but only [[H5414]] thousands [[H505]] to me.  What more [[H5750]] can he have  but [[H389]] the kingdom?” [[H4410]] 
9 And [[H1961]] from that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] forward [[H1973]] Saul [[H7586]] kept a jealous eye [[H5771]] on David. [[H1732]] 
10 The next day [[H4283]] a spirit [[H7307]] of distress [[H7451]] sent from God [[H430]] came [[H6743]] upon [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] and he prophesied [[H5012]] inside the [[H8432]] house [[H1004]] while David [[H1732]] played [the harp] [[H5059]] as usual. [[H3117]] Now Saul [[H7586]] was holding [[H3027]] a spear, [[H2595]] 
11 and he [[H7586]] hurled it, [[H2904]] thinking, [[H559]] “I will pin [[H5221]] David [[H1732]] to the wall.” [[H7023]] But David [[H1732]] eluded [[H5437]] him [[H6440]] twice. [[H6471]] 
12 So Saul [[H7586]] was afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] David, [[H1732]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with David [[H5973]] but [[H5973]] had departed [[H5493]] from Saul. [[H7586]] 
13 Therefore Saul [[H7586]] sent [David] away [[H5493]] and gave [[H7760]] him  command [[H8269]] of a thousand men. [[H505]] David led [[H3318]] the troops {out to battle} [[H5971]] and back, [[H935]] 
14 and he continued [[H1961]] to prosper [[H7919]] in all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] because the LORD [[H3068]] was with him. [[H5973]] 
15 When Saul [[H7586]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H834]] David [[H1931]] was very [[H3966]] successful, [[H7919]] he was afraid [[H1481]] of him. [[H6440]] 
16 But all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah [[H3063]] loved [[H157]] David, [[H1732]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was leading them out to battle [[H3318]] and back. [[H935]] 
17 Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to David, [[H1732]] “Here [[H2009]] is my oldest [[H1419]] daughter [[H1323]] Merab. [[H4764]] I will give her [[H5414]] to you  in marriage. [[H802]] Only [[H389]] be [[H1961]] valiant [[H2428]] for me  and fight [[H3898]] the LORD's [[H3068]] battles.” [[H4421]] But Saul [[H7586]] was thinking, [[H559]] “I need not raise [[H1961]] my hand [[H3027]] against him;  let the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] be [[H1961]] against him.”  
18 And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] “Who [[H4310]] am I, [[H595]] and what [[H4310]] is my family [[H2416]] or my father’s [[H1]] clan [[H4940]] in Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H3588]] I should become [[H1961]] the son-in-law [[H2860]] of the king?” [[H4428]] 
19 So when it was [[H1961]] time [[H6256]] to give [[H5414]] Saul’s [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] Merab [[H4764]] to David, [[H1732]] she [[H1931]] was given [[H5414]] in marriage [[H802]] to Adriel [[H5741]] of Meholah. [[H4259]] 
20 Now Saul’s [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] Michal [[H4324]] loved [[H157]] David, [[H1732]] and when this was reported [[H5046]] to Saul, [[H7586]] it [[H1697]] pleased [[H3474]] him. [[H5869]] 
21 “I will give her [[H5414]] to [David],”  Saul [[H7586]] thought, [[H559]] “so that she may be [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] to him,  and the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] may be [[H1961]] against him.”  So Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “For a second [time] [[H8147]] now [[H3117]] you can be my son-in-law.” [[H2859]] 
22 Then Saul [[H7586]] ordered [[H6680]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] privately [[H3909]] and tell him, [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] is pleased with you, [[H2654]] and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] love you. [[H157]] Now therefore, [[H6258]] become his [[H4428]] son-in-law.’” [[H2859]] 
23 But when Saul's [[H7586]] servants [[H5650]] relayed these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to David, [[H1732]] he [[H1732]] replied, [[H559]] “Does it seem trivial [[H7043]] in your sight [[H5869]] to be the son-in-law [[H2859]] of the king? [[H4428]] I [[H595]] am a poor [[H7326]] man [[H376]] and lightly esteemed.” [[H7034]] 
24 And the servants [[H5650]] told [[H5046]] Saul [[H7586]] what [[H428]] David [[H1732]] had said. [[H1696]] 
25 Saul [[H7586]] replied, [[H559]] “Say [[H559]] to David, [[H1732]] ‘The king [[H4428]] desires [[H2656]] no [[H369]] other dowry [[H4119]] but [[H3588]] a hundred [[H3967]] Philistine [[H6430]] foreskins [[H6190]] as revenge [[H5358]] on his [[H4428]] enemies.’” [[H341]] But Saul [[H7586]] intended [[H2803]] to cause David’s [[H1732]] death [[H5307]] at the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] 
26 When the servants [[H5650]] reported [[H5046]] these [[H428]] terms [[H1697]] to David, [[H1732]] he [[H1732]] was pleased [[H3474]] to become the king’s [[H4428]] son-in-law. [[H2859]] Before the wedding day arrived, [[H3117]] 
27 David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] went out [[H1980]] and killed [[H5221]] two hundred [[H3967]] Philistines. [[H6430]] He [[H1732]] brought [[H935]] their foreskins [[H6190]] and presented them as payment in full [[H4390]] to become [[H4428]] the king's [[H4428]] son-in-law. [[H2859]] Then Saul [[H7586]] gave [[H5414]] his daughter [[H1323]] Michal [[H4324]] to David {in marriage}. [[H802]] 
28 When Saul [[H7586]] realized [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] was with [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] and that his [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] Michal [[H4324]] loved [David], [[H157]] 
29 he [[H7586]] grew even more [[H3254]] afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] David. [[H1732]] So from then on [[H3605]] Saul [[H7586]] was [[H1961]] David’s [[H1732]] enemy. [[H341]] 
30 Every time [[H1767]] the Philistine [[H6430]] commanders [[H8269]] came out [for battle], [[H3318]] David [[H1732]] was more successful [[H7919]] than all [[H3605]] of Saul’s [[H7586]] officers, [[H5650]] so that his name [[H8034]] was highly [[H3966]] esteemed. [[H3365]]
