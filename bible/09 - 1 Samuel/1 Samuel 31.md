# 1 Samuel 31
[[1 Samuel 30|←]] • [[2 Samuel 1|→]]
1 Now the Philistines [[H6430]] fought [[H3898]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] them, [[H6430]] and many fell [[H5307]] slain [[H2491]] on Mount [[H2022]] Gilboa. [[H1533]] 
2 The Philistines [[H6430]] followed hard after [[H1692]] Saul [[H7586]] and his sons, [[H1121]] and they killed [[H5221]] Saul’s [[H7586]] sons [[H1121]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] Abinadab, [[H41]] and Malchishua. [[H4444]] 
3 When the battle [[H4421]] intensified [[H3513]] against [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] the archers [[H3384]] overtook him [[H4672]] and wounded him [[H2342]] critically. [[H3966]] 
4 Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to his armor-bearer, [[H5375]] “Draw [[H8025]] your sword [[H2719]] and run it through me, [[H1856]] or [[H6435]] these [[H428]] uncircumcised men [[H6189]] will come [[H935]] and run me through [[H1856]] and torture [[H5953]] me!”  But the armor-bearer [[H5375]] refused, [[H14]] because [[H3588]] he was terrified. [[H3372]] So Saul [[H7586]] took [[H3947]] his own sword [[H2719]] and fell [[H5307]] on it. [[H5921]] 
5 When his armor-bearer [[H5375]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] was dead, [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] his own sword [[H2719]] and died [[H4191]] with him. [[H5973]] 
6 So on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] Saul [[H7586]] died [[H4191]] together [[H3162]] with his three [[H7969]] sons, [[H1121]] his armor-bearer, [[H5375]] and [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] his men. [[H376]] 
7 When the Israelites [[H376]] along [[H5676]] the valley [[H6010]] and those on the other side [[H5676]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the army [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] had fled [[H5127]] and that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] and his sons [[H1121]] had died, [[H4191]] they abandoned [[H5800]] their cities [[H5892]] and ran away. [[H5127]] So the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H935]] and occupied [[H3427]] them.  
8 The next day, [[H4283]] when the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H935]] to strip [[H6584]] the dead, [[H2491]] they found [[H4672]] Saul [[H7586]] and his three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] fallen [[H5307]] on Mount [[H2022]] Gilboa. [[H1533]] 
9 They cut off [[H3772]] Saul’s head, [[H7218]] stripped off [[H6584]] his armor, [[H3627]] and sent [[H7971]] messengers throughout the land [[H776]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] to proclaim the news [[H1319]] in the temples [[H1004]] of their idols [[H6091]] and among their people. [[H5971]] 
10 They put [[H7760]] his armor [[H3627]] in the temple [[H1004]] of the Ashtoreths [[H6252]] and hung [[H8628]] his body [[H1472]] on the wall [[H2346]] of Beth-shan. [[H1052]] 
11 When the people [[H3427]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] heard [[H8085]] what [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had done [[H6213]] to Saul, [[H7586]] 
12 all [[H3605]] their valiant warriors [[H376]] set out, [[H6965]] journeyed [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] night, [[H3915]] and retrieved [[H3947]] the bodies [[H1472]] of Saul [[H7586]] [and] [[H1472]] his sons [[H1121]] from the wall [[H2346]] of  Beth-shan. [[H1052]] When they arrived [[H935]] at Jabesh, [[H3003]] they burned [[H8313]] the bodies there. [[H8033]] 
13 Then they took [[H3947]] their bones [[H6106]] and buried [[H6912]] them under [[H8478]] the tamarisk tree [[H815]] in Jabesh, [[H3003]] and they fasted [[H6684]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]]
