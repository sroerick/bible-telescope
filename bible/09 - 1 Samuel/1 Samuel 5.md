# 1 Samuel 5
[[1 Samuel 4|←]] • [[1 Samuel 6|→]]
1 After the Philistines [[H6430]] had captured [[H3947]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] they took it [[H935]] from  Ebenezer [[H72]] to Ashdod, [[H795]] 
2 carried it into [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] of Dagon, [[H1712]] and set [[H3322]] it [[H853]] beside [[H681]] [his statue]. [[H1712]] 
3 When the people of Ashdod [[H796]] got up early [[H7925]] the next morning, [[H4283]] there [[H2009]] was Dagon, [[H1712]] fallen [[H5307]] on his face [[H6440]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] So they took [[H3947]] Dagon [[H1712]] and returned [[H7725]] him [[H853]] to his place. [[H4725]] 
4 But when they got up early [[H7925]] the next [[H4283]] morning, [[H1242]] there [[H2009]] was Dagon, [[H1712]] fallen [[H5307]] on his face [[H6440]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] with his head [[H7218]] [and] [[H3709]] his hands [[H3027]] broken off [[H3772]] and lying on [[H413]] the threshold. [[H4670]] Only [[H7535]] [the torso] [[H1712]] remained. [[H7604]] 
5 That is why, [[H5921]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] the priests [[H3548]] of Dagon [[H1712]] and everyone [[H3605]] who enters [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] of Dagon [[H1712]] in Ashdod [[H795]] do not [[H3808]] step [[H1869]] on [[H5921]] the threshold. [[H4670]] 
6 Now the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was heavy [[H3513]] on [[H413]] the people of Ashdod [[H796]] and its vicinity, [[H1366]] ravaging them [[H8074]] and afflicting [[H5221]] them [[H853]] with tumors. [[H6076]] 
7 And when the men [[H582]] of Ashdod [[H795]] saw [[H7200]] what was happening, [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] “The ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] must not [[H3808]] stay [[H3427]] here with us, [[H5973]] because [[H3588]] His hand [[H3027]] is heavy [[H7185]] upon us [[H5921]] and upon [[H5921]] our god [[H430]] Dagon.” [[H1712]] 
8 So they called together [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the rulers [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] and asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] with the ark [[H727]] of the God of [[H430]] Israel?” [[H3478]] “[It] [[H727]] must be moved [[H5437]] to Gath,” [[H1661]] they replied. [[H559]] So they carried away [[H5437]] the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
9 But after [[H310]] they had moved [[H5437]] [the ark to Gath], [[H853]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] hand [[H3027]] was also [[H1961]] against that city, [[H5892]] throwing it into great confusion [[H4103]] and afflicting [[H5221]] the men [[H376]] of the city, [[H5892]] both young [[H6996]] and [[H5704]] old, [[H1419]] with an outbreak [[H8368]] of tumors. [[H6076]] 
10 So they sent [[H7971]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] to Ekron, [[H6138]] but as it [[H727]] arrived, [[H935]] the Ekronites [[H6139]] cried out, [[H2199]] “They have brought [[H5437]] us [[H413]] the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] in order to kill us [[H4191]] and [[H853]] our people!” [[H5971]] 
11 Then [the Ekronites] assembled [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the rulers [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] and said, [[H559]] “Send away [[H7971]] the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] It must return [[H7725]] to its place, [[H4725]] so that it will not [[H3808]] kill [[H4191]] us [[H853]] and our people!” [[H5971]] For [[H3588]] a deadly [[H4194]] confusion [[H4103]] had pervaded [[H1961]] the city; [[H5892]] the hand [[H3027]] of God [[H430]] was heavy [[H3513]] upon it. [[H8033]] 
12 Those [[H376]] who [[H834]] did not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] were afflicted [[H5221]] with tumors, [[H6076]] and the outcry [[H7775]] of the city [[H5892]] went up [[H5927]] to heaven. [[H8064]]
