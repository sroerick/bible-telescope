# 1 Samuel 13
[[1 Samuel 12|←]] • [[1 Samuel 14|→]]
1 Saul [[H7586]] was [thirty] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] [forty]-two [[H8147]] years. [[H8141]] 
2 He chose [[H977]] for himself  three [[H7969]] thousand [men] [[H505]] of Israel: [[H3478]] Two thousand [[H505]] were [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Saul [[H7586]] at Michmash [[H4363]] and in the hill country [[H2022]] of Bethel, [[H1008]] and a thousand [[H505]] were [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Jonathan [[H3129]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]] And the rest [[H3499]] of the troops [[H5971]] he sent away, [[H7971]] each [[H376]] to his own [home]. [[H168]] 
3 Then Jonathan [[H3129]] attacked [[H5221]] the Philistine [[H6430]] outpost [[H5333]] at Geba, [[H1387]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] heard [about it]. [[H8085]] So Saul [[H7586]] blew [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] throughout [[H3605]] the land, [[H776]] saying, [[H559]] “Let the Hebrews [[H5680]] hear!” [[H8085]] 
4 And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]] the news: [[H559]] “Saul [[H7586]] has attacked [[H5221]] an outpost [[H5333]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and now [[H1571]] Israel [[H3478]] has become a stench [[H887]] to the Philistines!” [[H6430]] Then the people [[H5971]] were summoned [[H6817]] to join Saul [[H7586]] at Gilgal. [[H1537]] 
5 Now the Philistines [[H6430]] assembled [[H622]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Israel [[H3478]] with three [[H7970]] thousand [[H505]] chariots, [[H7393]] six [[H8337]] thousand [[H505]] horsemen, [[H6571]] and troops [[H5971]] as numerous [[H7230]] as the sand [[H2344]] on [[H5921]] the seashore. [[H8193]] They went up [[H5927]] and camped [[H2583]] at Michmash, [[H4363]] east [[H6926]] of  Beth-aven. [[H1007]] 
6 Seeing [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they were  in danger [[H6862]] because [[H3588]] their troops [[H5971]] were hard-pressed, [[H5065]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] hid [[H2244]] in caves [[H4631]] and thickets, [[H2336]] among the rocks, [[H5553]] and in cellars [[H6877]] and cisterns. [[H953]] 
7 Some Hebrews [[H5680]] even crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] into the land [[H776]] of Gad [[H1410]] and Gilead. [[H1568]] Saul, however, [[H7586]] remained [[H5750]] at Gilgal, [[H1537]] and all [[H3605]] his troops [[H5971]] were quaking with fear. [[H2729]] 
8 And [Saul] waited [[H3176]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] for the time appointed [[H4150]] by [[H834]] Samuel, [[H8050]] but Samuel [[H8050]] did not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] to Gilgal, [[H1537]] and the troops [[H5971]] began to desert [[H6327]] [Saul]. [[H5921]] 
9 So [he] [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] “Bring [[H5066]] me the burnt offering [[H5930]] and the peace offerings.” [[H8002]] And he offered up [[H5927]] the burnt offering. [[H5930]] 
10 Just as he finished [[H3615]] offering [[H5927]] the burnt offering, [[H5930]] Samuel [[H8050]] arrived, [[H935]] and Saul [[H7586]] went out [[H3318]] to greet him. [[H1288]] 
11 “What [[H4100]] have you done?” [[H6213]] Samuel [[H8050]] asked. [[H559]] And Saul [[H7586]] replied, [[H559]] “When [[H3588]] I saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the troops [[H5971]] were deserting [[H5310]] me, [[H5921]] and that you [[H859]] did not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] at the appointed [[H4150]] time [[H3117]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] were gathering [[H622]] at Michmash, [[H4363]] 
12 I thought, [[H559]] ‘Now [[H6258]] the Philistines [[H6430]] will descend [[H3381]] upon me [[H413]] at Gilgal, [[H1537]] and I have not [[H3808]] sought [[H2470]] the favor [[H6440]] of the LORD.’ [[H3068]] So I felt compelled [[H662]] to offer [[H5927]] the burnt offering.” [[H5930]] 
13 “You have acted foolishly,” [[H5528]] Samuel [[H8050]] declared. [[H559]] “You have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the command [[H4687]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] gave you; [[H6680]] if you had, [[H6258]] the LORD [[H3068]] would have established [[H3559]] your kingdom [[H4467]] over [[H413]] Israel [[H3478]] for [[H5704]] all time. [[H5769]] 
14 But now [[H6258]] your kingdom [[H4467]] will not [[H3808]] endure; [[H6965]] the LORD [[H3069]] has sought [[H1245]] a man [[H376]] after His own heart [[H3824]] and appointed him [[H6680]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] His people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] you have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the command [[H6680]] of the LORD.” [[H3069]] 
15 Then Samuel [[H8050]] set out [[H6965]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal [[H1537]] and went [[H5927]] up to Gibeah [[H1390]] in Benjamin. [[H1144]] And Saul [[H7586]] numbered [[H6485]] the troops [[H5971]] who were with him, [[H5973]] about six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men. [[H376]] 
16 Now Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan [[H3129]] his son [[H1121]] and the troops [[H5971]] with them [[H5973]] were staying [[H3427]] in Geba [[H1387]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] while the Philistines [[H6430]] camped [[H2583]] at Michmash. [[H4363]] 
17 And raiders [[H7843]] went out [[H3318]] of the Philistine [[H6430]] camp [[H4264]] in three [[H7969]] divisions. [[H7218]] One [[H259]] headed [[H6437]] toward [[H413]] Ophrah [[H6084]] in the land [[H776]] of Shual, [[H7777]] 
18 another [[H259]] toward Beth-horon, [[H1032]] and the [third] [[H7218]] down the border [[H1366]] road [[H1870]] overlooking [[H8259]] the Valley of Zeboim [[H1516]] facing the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
19 And no [[H3808]] blacksmith [[H2796]] could be found [[H4672]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H3588]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had said, [[H559]] “The Hebrews [[H5680]] must not be allowed [[H6435]] to make [[H6213]] swords [[H2719]] or [[H176]] spears.” [[H2595]] 
20 Instead, all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] would go down [[H3381]] to the Philistines [[H6430]] to sharpen [[H3913]] their plowshares, [[H4282]] mattocks, [[H855]] axes, [[H7134]] and sickles. [[H4281]] 
21 The charge [[H6477]] was [[H1961]] a pim [[H6310]] for the plowshares [[H4281]] and mattocks, [[H855]] and a third [of a pim] [[H7969]] for the pitchforks [[H7053]] and axes [[H7134]] and for repointing [[H5324]] an oxgoad. [[H1861]] 
22 So [[H1961]] on the day [[H3117]] of battle [[H4421]] not [[H3808]] a sword [[H2719]] or spear [[H2595]] could be found [[H4672]] in the hands [[H3027]] of the troops [[H5971]] with [[H854]] Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan; [[H3129]] only Saul [[H7586]] and his son [[H1121]] Jonathan had weapons. [[H3129]] 
23 And a garrison [[H4673]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] had gone out [[H3318]] to the pass [[H4569]] at Michmash. [[H4363]]
