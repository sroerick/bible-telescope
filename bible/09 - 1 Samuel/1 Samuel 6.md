# 1 Samuel 6
[[1 Samuel 5|←]] • [[1 Samuel 7|→]]
1 When the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had been [[H1961]] in the land [[H7704]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] for seven [[H7651]] months, [[H2320]] 
2 the Philistines [[H6430]] summoned [[H7121]] the priests [[H3548]] and diviners, [[H7080]] saying, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] with the ark [[H727]] of the LORD? [[H3068]] Tell [[H3045]] us how [[H4100]] to send it back [[H7971]] to its place.” [[H4725]] 
3 They replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you return [[H7971]] the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] do not [[H408]] send it away [[H7971]] empty, [[H7387]] but [[H3588]] by all means [[H7725]] return [it] [[H7725]] to Him  with a guilt offering. [[H817]] Then [[H227]] you will be healed, [[H7495]] and you will understand [[H3045]] why [[H4100]] His hand [[H3027]] has not [[H3808]] been lifted [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] you.  
4 “What [[H4100]] guilt offering [[H817]] should we send back to Him?” [[H7725]] asked the Philistines. [[H559]] “Five [[H2568]] gold [[H2091]] tumors [[H6076]] and five [[H2568]] gold [[H2091]] rats,” [[H5909]] they said, [[H559]] “[according to] the number [[H4557]] of rulers [[H5633]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] since [[H3588]] the same [[H259]] plague [has struck] [[H4046]] both you [[H3605]] and your rulers. [[H5633]] 
5 Make [[H6213]] images [[H6754]] of your tumors [[H6076]] and of the rats [[H5909]] that are ravaging [[H7843]] the land. [[H776]] Give [[H5414]] glory [[H3519]] to the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and perhaps [[H194]] He will lift [[H7043]] His hand [[H3027]] from you [[H5921]] and [[H5921]] your gods [[H430]] and [[H5921]] your land. [[H776]] 
6 Why [[H4100]] harden [[H3513]] your hearts [[H3824]] as [[H834]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] and Pharaoh [[H6547]] hardened [[H3513]] theirs? [[H3820]] When [[H834]] He afflicted them, [[H5953]] did they not [[H3808]] send the people on their way [[H7971]] as they departed? [[H1980]] 
7 Now, therefore, [[H6258]] prepare [[H6213]] one [[H259]] new [[H2319]] cart [[H5699]] with two [[H8147]] milk [[H5763]] cows [[H6510]] that [[H834]] have never [[H3808]] been yoked. [[H5927]] Hitch [[H631]] the cows [[H6510]] to the cart, [[H5699]] but take their calves [[H1121]] away [[H7725]] and pen them up. [[H1004]] 
8 Take [[H3947]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] set [[H5414]] it [[H853]] on [[H413]] the cart, [[H5699]] and [[H853]] in a chest [[H712]] beside it [[H6654]] put [[H7760]] the gold [[H2091]] objects [[H3627]] you are sending [[H7725]] Him  as a guilt offering. [[H817]] Then send [[H7971]] [the ark] [[H853]] on its way, [[H1980]] 
9 but keep watching it. [[H7200]] If [[H518]] it goes up [[H5927]] the road [[H1870]] to its homeland, [[H1366]] toward Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] it is the LORD [[H1931]] who has brought [[H6213]] on us  this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] disaster. [[H7451]] But if [[H518]] it does not, [[H3808]] then we will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it was not [[H3808]] His hand [[H3027]] that punished [[H5060]] us  and that it [[H1931]] happened [[H1961]] by chance. [[H4745]] 
10 So the men [[H376]] did [[H6213]] [as instructed]. [[H3651]] They took [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] milk [[H5763]] cows, [[H6510]] hitched [[H631]] them to the cart, [[H5699]] and penned up [[H3607]] their calves. [[H1121]] 
11 Then they put [[H7760]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] on [[H413]] the cart, [[H5699]] along with the box [[H712]] containing the gold [[H2091]] rats [[H5909]] and the images [[H6754]] of the tumors. [[H2914]] 
12 And the cows [[H6510]] headed straight [[H3474]] up the road [[H1870]] toward [[H5921]] Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] staying on that one [[H259]] highway [[H4546]] and lowing [[H1600]] as they went, [[H1980]] never [[H3808]] straying [[H5493]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left. [[H8040]] The rulers [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] followed [[H1980]] behind [[H310]] them to [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of  Beth-shemesh. [[H1053]] 
13 Now [the people of] Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] were harvesting [[H7114]] wheat [[H2406]] in the valley, [[H6010]] and when they looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] the ark, [[H727]] they were overjoyed [[H8055]] at the sight. [[H7200]] 
14 The cart [[H5699]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the field [[H7704]] of Joshua [[H3091]] of Beth-shemesh [[H1030]] and stopped [[H5975]] there [[H8033]] near a large [[H1419]] rock. [[H68]] The people chopped up [[H1234]] the cart [[H5699]] and offered [[H5927]] the cows [[H6510]] as a burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 And the Levites [[H3881]] took down [[H3381]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H854]] the box [[H712]] containing [[H834]] the gold [[H2091]] objects, [[H3627]] and they placed [[H7760]] them on [[H413]] the large [[H1419]] rock. [[H68]] That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the men [[H376]] of Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and made [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
16 And when the five [[H2568]] rulers [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] had seen [this], [[H7200]] they returned [[H7725]] to Ekron [[H6138]] that same [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]] 
17 As a guilt offering [[H817]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had sent back [[H7725]] one [[H259]] gold [[H2091]] tumor [for each city]: [[H2914]] Ashdod, [[H795]] Gaza, [[H5804]] Ashkelon, [[H831]] Gath, [[H1661]] and Ekron. [[H6138]] 
18 The number of gold [[H2091]] rats [[H5909]] also corresponded to the number [[H4557]] of Philistine [[H6430]] cities [[H5892]] [belonging] to the five [[H2568]] rulers— [[H5633]] the fortified [[H4013]] cities [[H5892]] and their outlying [[H6521]] villages. [[H3724]] And [[H5704]] to this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] the large [[H1419]] rock [[H59]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] they placed [[H3240]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is in the field [[H7704]] of Joshua [[H3091]] of Beth-shemesh. [[H1030]] 
19 But God struck down [[H5221]] some of the people  of Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] because [[H3588]] they looked [[H7200]] inside the ark [[H727]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] He struck down [[H5221]] seventy [[H7657]] men, [[H376]] and the people mourned [[H56]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had struck [[H5221]] them [[H5971]] with a great [[H1419]] slaughter. [[H4347]] 
20 The men [[H376]] of Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] asked, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] can [[H3201]] stand [[H5975]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] this [[H2088]] holy [[H6918]] God? [[H430]] To [[H413]] whom [[H4310]] should the ark go up [[H5927]] from here?” [[H5921]] 
21 So they sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] the people [[H3427]] of Kiriath-jearim, [[H7157]] saying, [[H559]] “The Philistines [[H6430]] have returned [[H7725]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Come down [[H3381]] [and] take it up [[H5927]] with you.” [[H413]]
