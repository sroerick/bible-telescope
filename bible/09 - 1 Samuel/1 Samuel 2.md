# 1 Samuel 2
[[1 Samuel 1|←]] • [[1 Samuel 3|→]]
1 At that time Hannah [[H2584]] prayed: [[H6419]] “My heart [[H3820]] rejoices [[H5970]] in the LORD [[H3068]] in [whom] [[H3068]] my horn [[H7161]] is exalted. [[H7311]] My mouth [[H6310]] speaks boldly [[H7337]] against [[H5921]] my enemies, [[H341]] for [[H3588]] I rejoice [[H8055]] in Your salvation. [[H3444]] 
2 There is no one [[H369]] holy [[H6918]] like the LORD. [[H3068]] Indeed, [[H3588]] [there is] no one [[H369]] besides You! [[H1115]] And there is no [[H369]] rock [[H6697]] like our God. [[H430]] 
3 Do not [[H408]] boast [[H7235]] so proudly, [[H1364]] or let arrogance [[H6277]] come [[H3318]] from your mouth, [[H6310]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is a God [[H410]] who knows, [[H1844]] and by Him [[H3808]] actions [[H5949]] are weighed. [[H8505]] 
4 The bows [[H7198]] of the warriors [[H1368]] are broken, [[H2844]] but the feeble [[H3782]] are equipped [[H247]] with strength. [[H2428]] 
5 The well-fed [[H7649]] hire themselves out [[H7936]] for food, [[H3899]] but the starving [[H7457]] hunger no more. [[H2308]] The barren woman [[H6135]] gives birth to [[H3205]] seven, [[H7651]] but she who has many [[H7227]] sons [[H1121]] pines away. [[H535]] 
6 The LORD [[H3068]] brings death [[H4191]] and gives life; [[H2421]] some He brings [[H3381]] down to Sheol, [[H7585]] and others He raises up. [[H5927]] 
7 The LORD [[H3068]] sends poverty [[H3423]] and wealth; [[H6238]] He humbles [[H8213]] and [[H637]] He exalts. [[H7311]] 
8 He raises [[H6965]] the poor [[H1800]] from the dust [[H6083]] and lifts [[H7311]] the needy [[H34]] from the ash heap. [[H830]] He seats [them] [[H3427]] among [[H5973]] princes [[H5081]] and bestows on them [[H5157]] a throne [[H3678]] of honor. [[H3519]] For [[H3588]] the foundations [[H4690]] of the earth [[H776]] are the LORD’s, [[H3068]] and upon them [[H5921]] He has set [[H7896]] the world. [[H8398]] 
9 He guards [[H8104]] the steps [[H7272]] of His faithful ones, [[H2623]] but the wicked [[H7563]] perish [[H1826]] in darkness; [[H2822]] for [[H3588]] by his own strength [[H3581]] shall no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] prevail. [[H1396]] 
10 Those who oppose [[H7378]] the LORD [[H3068]] will be shattered. [[H5181]] He will thunder [[H7481]] from heaven [[H8064]] against them. [[H5921]] The LORD [[H3068]] will judge [[H1777]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth [[H776]] and will give [[H5414]] power [[H5797]] to His king. [[H4428]] He will exalt [[H7311]] the horn [[H7161]] of His anointed.” [[H4899]] 
11 Then Elkanah [[H511]] went [[H1980]] home [[H1004]] to Ramah, [[H7414]] but the boy [[H5288]] began ministering [[H8334]] to [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] Eli [[H5941]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
12 Now the sons [[H1121]] of Eli [[H5941]] were wicked [[H1100]] men; [[H1121]] they had no [[H3808]] regard [[H3045]] for the LORD [[H3068]] 
13 or for the custom [[H4941]] of the priests [[H3548]] with [[H854]] the people. [[H5971]] When any [[H3605]] man [[H376]] offered [[H2076]] a sacrifice, [[H2077]] the servant [[H5288]] of the priest [[H3548]] would come [[H935]] with a three-pronged [[H7969]] meat fork [[H4207]] while the meat [[H1320]] was boiling [[H1310]] 
14 and plunge [it] [[H5221]] into the pan [[H3595]] or [[H176]] kettle [[H1731]] or [[H176]] cauldron [[H7037]] or [[H176]] cooking pot. [[H6517]] And the priest [[H3548]] would claim [[H3947]] for himself  whatever [[H3605]] the meat fork [[H4207]] brought up. [[H5927]] This is how [[H3602]] they treated [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] who came [[H935]] to Shiloh. [[H7887]] 
15 Even [[H1571]] before [[H2962]] the fat [[H2459]] was burned, [[H6999]] the servant [[H5288]] of the priest [[H3548]] would come [[H935]] and say [[H559]] to the man [[H376]] who was sacrificing, [[H2076]] “Give [[H5414]] the priest [[H3548]] some meat [[H1320]] to roast, [[H6740]] because he will not [[H3808]] accept [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] you [[H3588]] boiled [[H1310]] meat, [[H1320]] but only [[H518]] raw. [[H2416]] 
16 And [if] any man [[H376]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “The fat [[H2459]] must be burned [[H6999]] first; [[H6999]] then you can take [[H3947]] whatever [[H834]] you [[H5315]] want,” [[H8378]] the servant would reply, [[H559]] “No, [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] you must give [it to me] [[H5414]] right now. [[H6258]] If you refuse, [[H518]] I will take [[H3947]] it by force!” [[H2394]] 
17 Thus the sin [[H2403]] of these young men [[H5288]] was [[H1961]] severe [[H1419]] in the sight [[H6440]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] they [[H582]] {were treating} the LORD’s [[H3068]] offering [[H4503]] with contempt. [[H5006]] 
18 Now Samuel [[H8050]] was ministering [[H8334]] before [[H6440]] the LORD— [[H3068]] a boy [[H5288]] wearing [[H2296]] a linen [[H906]] ephod. [[H646]] 
19 Each year [[H3117]] his mother [[H517]] would make [[H6213]] him  a little [[H6996]] robe [[H4598]] and bring [it] [[H5927]] to him  when she went [[H5927]] with [[H854]] her husband [[H376]] to offer [[H2076]] the annual [[H3117]] sacrifice. [[H2077]] 
20 And Eli [[H5941]] would bless [[H1288]] Elkanah [[H511]] and his wife, [[H802]] saying, [[H559]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] give [[H7760]] you  children [[H2233]] by [[H4480]] this [[H2063]] woman [[H802]] in place of [[H8478]] the one [[H7596]] she dedicated to [[H7592]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] Then they would go [[H1980]] home. [[H4725]] 
21 So [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] attended to [[H6485]] Hannah, [[H2584]] and she conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] and two [[H8147]] daughters. [[H1323]] Meanwhile, the boy [[H5288]] Samuel [[H8050]] grew up [[H1431]] in the presence of [[H5973]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
22 Now Eli [[H5941]] was very [[H3966]] old, [[H2204]] and he heard [[H8085]] about everything [[H3605]] his sons [[H1121]] were doing [[H6213]] to all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and how [[H834]] they were sleeping with [[H7901]] the women [[H802]] who served [[H6633]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
23 “Why [[H4100]] are you doing [[H6213]] these [[H428]] things?” [[H1697]] [Eli] said to [his sons]. [[H559]] “I [[H595]] hear [[H8085]] about [[H853]] your wicked [[H7451]] deeds [[H1697]] from [[H853]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] people. [[H5971]] 
24 No, [[H408]] my sons; [[H1121]] [it is] not [[H3808]] a good [[H2896]] report [[H8052]] I [[H595]] hear [[H8085]] circulating among [[H5674]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] people. [[H5971]] 
25 If [[H518]] a man [[H376]] sins [[H2398]] against another man, [[H376]] God [[H430]] can intercede for him, [[H6419]] but if [[H518]] a man [[H376]] sins [[H2398]] against the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H4310]] can intercede [[H6419]] for him?”  But they would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to their father, [[H1]] since [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] intended [[H2654]] to put them to death. [[H4191]] 
26 And the boy [[H5288]] Samuel [[H8050]] continued to grow [[H1980]] in stature [[H1432]] and in favor [[H2896]] with [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] and with [[H5973]] men. [[H376]] 
27 Then a man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Eli [[H5941]] and told [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Did I not clearly reveal Myself [[H1540]] to [[H413]] your father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] when they were [[H1961]] in Egypt [[H4714]] under Pharaoh's [[H6547]] house? [[H1004]] 
28 And out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] I selected [[H977]] [your father] [[H853]] to be My priest, [[H3548]] to offer sacrifices [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] My altar, [[H4196]] to burn [[H6999]] incense, [[H7004]] and to wear [[H5375]] an ephod [[H646]] in My presence. [[H6440]] I also gave [[H5414]] to the house [[H1004]] of your father [[H1]] all [[H3605]] the offerings [[H801]] of the Israelites {made by fire}. [[H1121]] 
29 Why, then, [[H4100]] do you kick at [[H1163]] My sacrifice [[H2077]] and offering [[H4503]] that [[H834]] I have prescribed [[H6680]] for [My] dwelling place? [[H4583]] You have honored [[H3513]] your sons [[H1121]] more than Me [[H4480]] by fattening yourselves [[H1254]] with the best [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] the offerings [[H4503]] of My people [[H5971]] Israel.’ [[H3478]] 
30 Therefore, [[H3651]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] declares: [[H5002]] ‘I did indeed [[H559]] say [[H559]] that your house [[H1004]] and the house [[H1004]] of your father [[H1]] would walk [[H1980]] before Me [[H6440]] forever. [[H5769]] But now [[H6258]] the LORD [[H3068]] declares: [[H5002]] Far be it [[H2486]] from Me!  For [[H3588]] I will honor [[H3513]] those who honor Me, [[H3513]] but those who despise Me [[H959]] will be disdained. [[H7043]] 
31 Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming [[H935]] when I will cut off [[H1438]] your strength [[H2220]] and the strength [[H2220]] of your father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] so that no older man [[H2205]] will be left [[H1961]] in your house. [[H1004]] 
32 You will see [[H5027]] distress [[H6862]] [in My] dwelling place. [[H4583]] Despite all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] is good [[H3190]] in Israel, [[H3478]] no one [[H3808]] in your house [[H1004]] will ever again [[H3117]] reach [[H1961]] old age. [[H2205]] 
33 And every one [[H376]] of you  that I do not [[H3808]] cut off [[H3772]] from [[H5973]] My altar, [[H4196]] your eyes [[H5869]] will fail [[H3615]] and your heart [[H5315]] will grieve. [[H109]] All [[H3605]] your descendants [[H4768]] will die [[H4191]] in the prime of life. [[H376]] 
34 And this [[H2088]] sign [[H226]] shall come [[H935]] to you  concerning [[H413]] your two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas: [[H6372]] They will both [[H8147]] die [[H4191]] on the same [[H259]] day. [[H3117]] 
35 Then I will raise up [[H6965]] for Myself  a faithful [[H539]] priest. [[H3548]] He will do [[H6213]] whatever [[H834]] is in My heart [[H3824]] and mind. [[H5315]] And I will build [[H1129]] for him  an enduring [[H539]] house, [[H1004]] and he will walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] My anointed one [[H4899]] for all time. [[H3605]] 
36 And [[H1961]] everyone [[H3605]] left [[H3498]] in your house [[H1004]] will come [[H935]] and bow down [[H7812]] to him  for a piece [[H95]] of silver [[H3701]] or a morsel [[H3603]] of bread, [[H3899]] pleading, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] appoint me [[H5596]] to [[H413]] some [[H259]] priestly office, [[H3550]] so that I may eat [[H398]] a piece [[H6595]] of bread.”’” [[H3899]]
