1 Then Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] “The LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] me [[H853]] to anoint you [[H4886]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] His people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] Now therefore, [[H6258]] listen [[H8085]] to the words [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘I witnessed [[H6485]] what [[H834]] the Amalekites [[H6002]] did [[H6213]] to the Israelites [[H3478]] when [[H834]] they hindered them [[H7760]] on their way [[H1870]] up [[H5927]] from Egypt. [[H4714]] 
3 Now [[H6258]] go [[H1980]] and attack [[H5221]] the Amalekites [[H6002]] and completely destroy [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] belongs to them.  Do not [[H3808]] spare [[H2550]] them, [[H5921]] but put to death [[H4191]] men [[H376]] and [[H5704]] women, [[H802]] children [[H5768]] and [[H5704]] infants, [[H3243]] oxen [[H7794]] and [[H5704]] sheep, [[H7716]] camels [[H1581]] and [[H5704]] donkeys. [[H2543]] 
4 So Saul [[H7586]] summoned [[H8085]] the troops [[H5971]] and numbered them [[H6485]] at Telaim— [[H2923]] 200,000 [[H3967]] foot soldiers [[H7273]] and 10,000 [[H6235]] men [[H376]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
5 Saul [[H7586]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the city [[H5892]] of Amalek [[H6002]] and lay in wait [[H7378]] in the valley. [[H5158]] 
6 And he [[H7586]] warned [[H559]] the Kenites, [[H7017]] “Since you [[H859]] showed [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] when they came up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] go on [[H1980]] and get away [[H3381]] from [[H8432]] the Amalekites. [[H6003]] Otherwise [[H6435]] I will sweep you away [[H622]] with them.” [[H5973]] So the Kenites [[H7017]] moved away [[H5493]] from [[H8432]] the Amalekites. [[H6002]] 
7 Then Saul [[H7586]] struck down [[H5221]] the Amalekites [[H6002]] all the way [[H935]] from Havilah [[H2341]] to Shur, [[H7793]] which is [[H834]] east [[H6440]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
8 He captured [[H8610]] Agag [[H90]] king [[H4428]] of Amalek [[H6002]] alive, [[H2416]] but completely destroyed [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] the others [[H5971]] with the sword. [[H2719]] 
9 Saul [[H7586]] and his troops [[H5971]] spared [[H2550]] Agag, [[H90]] along with [[H5921]] the best [[H4315]] of the sheep [[H6629]] and cattle, [[H1241]] the fat calves [[H4932]] and [[H5921]] lambs, [[H3733]] and [[H5921]] the best [[H2896]] of everything else. [[H3605]] They were unwilling [[H14]] to destroy them, [[H2763]] but they utterly destroyed [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] that was despised [[H959]] and worthless. [[H4549]] 
10 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] saying, [[H559]] 
11 “I regret [[H5162]] that [[H3588]] I have made Saul [[H7586]] king, [[H4427]] for [[H3588]] he has turned away [[H7725]] from following Me [[H310]] and [[H853]] has not [[H3808]] carried out [[H6965]] My instructions.” [[H1697]] And Samuel [[H8050]] was distressed [[H2734]] and cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] that night. [[H3915]] 
12 Early in the morning [[H1242]] Samuel [[H8050]] got up [[H7925]] to confront [[H7122]] Saul, [[H7586]] but [he] was told, [[H5046]] “Saul [[H7586]] has gone [[H935]] to Carmel, [[H3760]] and behold, [[H2009]] he has set up [[H5324]] a monument [[H3027]] for himself  and has turned [[H5437]] and gone down [[H3381]] to Gilgal.” [[H1537]] 
13 When Samuel [[H8050]] reached [[H935]] him, [[H7586]] Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to him,  “May the LORD [[H3068]] bless [[H1288]] you. [[H859]] I have carried out [[H6965]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] instructions.” [[H1697]] 
14 But Samuel [[H8050]] replied, [[H559]] “Then what [[H4100]] [is] this [[H2088]] bleating [[H6963]] of sheep [[H6629]] and lowing [[H6963]] of cattle [[H1241]] I [[H595]] hear?” [[H8085]] 
15 Saul [[H7586]] answered, [[H559]] “The troops [[H5971]] brought them [[H935]] from the Amalekites; [[H6003]] they spared [[H2550]] the best [[H4315]] sheep [[H6629]] and cattle [[H1241]] to [[H4616]] sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] but [[H853]] the rest [[H3498]] we utterly destroyed.” [[H2763]] 
16 “Stop!” [[H7503]] exclaimed [[H559]] Samuel. [[H8050]] “Let me tell [[H5046]] you what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to me [[H413]] last night.” [[H3915]] “Tell me,” [[H1696]] Saul replied. [[H559]] 
17 And Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] “Although [[H518]] you [were once] [[H859]] small [[H6996]] in your own eyes, [[H5869]] have you [[H859]] not [[H3808]] become the head [[H7218]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel? [[H3478]] The LORD [[H3068]] anointed [[H4886]] you king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] 
18 and sent [[H7971]] you on a mission, [[H1870]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Go [[H1980]] and completely destroy [[H2763]] the sinful [[H2400]] Amalekites. [[H6002]] Fight [[H3898]] against them  until [[H5704]] you have wiped them out.’ [[H3615]] 
19 So why [[H4100]] did you not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the LORD? [[H3068]] Why did you rush [[H5860]] upon [[H413]] the plunder [[H7998]] and do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD?” [[H3068]] 
20 “But I did obey [[H8085]] the LORD,” [[H3068]] Saul [[H7586]] replied. [[H559]] “I went [[H1980]] on the mission [[H1870]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave me. [[H7971]] I brought back [[H935]] Agag [[H90]] king [[H4428]] of Amalek [[H6002]] and utterly destroyed [[H2763]] the Amalekites. [[H6002]] 
21 The troops [[H5971]] took [[H3947]] sheep [[H6629]] and cattle [[H1241]] from the plunder, [[H7998]] the best of which [[H7225]] was devoted to destruction [[H2764]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] at Gilgal.” [[H1537]] 
22 But Samuel [[H8050]] declared: [[H559]] “Does the LORD [[H3068]] delight [[H2656]] in burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sacrifices [[H2077]] as much as in obeying [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD? [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] obedience [[H8085]] is better [[H2896]] than sacrifice, [[H2077]] [and] attentiveness [[H7181]] is better than the fat [[H2459]] of rams. [[H352]] 
23 For [[H3588]] rebellion [[H4805]] is like the sin [[H2403]] of divination, [[H7081]] and arrogance [[H6484]] is like the wickedness [[H205]] of idolatry. [[H8655]] Because [[H3282]] you have rejected [[H3988]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] He has rejected you [[H3988]] as king.” [[H4428]] 
24 Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to Samuel, [[H8050]] “I have sinned; [[H2398]] I have transgressed [[H5674]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] commandment [[H6310]] and your instructions, [[H1697]] because [[H3588]] I feared [[H3372]] the people [[H5971]] and obeyed [[H8085]] their voice. [[H6963]] 
25 Now therefore, [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] forgive [[H5375]] my sin [[H2403]] and return [[H7725]] with me [[H5973]] so I can worship [[H7812]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
26 “I will not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] with you,” [[H5973]] Samuel [[H8050]] replied. [[H559]] “For [[H3588]] you have rejected [[H3988]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and [He] [[H3068]] has rejected you [[H3988]] as [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel.” [[H3478]] 
27 As Samuel [[H8050]] turned [[H5437]] to go, [[H1980]] Saul grabbed [[H2388]] the hem [[H3671]] of his robe, [[H4598]] and it tore. [[H7167]] 
28 So Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has torn [[H7167]] the kingdom [[H4468]] of Israel [[H3478]] from [[H4480]] you today [[H3117]] and has given [[H5414]] it to your neighbor [[H7453]] who is better than you. [[H2896]] 
29 Moreover, [[H1571]] the Glory [[H5331]] of Israel [[H3478]] does not [[H3808]] lie [[H8266]] or change His mind, [[H5162]] for [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] is not [[H3808]] a man, [[H120]] that He should change His mind.” [[H5162]] 
30 “I have sinned,” [[H2398]] Saul replied. [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] honor [[H3513]] me now [[H6258]] before [[H5048]] the elders [[H2205]] of my people [[H5971]] and before [[H5048]] Israel. [[H3478]] Come back [[H7725]] with me, [[H5973]] so that I may worship [[H7812]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]] 
31 So Samuel [[H8050]] went back [[H7725]] with [[H310]] Saul, [[H7586]] and Saul [[H7586]] worshiped [[H7812]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
32 Then Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] “Bring [[H5066]] me [[H413]] Agag [[H90]] king [[H4428]] of the Amalekites.” [[H6002]] Agag [[H90]] came [[H1980]] to him [[H413]] cheerfully, [[H4574]] for he [[H90]] thought, [[H559]] “Surely [[H403]] the bitterness [[H4751]] of death [[H4194]] is past.” [[H5493]] 
33 But Samuel [[H8050]] declared: [[H559]] “As [[H834]] your sword [[H2719]] has made women [[H802]] childless, [[H7921]] so [[H3651]] your mother [[H517]] will be childless [[H7921]] among women.” [[H802]] And Samuel [[H8050]] hacked Agag [[H90]] to pieces [[H8158]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] at Gilgal. [[H1537]] 
34 Then Samuel [[H8050]] went [[H1980]] to Ramah, [[H7414]] but Saul [[H7586]] went up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] his home [[H1004]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] of Saul. [[H7586]] 
35 And to [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of his death, [[H4194]] Samuel [[H8050]] never [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] visited [[H7200]] Saul. [[H7586]] Samuel [[H8050]] mourned [[H56]] for [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] and the LORD [[H3068]] regretted [[H5162]] He had made Saul [[H7586]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]
