1 Now the Philistines [[H6430]] brought all [[H3605]] their forces [[H4264]] together [[H6908]] at Aphek, [[H663]] while Israel [[H3478]] camped [[H2583]] by the spring [[H5869]] in Jezreel. [[H3157]] 
2 As the Philistine [[H6430]] leaders [[H5633]] marched out [[H5674]] their units of hundreds [[H3967]] and thousands, [[H505]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] marched [[H5674]] behind them [[H314]] with [[H5973]] Achish. [[H397]] 
3 The commanders [[H8269]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] asked, [[H559]] “What [about] [[H4100]] these [[H428]] Hebrews?” [[H5680]] Achish [[H397]] replied, [[H559]] “Is this [[H2088]] not [[H3808]] David, [[H1732]] the servant [[H5650]] of King [[H4428]] Saul [[H7586]] of Israel? [[H3478]] He [[H834]] has been [[H1961]] with me [[H854]] all these [[H2088]] days, [[H3117]] even [[H176]] years, [[H8141]] and from [[H3808]] the day [[H3117]] he defected [[H5307]] until today [[H5704]] I have found [[H4672]] no fault [[H3972]] in him.”  
4 But the commanders [[H8269]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] were angry [[H7107]] with Achish [[H5921]] and told him, [[H559]] “Send that man [[H376]] back [[H7725]] and let him return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] you assigned him. [[H6485]] He must not [[H3808]] go down [[H3381]] with [[H5973]] us into battle [[H4421]] only [[H3808]] to become [[H1961]] our adversary [[H7854]] during the war. [[H4421]] What better way [[H4100]] for him to regain the favor [[H7521]] of his master [[H113]] than [[H3808]] with the heads [[H7218]] of our men? [[H582]] 
5 Is this [[H2088]] not [[H3808]] the David [[H1732]] about whom [[H834]] they sing [[H6030]] in their dances: [[H4246]] ‘Saul [[H7586]] has slain [[H5221]] [his] thousands, [[H505]] and David [[H1732]] his tens of thousands’?” [[H7233]] 
6 So Achish [[H397]] summoned [[H7121]] David [[H1732]] and told him, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] you [[H859]] have been upright [[H3477]] in my sight, [[H5869]] and it seems right [[H2896]] that you should march in and out [[H3318]] with me [[H854]] in the army, [[H4264]] because [[H3588]] I have found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] fault [[H7451]] in you  from the day [[H3117]] you came [[H935]] to me [[H413]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] But you [[H859]] have no [[H3808]] favor [[H2896]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the leaders. [[H5633]] 
7 Therefore now [[H6258]] turn back [[H7725]] and go [[H1980]] in peace, [[H7965]] and you will not [[H3808]] be doing anything [[H6213]] to displease [[H5869]] the leaders [[H5633]] of the Philistines.” [[H6430]] 
8 “But [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] have I done?” [[H6213]] David [[H1732]] replied. [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] have you found [[H4672]] against your servant, [[H5650]] from the day [[H3117]] I came [[H1961]] to you [[H6440]] until today, [[H5704]] to [[H3588]] keep me from [[H3808]] going along [[H935]] to fight [[H3898]] against the enemies [[H341]] of my lord [[H113]] the king?” [[H4428]] 
9 Achish [[H397]] replied, [[H6030]] “I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [are] [[H859]] as pleasing [[H2896]] in my sight [[H5869]] as an angel [[H4397]] of God. [[H430]] But [[H389]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] have said, [[H559]] ‘He must not [[H3808]] go [[H5927]] into battle [[H4421]] with us.’ [[H5973]] 
10 Now then, [[H6258]] get up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] along with your masters’ [[H113]] servants [[H5650]] who [[H834]] came [[H935]] with you, [[H854]] and go [[H1980]] as soon as [[H7925]] it is light.” [[H215]] 
11 So David [[H1732]] and his men [[H582]] got up early [[H7925]] in the morning [[H1242]] to return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] And the Philistines [[H6430]] went up [[H5927]] to Jezreel. [[H3157]]
