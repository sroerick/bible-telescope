1 Now the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered [[H622]] their forces [[H4264]] for war [[H4421]] at Socoh [[H7755]] in Judah [[H3063]] and camped [[H2583]] between [[H996]] Socoh [[H7755]] and Azekah [[H5825]] in Ephes-dammim. [[H658]] 
2 Saul [[H7586]] and the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] assembled [[H622]] and camped [[H2583]] in the Valley of Elah, [[H425]] arraying themselves [[H6186]] for battle [[H4421]] against [[H7122]] the Philistines. [[H6430]] 
3 The Philistines [[H6430]] stood [[H5975]] on [[H413]] one [[H2088]] hill [[H2022]] and the Israelites [[H3478]] stood [[H5975]] on [[H413]] another, [[H2088]] with the valley [[H1516]] between them. [[H996]] 
4 Then a champion [[H376]] named [[H8034]] Goliath, [[H1555]] who was from Gath, [[H1661]] came out [[H3318]] from the Philistine [[H6430]] camp. [[H4264]] He was six [[H8337]] cubits [[H520]] and a span [[H2239]] in height, [[H1363]] 
5 and he wore a bronze [[H5178]] helmet [[H3553]] and bronze [[H5178]] coat [[H8302]] of mail [[H7193]] weighing [[H4948]] five [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] shekels. [[H8255]] 
6 [He had] armor [[H4697]] of bronze [[H5178]] on [[H5921]] his legs, [[H7272]] and a bronze [[H5178]] javelin [[H3591]] was slung between [[H996]] his shoulders. [[H3802]] 
7 The shaft [[H2671]] of his spear [[H2595]] was like a weaver's [[H707]] rod, [[H4500]] and its iron [[H1270]] point [[H3852]] [weighed] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] shekels. [[H8255]] In addition, his shield bearer [[H5375]] went [[H1980]] before him. [[H6440]] 
8 And [Goliath] stood [[H5975]] and shouted [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the ranks [[H4634]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “Why [[H4100]] do you come out [[H3318]] and array yourselves [[H6186]] for battle? [[H4421]] Am I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] a Philistine, [[H6430]] and are you [[H859]] not servants [[H5650]] of Saul? [[H7586]] Choose [[H1262]] one of your men [[H376]] and have him come down [[H3381]] against me. [[H413]] 
9 If [[H518]] he is able [[H3201]] to fight [[H3898]] me [[H854]] and kill me, [[H5221]] then we will be [[H1961]] your  servants. [[H5650]] But if [[H518]] I [[H589]] prevail [[H3201]] against him  and kill him, [[H5221]] then you shall be [[H1961]] our  servants [[H5650]] and labor [[H5647]] for us.” [[H853]] 
10 Then the Philistine [[H6430]] said, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] defy [[H2778]] the ranks [[H4634]] of Israel [[H3478]] this [[H2088]] day! [[H3117]] Give [[H5414]] me  a man [[H376]] to fight!” [[H3898]] 
11 On hearing [[H8085]] the [[H428]] words [[H1697]] of the Philistine, [[H6430]] Saul [[H7586]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] were dismayed [[H2865]] and greatly [[H3966]] afraid. [[H3372]] 
12 Now David [[H1732]] was the son [[H1121]] of a man [[H376]] named [[H8034]] Jesse, [[H3448]] an Ephrathite [[H673]] from  Bethlehem [[H1035]] of Judah [[H3063]] who had  eight [[H8083]] sons [[H1121]] in the days [[H3117]] of Saul. [[H7586]] And Jesse was old [[H2204]] and advanced [in years]. [[H935]] 
13 The three [[H7969]] older [[H1419]] sons [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] had followed [[H1980]] Saul [[H7586]] to the war: [[H4421]] The firstborn [[H1060]] [was] Eliab, [[H446]] the second [[H4932]] [was] Abinadab, [[H41]] and the third [[H7992]] [was] Shammah. [[H8048]] 
14 And David [[H1732]] was the youngest. [[H6996]] The three [[H7969]] oldest [[H1419]] had followed [[H1980]] Saul, [[H7586]] 
15 but David [[H1732]] went back and forth [[H1980]] from [[H5921]] Saul [[H7586]] to tend [[H7462]] his father’s [[H1]] sheep [[H6629]] in Bethlehem. [[H1035]] 
16 For forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] the Philistine [[H6430]] came forward [[H5066]] every morning [[H7925]] and evening [[H6150]] to take his stand. [[H3320]] 
17 One day Jesse [[H3448]] said [[H559]] to his son [[H1121]] David, [[H1732]] “Take [[H3947]] this [[H2088]] ephah [[H374]] of roasted grain [[H7039]] and these [[H2088]] ten [loaves] [[H6235]] of bread [[H3899]] for your brothers [[H251]] and hurry [[H7323]] to their [[H251]] camp. [[H4264]] 
18 Take also [[H935]] these [[H428]] ten [[H6235]] portions [[H2757]] of cheese [[H2461]] to the commander [[H8269]] of [their] unit. [[H505]] Check [[H6485]] on the welfare [[H7965]] of your brothers [[H251]] and bring back [[H3947]] an assurance from them. [[H6161]] 
19 They [[H1992]] are with Saul [[H7586]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of Israel [[H3478]] in the Valley of Elah, [[H425]] fighting [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] the Philistines.” [[H6430]] 
20 So David [[H1732]] got up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] left [[H5203]] the flock [[H6629]] with [[H5921]] a keeper, [[H8104]] loaded up, [[H5375]] and set out [[H1980]] as [[H834]] Jesse [[H3448]] had instructed him. [[H6680]] He reached [[H935]] the camp [[H4570]] as the army [[H2428]] was marching out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] its position [[H4634]] and shouting [[H7321]] the battle cry. [[H4421]] 
21 And Israel [[H3478]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] arrayed [[H6186]] in formation [[H4634]] against [[H7122]] each other. [[H4634]] 
22 Then David [[H1732]] left [[H5203]] his supplies [[H3627]] in [[H5921]] the care [[H3027]] of the quartermaster [[H8104]] and ran [[H7323]] to the battle line. [[H4634]] When he arrived, [[H935]] he asked [[H7592]] his brothers [[H251]] how they were doing. [[H7965]] 
23 And as he [[H1931]] was speaking [[H1696]] with them, [[H5973]] suddenly [[H2009]] the champion [[H376]] named [[H8034]] Goliath, [[H1555]] the Philistine [[H6430]] from Gath, [[H1661]] came forward [[H5927]] from the Philistines [[H6430]] and shouted [[H1696]] his usual words, [[H1697]] which [[H428]] David [[H1732]] also heard. [[H8085]] 
24 When all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] saw Goliath, [[H7200]] they fled [[H5127]] from him [[H6440]] in great fear. [[H3372]] 
25 Now the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] had been saying, [[H559]] “Do you see [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] who keeps coming out [[H5927]] to defy [[H2778]] Israel? [[H3478]] To the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] kills him [[H5221]] the king [[H4428]] will give [[H6238]] great [[H1419]] riches. [[H6239]] And [[H853]] he will give [[H5414]] him  his daughter in marriage [[H1323]] and [[H853]] exempt [[H6213]] his father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] from taxation [[H2670]] in Israel. [[H3478]] 
26 David [[H1732]] asked [[H559]] the men [[H376]] who were standing [[H5975]] with him, [[H5973]] “What [[H4100]] will be done [[H6213]] for the man who [[H834]] kills [[H5221]] this [[H1975]] Philistine [[H6430]] and removes [[H5493]] this disgrace [[H2781]] from [[H5921]] Israel? [[H3478]] Just who [[H4310]] is this [[H2088]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] Philistine, [[H6430]] that [[H3588]] he should defy [[H2778]] the armies [[H4634]] of the living [[H2416]] God? [[H430]] 
27 The people [[H5971]] told [[H559]] him  about the [[H2088]] offer, [[H1697]] saying, [[H559]] “That is what [[H3541]] will be done [[H6213]] for the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] kills him.” [[H5221]] 
28 Now when David’s oldest [[H1419]] brother [[H251]] Eliab [[H446]] heard [[H8085]] him speaking [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the men, [[H376]] his anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against David. [[H1732]] “Why [[H4100]] have you come down [[H3381]] here?” [[H2088]] he asked. [[H559]] “And with [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] did you leave [[H5203]] those [[H2007]] few [[H4592]] sheep [[H6629]] in the wilderness? [[H4057]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] your pride [[H2087]] and wickedness [[H7455]] of heart [[H3824]] you have come down [[H3381]] to [[H4616]] see [[H7200]] the battle!” [[H4421]] 
29 “What [[H4100]] have I done [[H6213]] now?” [[H6258]] said [[H559]] David. [[H1732]] “Was it not [[H1931]] just a question?” [[H1697]] 
30 Then he turned [[H5437]] from him [[H681]] toward [[H4136]] another [[H312]] and asked [[H559]] about the [[H2088]] offer, [[H1697]] and those people [[H5971]] answered [[H7725]] just as [[H1697]] the first ones. [[H7223]] 
31 Now David's [[H1732]] words [[H1696]] were overheard [[H8085]] and reported [[H5046]] to [[H6440]] Saul, [[H7586]] who called for him. [[H3947]] 
32 David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] “Let no [[H408]] man's [[H120]] heart [[H3820]] fail [[H5307]] on account of [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] Philistine. [[H6430]] Your servant [[H5650]] will go [[H1980]] and fight him!” [[H3898]] 
33 But Saul [[H7586]] replied, [[H559]] “You cannot [[H3808]] go out [[H1980]] against [[H413]] this [[H2088]] Philistine [[H6430]] to fight [[H3898]] him. [[H5973]] You are [[H859]] just a boy, [[H5288]] and he [[H1931]] has been a warrior [[H376]] from his youth.” [[H5271]] 
34 David [[H1732]] replied, [[H559]] “Your servant [[H5650]] has been tending [[H7462]] his father’s [[H1]] sheep, [[H6629]] and whenever a lion [[H738]] or a bear [[H1677]] came [[H935]] and carried off [[H5375]] a lamb [[H7716]] from the flock, [[H5739]] 
35 I went [[H3318]] after it, [[H310]] struck it down, [[H5221]] and delivered [the lamb] [[H5337]] from its mouth. [[H6310]] If it reared up [[H6965]] against me, [[H5921]] I would grab [[H2388]] it by its fur, [[H2206]] strike it down, [[H5221]] and kill it. [[H4191]] 
36 Your servant [[H5650]] has killed [[H5221]] lions [[H738]] and [[H1571]] bears; [[H1677]] this [[H2088]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] Philistine [[H6430]] will be [[H1961]] like one [[H259]] of them, [[H1992]] for [[H3588]] he has defied [[H2778]] the armies [[H4634]] of the living [[H2416]] God.” [[H430]] 
37 David [[H1732]] added, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] who [[H834]] delivered me [[H5337]] from the claws [[H3027]] of the lion [[H738]] [and] [[H3027]] the bear [[H1677]] will deliver me [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3027]] of this [[H2088]] Philistine.” [[H6430]] “Go,” [[H1980]] said [[H559]] Saul, [[H7586]] “and may the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with you.” [[H5973]] 
38 Then Saul [[H7586]] clothed [[H3847]] David [[H1732]] in his own tunic, [[H4055]] put [[H5414]] a bronze [[H5178]] helmet [[H6959]] on [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and dressed [[H3847]] him [[H853]] in armor. [[H8302]] 
39 David [[H1732]] strapped [[H2296]] his sword [[H2719]] over [[H5921]] the tunic [[H4055]] and tried [[H2974]] to walk, [[H1980]] but [[H3588]] he was not [[H3808]] used to [all this armor]. [[H5254]] “I cannot [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in these,” [[H428]] David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul. [[H7586]] “I am not [[H3808]] used to them.” [[H5254]] So David [[H1732]] took them off. [[H5493]] 
40 And [David] took [[H3947]] his staff [[H4731]] in his hand, [[H3027]] selected [[H977]] five [[H2568]] smooth [[H2512]] stones [[H68]] from [[H4480]] the brook, [[H5158]] and put [[H7760]] them in the pouch [[H3219]] of his shepherd’s [[H7462]] bag. [[H3627]] And with his sling [[H7050]] in hand, [[H3027]] he approached [[H5066]] the Philistine. [[H6430]] 
41 Now the Philistine [[H6430]] came [[H1980]] closer [[H7131]] and closer to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] with his shield-bearer [[H376]] before him. [[H6440]] 
42 When the Philistine [[H6430]] looked [[H5027]] and saw [[H7200]] David, [[H1732]] he despised [[H959]] him because [[H3588]] he was [[H1961]] just a boy, [[H5288]] ruddy [[H132]] and [[H5973]] handsome. [[H3303]] 
43 “Am I [[H595]] a dog,” [[H3611]] he [[H6430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] come [[H935]] at me [[H413]] with sticks?” [[H4731]] And the Philistine [[H6430]] cursed [[H7043]] David [[H1732]] by his gods. [[H430]] 
44 “Come [[H1980]] here,” [[H6430]] he called [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “and I will give [[H5414]] your flesh [[H1320]] to the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] and the beasts [[H929]] of the field!” [[H7704]] 
45 But David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] “You [[H859]] come [[H935]] against [[H413]] me with a dagger, [[H3591]] spear, [[H2595]] and sword, [[H2719]] but I [[H595]] come [[H935]] against [[H413]] you in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of the armies [[H4634]] of Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] you have defied. [[H2778]] 
46 This [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] will deliver you [[H5462]] into my hand. [[H3027]] This [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] I will strike you down, [[H5221]] cut off your head, [[H7218]] and give [[H5414]] the carcasses [[H6297]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] to the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] and the creatures [[H2416]] of the earth. [[H776]] Then the whole [[H3605]] world [[H776]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] a God [[H430]] in Israel. [[H3478]] 
47 And all [[H3605]] those [[H2088]] assembled here [[H6951]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it is not [[H3808]] by sword [[H2719]] or by spear [[H2595]] that the LORD [[H3068]] saves; [[H3467]] for [[H3588]] the battle [is] [[H4421]] the LORD's, [[H3068]] and He will give [[H5414]] all of you [[H853]] into our hands.” [[H3027]] 
48 As [[H3588]] the Philistine [[H6430]] started [[H1980]] forward [[H7126]] to attack [[H7122]] him, [[H1732]] David [[H1732]] ran [[H7323]] quickly [[H4116]] toward the battle line [[H4634]] to meet [[H7122]] him. [[H6430]] 
49 Then David [[H1732]] reached [[H7971]] into [[H413]] his bag, [[H3627]] took [[H3947]] out [[H8033]] a stone [[H68]] and slung it, [[H7049]] striking [[H5221]] the Philistine [[H6430]] on [[H413]] the forehead. [[H4696]] The stone [[H68]] sank [[H2883]] into his forehead, [[H4696]] and he fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H6440]] on the ground. [[H776]] 
50 Thus David [[H1732]] prevailed [[H2388]] over [[H4480]] the Philistine [[H6430]] with a sling [[H7050]] and a stone; [[H68]] without [[H369]] a sword [[H2719]] in his hand [[H3027]] he struck down [[H5221]] the Philistine [[H6430]] and killed him. [[H4191]] 
51 David [[H1732]] ran [[H7323]] and stood [[H5975]] over him. [[H413]] He grabbed [[H3947]] the Philistine’s [[H6430]] sword [[H2719]] and pulled it [[H8025]] from its sheath. [[H8593]] And having killed him, [[H4191]] he cut off [[H3772]] his head [[H7218]] with [the sword].  When the Philistines [[H6430]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] their hero [[H1368]] was dead, [[H4191]] they turned and ran. [[H5127]] 
52 Then the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah [[H3063]] charged forward [[H6965]] with a shout [[H7321]] and pursued [[H7291]] the Philistines [[H6430]] to [[H5704]] the entrance [[H935]] of Gath [[H1516]] and to [[H5704]] the gates [[H8179]] of Ekron. [[H6138]] The bodies [[H2491]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] were strewn [[H5307]] along the Shaaraim [[H8189]] road [[H1870]] to [[H5704]] Gath [[H1661]] and Ekron. [[H6138]] 
53 When the Israelites [[H1121]] returned [[H7725]] from their pursuit [[H1814]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] they plundered [[H8155]] their camps. [[H4264]] 
54 David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] the head [[H7218]] of the Philistine [[H6430]] and brought [[H935]] it to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] but [[H853]] he put [[H7760]] Goliath’s weapons [[H3627]] in his own tent. [[H168]] 
55 As Saul [[H7586]] had watched [[H7200]] David [[H1732]] going out [[H3318]] to confront [[H7122]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abner [[H74]] the commander [[H8269]] of the army, [[H6635]] “Abner, [[H74]] whose [[H4310]] son [[H1121]] is this [[H2088]] young man?” [[H5288]] “As surely as you [[H5315]] live, [[H2416]] O king,” [[H4428]] Abner [[H74]] replied, [[H559]] “I do not [[H518]] know.” [[H3045]] 
56 “Find out [[H7592]] whose [[H4310]] son [[H1121]] this [[H2088]] young man is!” [[H5958]] said [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]] 
57 So when David [[H1732]] returned [[H7725]] from killing [[H5221]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] still holding [his] [[H6430]] head [[H7218]] in his hand, [[H3027]] Abner [[H74]] took [[H3947]] him [[H853]] and brought him [[H935]] before [[H6440]] Saul. [[H7586]] 
58 “Whose [[H4310]] son [[H1121]] are you, [[H859]] young man?” [[H5288]] asked [[H559]] Saul. [[H7586]] “[I am] the son [[H1121]] of your servant [[H5650]] Jesse [[H3448]] of Bethlehem,” [[H1022]] David [[H1732]] replied. [[H559]]
