[[1 Samuel 29|←]] • [[1 Samuel 31|→]]
1 On the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] arrived [[H935]] in Ziklag, [[H6860]] and the Amalekites [[H6003]] had raided [[H6584]] the Negev, [[H5045]] attacked [[H5221]] Ziklag, [[H6860]] and burned it down. [[H8313]] 
2 They had taken captive [[H7617]] the women [[H802]] and all who were [[H834]] there,  both young [[H6996]] and [[H5704]] old. [[H1419]] They had not killed [[H4191]] anyone, [[H376]] but had carried them off [[H5090]] as they went [[H1980]] on their way. [[H1870]] 
3 When David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] came [[H935]] to the city, [[H5892]] they found [[H2009]] it burned down [[H8313]] and their wives [[H802]] and sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] taken captive. [[H7617]] 
4 So David [[H1732]] and the troops [[H5971]] with him [[H854]] lifted up [[H5375]] their voices [[H6963]] and wept [[H1058]] until [[H5704]] they had no [[H369]] strength [[H3581]] left to weep. [[H1058]] 
5 David’s [[H1732]] two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] Ahinoam [[H293]] of Jezreel [[H3159]] and Abigail [[H26]] the widow [[H802]] of Nabal [[H5037]] of Carmel, [[H3761]] had been taken captive. [[H7617]] 
6 And David [[H1732]] was greatly [[H3966]] distressed [[H3334]] because [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] spoke [[H559]] of stoning him, [[H5619]] because [[H3588]] the soul [[H5315]] of every man [[H376]] grieved [[H4784]] for [[H5921]] his sons [[H1121]] and [[H5921]] daughters. [[H1323]] But David [[H1732]] found strength [[H2388]] in the LORD [[H3068]] his God. [[H430]] 
7 Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abiathar [[H54]] the priest, [[H3548]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahimelech, [[H288]] “Bring [[H5066]] me  the ephod.” [[H646]] So Abiathar [[H54]] brought [[H5066]] it [[H646]] to [[H413]] him, [[H1732]] 
8 and David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] “Should I pursue [[H7291]] these [[H2088]] raiders? [[H1416]] Will I overtake them?” [[H5381]] “Pursue [[H7291]] them,” [[H3588]] the LORD replied, [[H559]] “for you will surely [[H5381]] overtake them [[H5381]] and rescue the captives.” [[H5337]] 
9 So David [[H1732]] and his six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] went [[H1980]] to [[H5704]] the Brook [[H5158]] of Besor, [[H1308]] where some stayed behind [[H3498]] 
10 because [[H834]] two hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] were too exhausted [[H6296]] to cross [[H5674]] the brook. [[H5158]] But David [[H1732]] and four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] continued in pursuit. [[H7291]] 
11 Now [his men] found [[H4672]] an Egyptian [[H4713]] in the field [[H7704]] and brought [[H3947]] him to [[H413]] David. [[H1732]] They gave [[H5414]] [the man]  water [[H4325]] to drink [[H8248]] and food [[H3899]] to eat— [[H398]] 
12 a piece [[H6400]] of a fig cake [[H1690]] and two [[H8147]] clusters of raisins. [[H6778]] So he ate [[H398]] and was revived, [[H7725]] for [[H3588]] he had not [[H3808]] had any [[H398]] food [[H3899]] [or] [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] for three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] and three [[H7969]] nights. [[H3915]] 
13 Then David [[H1732]] asked him, [[H559]] “To whom [[H4310]] do you [belong], [[H859]] and where [[H335]] are you from?” [[H859]] “I am [[H595]] an Egyptian,” [[H4713]] he replied, [[H559]] “the slave [[H5650]] of an Amalekite. [[H6003]] My master [[H113]] abandoned me [[H5800]] three [[H7969]] days ago [[H3117]] when [[H3588]] I fell ill. [[H2470]] 
14 We [[H587]] raided [[H6584]] the Negev [[H5045]] of the Cherethites, [[H3774]] the territory of Judah, [[H3063]] and the Negev [[H5045]] of Caleb, [[H3612]] and we burned down [[H8313]] Ziklag.” [[H6860]] 
15 “Will you lead [[H3381]] me to [[H413]] these [[H2088]] raiders?” [[H1416]] David [[H1732]] asked. [[H559]] And [the man] replied, [[H559]] “Swear [[H7650]] to me  by God [[H430]] that you will not [[H518]] kill me [[H4191]] [or] [[H518]] deliver me [[H5462]] into the hands [[H3027]] of my master, [[H113]] and I will lead [[H3381]] you to them.” [[H413]] 
16 So he led [David] down, [[H3381]] and there were the Amalekites [[H2009]] spread out [[H5203]] over [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the land, [[H776]] eating, [[H398]] drinking, [[H8354]] and celebrating [[H2287]] the great [[H1419]] amount of plunder [[H7998]] they had taken [[H3947]] from the land [[H776]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] and the land [[H776]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
17 And David [[H1732]] struck them down [[H5221]] from twilight [[H5399]] until [[H5704]] the evening [[H6153]] of the next day. [[H4283]] Not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] escaped, [[H4422]] except [[H3588]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] young [[H5288]] men [[H376]] who [[H834]] fled, [[H5127]] riding off [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] camels. [[H1581]] 
18 So David [[H1732]] recovered [[H5337]] everything [[H3605]] the Amalekites [[H6002]] had taken, [[H3947]] [including] [[H1732]] his two [[H8147]] wives. [[H802]] 
19 Nothing [[H3808]] was missing, [[H5737]] young [[H6996]] or [[H5704]] old, [[H1419]] son [[H1121]] or daughter, [[H1323]] or any [[H3605]] of the plunder [[H7998]] the Amalekites had taken. [[H3947]] David [[H1732]] brought everything [[H3605]] back. [[H7725]] 
20 And he [[H1732]] recovered [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the flocks [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] which his men drove [[H5090]] ahead of [[H6440]] the other livestock, [[H4735]] calling out, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] is David’s [[H1732]] plunder!” [[H7998]] 
21 When David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the two hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] who [[H834]] had been too exhausted [[H6296]] to follow [[H1980]] him [[H1732]] from the Brook [[H5158]] of Besor, [[H1308]] they came out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7122]] him [[H1732]] [and] [[H7122]] the troops [[H5971]] with him. [[H854]] As David [[H1732]] approached [[H5066]] the men, [[H5971]] he greeted [[H7592]] them, [[H7965]] 
22 but all [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7451]] and worthless [[H1100]] men [[H376]] among those who [[H834]] had gone [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] said, [[H6030]] “Because [[H3282]] they did not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] with us, [[H5973]] we will not [[H3808]] share with them [[H5414]] the plunder [[H7998]] we recovered, [[H5337]] except [[H3588]] for each [[H376]] man’s wife [[H802]] and children. [[H1121]] They may take [[H5090]] them and go. [[H1980]] 
23 But David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “My brothers, [[H251]] you must not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] this [[H3651]] with what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has given us. [[H5414]] He has protected [[H8104]] us [[H853]] and delivered [[H5414]] into our hands [[H3027]] the raiders [[H1416]] who came [[H935]] against us. [[H5921]] 
24 Who [[H4310]] will listen [[H8085]] to your proposal? [[H1697]] The share [[H2506]] of the one who went [[H3381]] to battle [[H4421]] {will match} the share [[H2506]] of the one who stayed [[H3427]] with [[H5921]] the supplies. [[H3627]] They will share [[H2505]] alike.” [[H3162]] 
25 And so it has been [[H1961]] from that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] forward. [[H4605]] David established this [[H7760]] statute [[H2706]] as an ordinance [[H4941]] for Israel [[H3478]] to [[H5704]] this very [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
26 When David [[H1732]] arrived [[H935]] in [[H413]] Ziklag, [[H6860]] he sent [[H7971]] some of the plunder [[H7998]] to his friends, [[H7453]] the elders [[H2205]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] “Here [[H2009]] is a gift [[H1293]] for you  from the plunder [[H7998]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] enemies.” [[H341]] 
27 He sent gifts to those [[H834]] in Bethel, [[H1008]] Ramoth Negev, [[H7418]] and Jattir; [[H3492]] 
28 to those [[H834]] in Aroer, [[H6177]] Siphmoth, [[H8224]] and Eshtemoa; [[H851]] 
29 to those [[H834]] in Racal [[H7403]] and [[H834]] in the cities [[H5892]] of the Jerahmeelites [[H3397]] and [[H5892]] Kenites; [[H7017]] 
30 to those [[H834]] in Hormah, [[H2767]] Bor-ashan, [[H3565]] and Athach; [[H6269]] 
31 to those [[H834]] in Hebron, [[H2275]] and to those in all [[H3605]] the places [[H4725]] where [[H834]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] had roamed. [[H1980]]
