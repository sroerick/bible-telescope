# 1 Samuel 8
[[1 Samuel 7|←]] • [[1 Samuel 9|→]]
1 When [[H834]] Samuel [[H8050]] grew old, [[H2204]] he appointed [[H7760]] his sons [[H1121]] as judges [[H8199]] over Israel. [[H3478]] 
2 The name [[H8034]] of his firstborn [[H1060]] son [[H1121]] was [[H1961]] Joel, [[H3100]] and the name [[H8034]] of his second [[H4932]] was Abijah. [[H29]] They were judges [[H8199]] in Beersheba. [[H884]] 
3 But his sons [[H1121]] did not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in his ways; [[H1870]] they turned aside [[H5186]] toward [[H310]] dishonest gain, [[H1215]] accepted [[H3947]] bribes, [[H7810]] and perverted [[H5186]] justice. [[H4941]] 
4 So all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] gathered together [[H6908]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Samuel [[H8050]] at Ramah. [[H7414]] 
5 “Look,” [[H2009]] they said, [[H559]] “you [[H859]] are old, [[H2204]] and your sons [[H1121]] do not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in your ways. [[H1870]] Now [[H6258]] appoint [[H7760]] a king [[H4428]] to judge us [[H8199]] like all [[H3605]] the other nations.” [[H1471]] 
6 But when [[H834]] they said, [[H559]] “Give [[H5414]] us a king [[H4428]] to judge us,” [[H8199]] their demand [[H1697]] was displeasing [[H7489]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Samuel; [[H8050]] so he [[H8050]] prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] “Listen [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of the people [[H5971]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they say [[H559]] to you, [[H413]] for [[H3588]] it is not [[H3808]] you [[H853]] they have rejected, [[H3988]] but [[H3588]] they have rejected [[H3988]] Me [[H853]] as their king. [[H4427]] 
8 They [[H1992]] are doing [[H6213]] to you  just as [[H1571]] they have done [[H6213]] from the day [[H3117]] I brought them up [[H5927]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] forsaking Me [[H5800]] and serving [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]] 
9 Now [[H6258]] listen to them, [[H8085]] but [[H389]] you must solemnly warn [[H5749]] them  and show [[H5046]] them  the manner [[H4941]] of the king [[H4428]] who [[H834]] will reign [[H4427]] over them.” [[H5921]] 
10 So Samuel [[H8050]] spoke [[H559]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] who were asking him for [[H7592]] a king. [[H4428]] 
11 He said, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] will be [[H1961]] the manner [[H4941]] of the king [[H4428]] who [[H834]] will rule [[H4427]] over you: [[H5921]] He will take [[H3947]] your sons [[H1121]] and appoint [them] [[H7760]] to  his own chariots [[H4818]] and horses, [[H6571]] to run [[H7323]] in front of [[H6440]] his chariots. [[H4818]] 
12 He will appoint [[H7760]] some for himself  as commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and of fifties, [[H2572]] and others to plow [[H2790]] his ground, [[H2758]] to reap [[H7114]] his harvest, [[H7105]] and to make [[H6213]] his weapons [[H3627]] of war [[H4421]] and equip [[H3627]] his chariots. [[H7393]] 
13 And [[H853]] he will take [[H3947]] your daughters [[H1323]] [to [be] perfumers, [[H7548]] cooks, [[H2879]] and bakers. [[H644]] 
14 He will take [[H3947]] the best [[H2896]] of your fields [[H7704]] and [[H853]] vineyards [[H3754]] and olive groves [[H2132]] and give [[H5414]] them to his servants. [[H5650]] 
15 He will take a tenth [[H6237]] of your grain [[H2233]] and vintage [[H3754]] and give it [[H5414]] to his officials [[H5631]] and servants. [[H5650]] 
16 And [[H853]] he will take [[H3947]] your menservants [[H5650]] and [[H853]] maidservants [[H8198]] and [[H853]] your best [[H2896]] cattle [[H970]] and donkeys [[H2543]] and put [them] [[H6213]] to his own use. [[H4399]] 
17 He will take a tenth [[H6237]] of your flocks, [[H6629]] and you yourselves [[H859]] will become [[H1961]] his  slaves. [[H5650]] 
18 When that [[H1931]] day comes, [[H3117]] you will beg [[H2199]] for relief from [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] you have chosen, [[H977]] but the LORD [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] answer you [[H6030]] on that [[H1931]] day.” [[H3117]] 
19 Nevertheless, the people [[H5971]] refused [[H3985]] to listen [[H8085]] to Samuel. [[H8050]] “No!” [[H3808]] they said. [[H559]] “We must have [[H1961]] a king [[H4428]] over us. [[H5921]] 
20 Then we will [[H587]] be [[H1961]] like all [[H3605]] the other nations, [[H1471]] with a king [[H4428]] to judge us, [[H8199]] to go out [[H3318]] before us, [[H6440]] and to fight [[H3898]] our battles.” [[H4421]] 
21 Samuel [[H8050]] listened [[H8085]] to all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the people [[H5971]] and repeated them [[H1696]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
22 “Listen [[H8085]] to their voice,” [[H6963]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to Samuel. [[H8050]] “Appoint a king [[H4427]] for them.” [[H4428]] Then Samuel [[H8050]] told [[H559]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “Everyone [[H376]] must go back [[H1980]] to his city.” [[H5892]]
