1 Then David [[H1732]] fled [[H1272]] from Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah. [[H7414]] He came [[H935]] to [[H6440]] Jonathan [[H3083]] and asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] have I done? [[H6213]] What [is] [[H4100]] my iniquity? [[H5771]] How [[H4100]] have I sinned [[H2403]] against [[H6440]] your father, [[H1]] that [[H3588]] he wants to take [[H1245]] my life?” [[H5315]] 
2 “Far from it!” [[H2486]] Jonathan replied. [[H559]] “You will not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] Indeed, [[H2009]] my father [[H1]] does nothing, [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] or [[H176]] small, [[H6996]] without [[H3808]] telling [[H1540]] me. [[H241]] So why [[H4069]] would he [[H1]] hide [[H5641]] this [[H2088]] matter [[H1697]] from me? [[H4480]] This cannot be true!” [[H369]] 
3 But David [[H1732]] again [[H5750]] vowed, [[H7650]] “Your father [[H1]] knows very well [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] and he has said, [[H559]] ‘Jonathan [[H3083]] must not [[H408]] know [[H3045]] of this, [[H2063]] or [[H6435]] he will be grieved.’ [[H6087]] As surely as [[H199]] the LORD [[H3068]] lives [[H2416]] and as you [[H5315]] yourself live, [[H2416]] there is but a step [[H6587]] between me [[H996]] and [[H996]] death. [[H4194]] 
4 Then Jonathan [[H3083]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “Whatever [[H4100]] you [[H5315]] desire, [[H559]] I will do for you.” [[H6213]] 
5 So David [[H1732]] told [[H559]] him, [[H3083]] “Look, [[H2009]] tomorrow [[H4279]] is the New Moon, [[H2320]] and I am [[H595]] supposed to dine [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] the king. [[H4428]] Instead, let me go [[H7971]] and hide [[H5641]] in the field [[H7704]] until [[H5704]] the third [[H7992]] evening {from now}. [[H6153]] 
6 If [[H518]] your father [[H1]] misses me [[H6485]] at all, [[H6485]] tell him, [[H559]] ‘David [[H1732]] urgently requested [[H7592]] my [permission] [[H7592]] to hurry [[H7323]] to Bethlehem, [[H1035]] his hometown, [[H5892]] because [[H3588]] there is [[H8033]] an annual [[H3117]] sacrifice [[H2077]] for his whole [[H3605]] clan.’ [[H4940]] 
7 If [[H518]] he says, [[H559]] ‘Good,’ [[H2896]] then your servant [[H5650]] is safe, [[H7965]] but if [[H518]] he is enraged, [[H2734]] you will know [[H3045]] he has evil [[H7451]] intentions. [[H3615]] 
8 Therefore deal [[H6213]] faithfully [[H2617]] with [[H5921]] your servant, [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] you have brought [[H935]] me [[H5650]] into a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] you before the LORD. [[H3068]] If [[H518]] there is [[H3426]] iniquity [[H5771]] in me,  then kill [[H4191]] me yourself; [[H859]] why [[H4100]] should you bring [[H935]] me to [[H5704]] your father?” [[H1]] 
9 “Never!” [[H2486]] Jonathan [[H3083]] replied. [[H559]] “If [[H518]] I ever found out [[H3045]] my father [[H1]] has evil [[H7451]] intentions [[H3615]] against you, [[H5921]] would I not [[H3808]] tell you?” [[H5046]] 
10 Then David [[H1732]] asked [[H559]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] “Who [[H4310]] will tell [[H5046]] me if [[H176]] your father [[H1]] answers [[H6030]] you harshly?” [[H7186]] 
11 “Come,” [[H1980]] he [[H3083]] replied, [[H559]] “let us go out [[H3318]] to the field.” [[H7704]] So the two [[H8147]] of them went out [[H3318]] into the field, [[H7704]] 
12 and Jonathan [[H3083]] said, [[H559]] “By the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I will sound out [[H2713]] my father [[H1]] by this time [[H6256]] tomorrow [[H4279]] or the next day. [[H7992]] If [[H2009]] he is favorable [[H2896]] toward [[H413]] you, [[H1732]] will I not [[H3808]] send [[H7971]] for you [[H413]] and tell [[H1540]] you? [[H241]] 
13 But if [[H3588]] my father [[H1]] intends [[H3190]] to [[H413]] bring evil [[H7451]] on you, [[H5921]] then may the LORD [[H3068]] punish [[H3541]] me, [[H3083]] and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if I do not tell [[H1540]] you [[H241]] and send you on your way [[H7971]] in safety. [[H7965]] May the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with you, [[H5973]] just as [[H834]] He has been [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] my father. [[H1]] 
14 And [[H3808]] as long as [[H518]] I live, [[H2416]] treat [[H6213]] me [[H5978]] with the LORD’s [[H3068]] loving devotion [[H2617]] that I may not [[H3808]] die, [[H4191]] 
15 and do not [[H3808]] ever [[H5704]] cut off [[H3772]] your loving devotion [[H2617]] from [[H5973]] my household— [[H1004]] not [[H3808]] even when the LORD [[H3068]] cuts off [[H3772]] every one [[H376]] of David’s [[H1732]] enemies [[H341]] from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth.” [[H127]] 
16 So Jonathan [[H3083]] made a covenant [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of David, saying, [[H1732]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] hold [[H3027]] David’s [[H1732]] enemies [[H341]] accountable.” [[H1245]] 
17 And Jonathan [[H3083]] had David [[H1732]] reaffirm [[H3254]] his vow [[H7650]] out of love [[H160]] for him, [[H853]] for [[H3588]] [Jonathan] loved [David] [[H157]] as he loved [[H160]] himself. [[H5315]] 
18 Then Jonathan [[H3083]] said [[H559]] to David,  “Tomorrow [[H4279]] is the New Moon, [[H2320]] and you will be missed [[H6485]] if [[H3588]] your seat [[H4186]] is empty. [[H6485]] 
19 [When] you have stayed three days, [[H8027]] hurry [[H3966]] down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] you hid [[H5641]] on the day [[H3117]] this trouble began, [[H4639]] and remain [[H3427]] beside [[H681]] the stone [[H68]] Ezel. [[H237]] 
20 I [[H589]] will shoot [[H3384]] three [[H7969]] arrows [[H2678]] to the side of it, [[H6654]] as if I were aiming [[H7971]] at a target. [[H4307]] 
21 Then I will send [[H7971]] a boy [and say], [[H5288]] ‘Go, [[H1980]] find [[H4672]] the arrows!’ [[H2678]] Now, if [[H518]] I expressly say [[H559]] to him, [[H5288]] ‘Look, [[H2009]] the arrows [[H2678]] are on this side [[H2008]] of you; [[H4480]] bring them,’ [[H3947]] then come, [[H935]] because [[H3588]] as surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] it is safe [[H7965]] for you  and there is no [[H369]] danger. [[H1697]] 
22 But if [[H518]] I say [[H559]] to the young man, [[H5958]] ‘Look, [[H2009]] the arrows [are] [[H2678]] beyond you,’ [[H4480]] then [[H1973]] you must go, [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has sent you away. [[H7971]] 
23 And as for the matter [[H1697]] you [[H859]] and I [[H589]] have discussed, [[H1696]] the LORD [[H3068]] is a witness between [[H996]] you and me [[H996]] forever.” [[H5704]] 
24 So David [[H1732]] hid [[H5641]] in the field, [[H7704]] and when the New Moon [[H2320]] had come, [[H1961]] the king [[H4428]] sat down [[H3427]] to eat. [[H398]] 
25 He [[H4428]] sat [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] his usual [[H6471]] place [[H4186]] by the wall, [[H7023]] opposite [[H6965]] Jonathan [[H3083]] and [[H3427]] beside [[H6654]] Abner, [[H74]] but David’s [[H1732]] place [[H4725]] was empty. [[H6485]] 
26 Saul [[H7586]] said [[H1696]] nothing [[H3808]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] he thought, [[H559]] “Something has happened to [[H4745]] [David] [[H1931]] to make him ceremonially unclean— [[H1115]] surely [[H3588]] he [is] [[H1931]] unclean.” [[H3808]] 
27 But [[H1961]] on the day after [[H4283]] the New Moon, [[H2320]] the second [day], [[H8145]] David’s [[H1732]] place [[H4725]] was still empty, [[H6485]] and Saul [[H7586]] asked [[H559]] his son [[H1121]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] “Why [[H4069]] hasn't [[H3808]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the meal [[H3899]] either [[H1571]] yesterday [[H8543]] or today? [[H1571]] 
28 Jonathan [[H3083]] answered, [[H6030]] “David [[H1732]] urgently requested [[H7592]] my permission to [[H5704]] go to Bethlehem, [[H1035]] 
29 saying, [[H559]] ‘Please [[H4994]] let me go [[H7971]] because [[H3588]] our clan [[H4940]] is holding a sacrifice [[H2077]] in the city, [[H5892]] and my brother [[H251]] has told [[H6680]] me to be there.  So now, [[H6258]] if [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] please [[H4994]] let me go [[H4422]] and see [[H7200]] my brothers.’ [[H251]] That is why [[H5921]] he did not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king’s [[H4428]] table. [[H7979]] 
30 Then Saul's [[H7586]] anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against Jonathan, [[H3083]] and he said [[H559]] to him,  “You son [[H1121]] of a perverse [[H5753]] and rebellious woman! [[H4780]] Do I not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] have chosen [[H977]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] to your own shame [[H1322]] and to the disgrace [[H1322]] of the mother [[H517]] who bore you? [[H6172]] 
31 Every [[H3605]] day [[H3117]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] lives [[H2416]] on [[H5921]] earth, [[H127]] neither [[H3808]] you [[H859]] nor your kingship [[H4438]] shall be established. [[H3559]] Now [[H6258]] send for him [[H7971]] and bring [[H3947]] him [[H853]] to me, [[H413]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] must surely die!” [[H4194]] 
32 “Why [[H4100]] must he be put to death? [[H4191]] Jonathan [[H3083]] replied. [[H6030]] “What [[H4100]] has he done?” [[H6213]] 
33 Then Saul [[H7586]] hurled [[H2904]] his spear [[H2595]] at [Jonathan] [[H5921]] to kill him; [[H5221]] so Jonathan [[H3083]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] his father [[H1]] was determined [[H3617]] to kill [[H4191]] David. [[H1732]] 
34 Jonathan [[H3083]] got up [[H6965]] from [[H5973]] the table [[H7979]] in fierce [[H2750]] anger [[H639]] and did not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] any food [[H3899]] that second [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] of the month, [[H2320]] for [[H3588]] he was grieved [[H6087]] by [[H3588]] his father’s [[H1]] shameful treatment [[H3637]] of [[H413]] David. [[H1732]] 
35 In the morning [[H1242]] Jonathan [[H3083]] went out [[H3318]] to the field [[H7704]] for the appointment [[H4150]] with David, [[H1732]] and a small [[H6996]] boy [[H5288]] was with him. [[H5973]] 
36 He said [[H559]] to the boy, [[H5288]] “Run [[H7323]] and find [[H4672]] [the arrows] I [[H595]] shoot.” [[H3384]] And as the boy [[H5288]] ran, [[H7323]] Jonathan [[H1931]] shot [[H3384]] an arrow [[H2678]] beyond him. [[H5674]] 
37 When the boy [[H5288]] reached [[H935]] the place where [[H4725]] Jonathan's [[H3083]] arrow [[H2678]] had fallen, [[H3384]] Jonathan [[H3083]] called [[H7121]] to [[H310]] him, [[H5288]] “Isn't [[H3808]] the arrow [[H2678]] beyond you?” [[H4480]] 
38 Then Jonathan [[H3083]] cried out, [[H7121]] “Hurry! [[H4120]] Make haste! [[H2363]] Do not [[H408]] delay!” [[H5975]] So the boy [[H5288]] picked up the arrow [[H3950]] and returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] his master. [[H113]] 
39 But the boy [[H5288]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] anything; [[H3972]] only [[H389]] Jonathan [[H3083]] and David [[H1732]] knew [[H3045]] the arrangement. [[H1697]] 
40 Then Jonathan [[H3083]] gave [[H5414]] his equipment [[H3627]] to [[H413]] the boy [[H5288]] and said, [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] take it back [[H935]] to the city.” [[H5892]] 
41 When the young man [[H5288]] had gone, [[H935]] David [[H1732]] got up [[H6965]] from the south [[H5045]] side [of the stone], [[H681]] fell [[H5307]] facedown, [[H639]] and bowed [[H7812]] three [[H7969]] times. [[H6471]] Then he and Jonathan kissed [[H5401]] each [[H376]] other [[H7453]] and wept [[H1058]] together— [[H376]] though [[H5704]] David [[H1732]] wept more. [[H1431]] 
42 And Jonathan [[H3083]] said [[H559]] to David, [[H1732]] “Go [[H1980]] in peace, [[H7965]] for [[H834]] the two of us [[H8147]] have sworn [[H7650]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] when we [[H587]] said, [[H559]] ‘May the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] a witness between [[H996]] you and me, [[H996]] and between [[H996]] your descendants [[H2233]] and [[H996]] mine [[H2233]] forever. [[H5704]] Then David got up [[H6965]] and departed, [[H1980]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] went back [[H935]] into the city. [[H5892]]
