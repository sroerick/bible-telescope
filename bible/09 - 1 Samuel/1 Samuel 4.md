# 1 Samuel 4
[[1 Samuel 3|←]] • [[1 Samuel 5|→]]
1 Thus the word [[H1697]] of Samuel [[H8050]] came [[H1961]] to all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] Now the Israelites [[H3478]] went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7122]] the Philistines [[H6430]] in battle [[H4421]] and camped [[H2583]] at [[H5921]] Ebenezer, [[H72]] while the Philistines [[H6430]] camped [[H2583]] at Aphek. [[H663]] 
2 The Philistines [[H6430]] arrayed themselves [[H6186]] against [[H7122]] Israel, [[H3478]] and as the battle [[H4421]] spread, [[H5203]] Israel [[H3478]] was defeated [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] who struck down [[H5221]] about four [[H702]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] on the battlefield. [[H4634]] 
3 When the troops [[H5971]] returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] the camp, [[H4264]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] asked, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] has the LORD [[H3068]] brought defeat on us [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] the Philistines [[H6430]] today? [[H3117]] Let us bring [[H3947]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] from Shiloh, [[H7887]] so that it may go [[H935]] with us [[H7130]] to deliver us [[H3467]] from the hand [[H3709]] of our enemies. [[H341]] 
4 So the people [[H5971]] sent [[H7971]] [men] to Shiloh, [[H7887]] and they brought [[H5375]] back [[H8033]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] who sits enthroned [[H3427]] between the cherubim. [[H3742]] And the two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] of Eli, [[H5941]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas, [[H6372]] were there [[H8033]] with [[H5973]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of God. [[H430]] 
5 When [[H1961]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] entered [[H935]] the camp, [[H4264]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] raised [[H1419]] such a great [[H8643]] shout [[H7321]] that it shook [[H1949]] the ground. [[H776]] 
6 On hearing [[H8085]] the noise [[H6963]] of the shout, [[H8643]] the Philistines [[H6430]] asked, [[H559]] “What is [[H4100]] this [[H2063]] loud [[H1419]] shouting [[H8643]] in the camp [[H4264]] of the Hebrews?” [[H5680]] And when they realized [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had entered [[H935]] the camp, [[H4264]] 
7 the Philistines [[H6430]] were afraid. [[H3372]] “The gods [[H430]] have entered [[H935]] their camp!” [[H4264]] they said. [[H559]] “Woe [[H188]] to us,  for [[H3588]] nothing [[H3808]] like this [[H2063]] has happened [[H1961]] before. [[H865]] 
8 Woe [[H188]] to us!  Who [[H4310]] will deliver us [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3027]] of these [[H428]] mighty [[H117]] gods? [[H430]] These [[H428]] are the gods [[H430]] who struck [[H5221]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] with all kinds [[H3605]] of plagues [[H4347]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
9 Take courage [[H2388]] and be [[H1961]] men, [[H376]] O Philistines! [[H6430]] Otherwise, [[H6435]] you will serve [[H5647]] the Hebrews [[H5680]] just as [[H834]] they served [[H5647]] you.  Now be [[H1961]] men [[H376]] and fight!” [[H3898]] 
10 So the Philistines [[H6430]] fought, [[H3898]] and Israel [[H3478]] was defeated, [[H5062]] and each man [[H376]] fled [[H5127]] to his tent. [[H168]] The slaughter [[H4347]] was [[H1961]] very [[H3966]] great— [[H1419]] thirty [[H7970]] thousand [[H505]] foot soldiers [[H7273]] of Israel [[H3478]] fell. [[H5307]] 
11 The ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] was captured, [[H3947]] and Eli’s [[H5941]] two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas, [[H6372]] died. [[H4191]] 
12 That same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] a Benjamite [[H1144]] ran [[H7323]] from the battle line [[H4634]] all the way [[H935]] to Shiloh, [[H7887]] with his clothes [[H4055]] torn [[H7167]] and dirt [[H127]] on [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]] 
13 When he arrived, [[H935]] there [[H2009]] was Eli [[H5941]] sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his chair [[H3678]] beside [[H5221]] the road, [[H1870]] watching, [[H6822]] because [[H3588]] his heart [[H3820]] trembled [[H2730]] for [[H5921]] the ark [[H727]] of God. [[H430]] When the man [[H376]] entered [[H935]] the city [[H5892]] to give a report, [[H5046]] the whole [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] cried out. [[H2199]] 
14 Eli [[H5941]] heard [[H8085]] the outcry [[H6963]] and asked, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] commotion?” [[H1995]] So the man [[H376]] hurried over [[H4116]] and reported [[H5046]] to Eli. [[H5941]] 
15 Now Eli [[H5941]] was ninety-eight [[H8673]] years old, [[H1121]] and his gaze [[H5869]] was fixed [[H6965]] because he could not [[H3808]] see. [[H7200]] 
16 “I [[H595]] have just come [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the battle,” [[H4634]] the man [[H376]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Eli. [[H5941]] “I [[H589]] fled [[H5127]] from [[H4480]] there today.” [[H4634]] “What [[H4100]] happened, [[H1961]] my son?” [[H1121]] Eli asked. [[H559]] 
17 The messenger [[H1319]] answered, [[H6030]] “Israel [[H3478]] has fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and [[H1571]] there has been [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] slaughter [[H4046]] among the people. [[H5971]] Your two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas, [[H6372]] are both dead, [[H4191]] and the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] has been captured.” [[H3947]] 
18 As soon as [[H1961]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] was mentioned, [[H2142]] Eli fell [[H5307]] backward [[H322]] from [[H5921]] his chair [[H3678]] by [[H3027]] the city gate, [[H8179]] and being [[H3588]] old [[H2204]] and heavy, [[H3515]] he broke [[H7665]] his neck [[H4665]] and died. [[H4191]] Eli [[H1931]] had judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]] 
19 Now Eli’s daughter-in-law, [[H3618]] the wife [[H802]] of Phinehas, [[H6372]] was pregnant [[H2030]] and about to give birth. [[H3205]] When she heard [[H8085]] the news [[H8052]] of [[H413]] the capture [[H3947]] of God’s [[H430]] ark [[H727]] and the deaths [[H4191]] of her father-in-law [[H2524]] and her husband, [[H376]] she collapsed [[H3766]] and gave birth, [[H3205]] for [[H3588]] her labor pains [[H6735]] came [[H2015]] upon her. [[H5921]] 
20 As [[H6256]] she was dying, [[H4191]] the women attending [[H5324]] to her [[H5921]] said, [[H1696]] “Do not [[H408]] despair, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] you have given birth to [[H3205]] a son!” [[H1121]] But she did not [[H3808]] respond [[H6030]] or pay any heed. [[H7896]] 
21 And she named [[H7121]] the boy [[H5288]] Ichabod, [[H350]] saying, [[H559]] “The glory [[H3519]] has departed [[H1540]] from Israel,” [[H3478]] because [[H413]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] had been captured [[H3947]] [and] [[H413]] her father-in-law [[H2524]] and her husband had been killed. [[H376]] 
22 “The glory [[H3519]] has departed [[H1540]] from Israel,” [[H3478]] she said, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] has been captured.” [[H3947]]
