1 Then the Ziphites [[H2130]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] at Gibeah [[H1390]] and said, [[H559]] “Is not [[H3808]] David [[H1732]] hiding [[H5641]] on the hill [[H1389]] of Hachilah, [[H2444]] opposite [[H5921]] Jeshimon?” [[H3452]] 
2 So Saul, [[H7586]] accompanied by [[H854]] three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] choice men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Ziph [[H2128]] to search for [[H1245]] David [[H1732]] there. [[H4057]] 
3 Saul [[H7586]] camped [[H2583]] beside [[H5921]] the road [[H1870]] at the hill [[H1389]] of Hachilah [[H2444]] opposite [[H5921]] Jeshimon, [[H3452]] but David [[H1732]] was living [[H3427]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] When he realized [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] had followed [[H935]] him [[H310]] there, [[H4057]] 
4 David [[H1732]] sent out [[H7971]] spies [[H7270]] to verify [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] had arrived. [[H935]] 
5 Then David [[H1732]] set out [[H6965]] and went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] had camped. [[H2583]] He [[H1732]] saw [[H7200]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] and Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] the general [[H8269]] of his army, [[H6635]] had lain down. [[H7901]] Saul [[H7586]] was lying [[H7901]] inside the inner circle of the camp, [[H4570]] with the troops [[H5971]] camped [[H2583]] around him. [[H5439]] 
6 And David [[H1732]] asked [[H6030]] Ahimelech [[H288]] the Hittite [[H2850]] and Abishai [[H52]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] Joab’s [[H3097]] brother, [[H251]] “Who [[H4310]] will go down [[H3381]] with me [[H854]] into [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] to [[H413]] Saul?” [[H7586]] “I will [[H589]] go [[H3381]] with you,” [[H5973]] answered [[H559]] Abishai. [[H52]] 
7 That night [[H3915]] David [[H1732]] and Abishai [[H52]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the troops, [[H5971]] and Saul [[H7586]] was lying [[H7901]] there [[H2009]] asleep [[H3463]] in the inner circle of the camp, [[H4570]] with his spear [[H2595]] stuck [[H4600]] in the ground [[H776]] by his head. [[H4763]] And Abner [[H74]] and the troops [[H5971]] were lying [[H7901]] around him. [[H5439]] 
8 Abishai [[H52]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “Today [[H3117]] God [[H430]] has delivered [[H5462]] your enemy [[H341]] into your hand. [[H3027]] Now, therefore, [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] let me thrust the spear [[H2595]] through him [[H5221]] into the ground [[H776]] with one [[H259]] stroke. [[H6471]] I will not [[H3808]] need to strike him twice!” [[H8138]] 
9 But David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abishai, [[H52]] “Do not [[H408]] destroy him, [[H7843]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] can lift [[H7971]] a hand [[H3027]] against the LORD’s [[H3068]] anointed [[H4899]] and be guiltless?” [[H5352]] 
10 David [[H1732]] added, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] the LORD Himself [[H3068]] will strike him down; [[H5062]] either [[H176]] his day [[H3117]] will come [[H935]] and he will die, [[H4191]] or [[H176]] he will go [[H3381]] into battle [[H4421]] and perish. [[H5595]] 
11 But the LORD [[H3068]] forbid [[H2486]] that I  should stretch out [[H7971]] my hand [[H3027]] against the LORD’s [[H3068]] anointed. [[H4899]] Instead, [[H6258]] take [[H3947]] the spear [[H2595]] and water [[H4325]] jug [[H6835]] by his head, [[H4763]] and let us go.” [[H1980]] 
12 So David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] the spear [[H2595]] and water [[H4325]] jug [[H6835]] by Saul’s head, [[H7586]] and they departed. [[H1980]] No [[H369]] one saw them [[H7200]] [or] [[H369]] knew about it, [[H3045]] nor did anyone [[H369]] wake up; [[H6974]] they all [[H3605]] remained asleep, [[H3462]] because [[H3588]] a deep sleep [[H8639]] from the LORD [[H3068]] had fallen [[H5307]] on them. [[H5921]] 
13 Then David [[H1732]] crossed [[H5674]] to the other side [[H5676]] and stood [[H5975]] atop [[H7218]] the mountain [[H2022]] at a distance— [[H7350]] there was a wide [[H7227]] gulf [[H4725]] between them. [[H996]] 
14 And David [[H1732]] shouted [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the troops [[H5971]] and to [[H413]] Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] “Aren’t [[H3808]] you going to answer me, [[H6030]] Abner?” [[H74]] “Who [[H4310]] calls [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the king?” [[H4428]] Abner [[H74]] replied. [[H6030]] 
15 So David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Abner, [[H74]] “You are [[H859]] a man, [[H376]] aren’t you? [[H3808]] And who [[H4310]] in Israel [[H3478]] is your equal? [[H3644]] Why then [[H4100]] did you not [[H3808]] protect [[H8104]] your lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] when [[H3588]] one [[H259]] of the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to destroy him? [[H7843]] 
16 This [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] you have done [[H6213]] is not [[H3808]] good. [[H2896]] As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] all of you [[H1121]] deserve to die, [[H4194]] since you [[H859]] did not [[H3808]] protect [[H8104]] your lord, [[H113]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] anointed. [[H4899]] Now [[H6258]] look around. [[H7200]] Where [[H335]] are the king’s [[H4428]] spear [[H2595]] and water [[H4325]] jug [[H6835]] that [[H834]] were by his head? [[H4763]] 
17 Then Saul [[H7586]] recognized [[H5234]] David’s [[H1732]] voice [[H6963]] and asked, [[H559]] “Is that [[H2088]] your voice, [[H6963]] David [[H1732]] my son?” [[H1121]] “It is my voice, [[H6963]] my lord [[H113]] and king,” [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] said. [[H559]] 
18 And he continued, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] is my lord [[H113]] pursuing [[H7291]] his servant? [[H5650]] What [[H4100]] have I done? [[H6213]] What [[H4100]] evil [[H7451]] is in my hand? [[H3027]] 
19 Now [[H6258]] please, [[H4994]] may my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of his servant: [[H5650]] If [[H518]] the LORD [[H3068]] has stirred you up [[H5496]] against me,  then may He accept [[H7306]] an offering. [[H4503]] But if [[H518]] men [have done it], [[H1121]] may they [[H1992]] be cursed [[H779]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD! [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] they have driven me away [[H1644]] from sharing [[H5596]] in the inheritance [[H5159]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]] 
20 So [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] let my blood [[H1818]] fall [[H5307]] to the ground [[H776]] far from [[H5048]] the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] has come out [[H3318]] to look for [[H1245]] a [[H259]] flea, [[H6550]] like [[H834]] one who hunts [[H7291]] a partridge [[H7124]] in the mountains.” [[H2022]] 
21 Then Saul [[H7586]] replied, [[H559]] “I have sinned. [[H2398]] Come back, [[H7725]] David, [[H1732]] my son. [[H1121]] I will never [[H3808]] harm [[H7489]] you  again, [[H5750]] because [[H8478]] today [[H3117]] you considered [[H5869]] my life [[H5315]] precious. [[H3365]] I have played the fool! [[H5528]] I have committed a grave [[H7235]] error.” [[H7686]] 
22 “Here [[H2009]] is the king’s [[H4428]] spear,” [[H2595]] David [[H1732]] answered. [[H6030]] “Let one of [[H259]] the young men [[H5288]] come over [[H5674]] and get it. [[H3947]] 
23 May the LORD [[H3068]] repay [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] for his righteousness [[H6666]] and [[H853]] faithfulness. [[H530]] For [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] delivered you [[H5414]] into [my] hand [[H3027]] today, [[H3117]] but [[H3808]] I would not [[H14]] stretch out [[H7971]] my hand [[H3027]] against the LORD's [[H3068]] anointed. [[H4899]] 
24 As surely as [[H2009]] I valued [[H5869]] your life [[H5315]] today, [[H3117]] so [[H3651]] may the LORD [[H3068]] value [[H5869]] my life [[H5315]] and rescue me [[H5337]] from all [[H3605]] trouble.” [[H6869]] 
25 Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] him, [[H1732]] “[May] you [[H859]] [be] blessed, [[H1288]] my son [[H1121]] David. [[H1732]] You will [[H1571]] accomplish [[H6213]] great things [[H6213]] and [[H1571]] will surely prevail.” [[H3201]] So David [[H1732]] went [[H1980]] on his way, [[H1870]] and Saul [[H7586]] returned [[H7725]] home.
