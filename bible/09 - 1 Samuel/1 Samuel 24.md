# 1 Samuel 24
[[1 Samuel 23|←]] • [[1 Samuel 25|→]]
1 After [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] had returned [[H7725]] from pursuing [[H310]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] he was told, [[H5046]] “David [[H1732]] is in the wilderness [[H4057]] of  En-gedi.” [[H5872]] 
2 So Saul [[H7586]] took [[H3947]] three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] chosen [[H970]] men [[H376]] from all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and went [[H1980]] to look for [[H1245]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] in [[H5921]] the region [[H6440]] of the Rocks [[H6697]] of the Wild Goats. [[H3277]] 
3 Soon Saul came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the sheepfolds [[H6629]] along [[H5921]] the road, [[H1870]] where there was [[H8033]] a cave, [[H4631]] and he [[H7586]] went in [[H935]] to relieve [[H5526]] himself. [[H7272]] And David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] were hiding [[H3427]] in the recesses [[H3411]] of the cave. [[H4631]] 
4 The men [[H376]] of David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “This is [[H2009]] the day [[H3117]] about which the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to you, [[H413]] ‘Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will deliver [[H5414]] your enemy [[H341]] into your hands [[H3027]] to do [[H6213]] with him  as [[H834]] you wish.’” [[H3190]] Then David [[H1732]] crept up [[H6965]] secretly [[H3909]] and cut off [[H3772]] a corner [[H3671]] of Saul's [[H7586]] robe. [[H4598]] 
5 Afterward, [[H310]] David’s [[H1732]] conscience [[H3820]] was stricken [[H5221]] because [[H5921]] he had cut off [[H3772]] the corner [[H3671]] of Saul’s robe. [[H7586]] 
6 So he said [[H559]] to his men, [[H582]] “The LORD [[H3069]] forbid [[H2486]] that [[H518]] I  should do [[H6213]] such [[H2088]] a thing [[H1697]] to my master, [[H113]] the LORD’s [[H3069]] anointed. [[H4899]] I will never lift [[H7971]] my hand against him, [[H3027]] since [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is the LORD’s [[H3069]] anointed.” [[H4899]] 
7 With these words [[H1697]] David [[H1732]] restrained [[H8156]] his men, [[H376]] and he did not [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] them rise up [[H6965]] against [[H413]] Saul. [[H7586]] Then Saul [[H7586]] left [[H6965]] the cave [[H4631]] and went [[H1980]] on his way. [[H1870]] 
8 After [[H310]] that, [[H3651]] David [[H1732]] got up, [[H6965]] went out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the cave, [[H4631]] and called out [[H7121]] to [[H310]] Saul, [[H7586]] “My lord [[H113]] the king!” [[H4428]] When Saul [[H7586]] looked [[H5027]] behind him, [[H310]] David [[H1732]] bowed [[H6915]] facedown [[H639]] in reverence [[H7812]] 
9 and [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Saul, [[H7586]] “Why [[H4100]] do you listen [[H8085]] to the words [[H1697]] of men [[H120]] who say, [[H559]] ‘Look, [[H2009]] David [[H1732]] intends [[H1245]] to harm you’? [[H7451]] 
10 Behold, [[H2009]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] you have seen [[H7200]] with your own eyes [[H5869]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] delivered you [[H5414]] into my hand [[H3027]] in the cave. [[H4631]] I was told [[H559]] to kill you, [[H2026]] but I spared [[H2347]] you [[H5921]] and said, [[H559]] ‘I will not [[H3808]] lift [[H7971]] my hand [[H3027]] against my lord, [[H113]] since [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is the LORDs [[H3068]] anointed. [[H4899]] 
11 See, [[H7200]] my father, [[H1]] look [[H7200]] at the corner [[H3671]] of your robe [[H4598]] in my hand. [[H3027]] For [[H3588]] I cut it [[H3671]] off, [[H3772]] but I did not [[H3808]] kill you. [[H2026]] See [[H7200]] and know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] evil [[H7451]] or rebellion [[H6588]] in my hands. [[H3027]] I have not [[H3808]] sinned [[H2398]] against you,  even though you [[H859]] are hunting me down [[H6658]] to take [[H3947]] my life. [[H5315]] 
12 May the LORD [[H3068]] judge [[H8199]] between you and me, [[H996]] and may the LORD [[H3068]] take vengeance [[H5358]] on you, [[H4480]] but my hand [[H3027]] will never [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] against you.  
13 As [[H834]] the old [[H6931]] proverb [[H4912]] says, [[H559]] ‘Wickedness [[H7562]] proceeds [[H3318]] from the wicked.’ [[H7561]] But my hand [[H3027]] will never [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] against you.  
14 Against [[H310]] whom [[H4310]] has the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] come out? [[H3318]] Whom [[H4310]] are you [[H859]] pursuing? [[H7291]] A dead [[H4191]] dog? [[H3611]] A [[H259]] flea? [[H6550]] 
15 May the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] our judge [[H1781]] and decide [[H8199]] between you and me. [[H996]] May He take notice [[H7200]] and plead [[H7378]] my case [[H7379]] and deliver me [[H8199]] from your hand.” [[H3027]] 
16 When David [[H1732]] had finished [[H3615]] saying [[H1696]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] Saul [[H7586]] called back, [[H559]] “Is that [[H2088]] your voice, [[H6963]] David [[H1732]] my son?” [[H1121]] Then Saul [[H7586]] wept [[H1058]] aloud [[H5375]] 
17 and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “You [[H859]] are more righteous [[H6662]] than I, [[H4480]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] have rewarded me [[H1580]] with good, [[H2896]] though I [[H589]] have rewarded you [[H1580]] with evil. [[H7451]] 
18 And you [[H859]] have shown [[H5046]] this day [[H3117]] how [[H834]] well [[H2896]] you have dealt [[H6213]] with me; [[H854]] for when [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] delivered me [[H5462]] into your hand, [[H3027]] you did not [[H3808]] kill me. [[H2026]] 
19 When [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] finds [[H4672]] his enemy, [[H341]] does he let him go [[H7971]] away [[H1870]] unharmed? [[H2896]] May the LORD [[H3068]] reward you [[H7999]] with good [[H2896]] for [[H8478]] what [[H834]] you have done [[H6213]] for me  this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
20 Now [[H6258]] I know [[H3045]] for sure that [[H2009]] you will be king, [[H4427]] and that the kingdom [[H4467]] of Israel [[H3478]] will be established [[H6965]] in your hands. [[H3027]] 
21 So now, [[H6258]] swear [[H7650]] to me  by the LORD [[H3068]] that you will not [[H518]] cut off [[H3772]] my descendants [[H2233]] or wipe out [[H8045]] my name [[H8034]] from my father's [[H1]] house.” [[H1004]] 
22 So David [[H1732]] gave his oath [[H7650]] to Saul. [[H7586]] Then Saul [[H7586]] returned [[H1980]] home, [[H1004]] but David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] went up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] the stronghold. [[H4686]]
