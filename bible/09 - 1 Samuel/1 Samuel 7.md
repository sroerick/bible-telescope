# 1 Samuel 7
[[1 Samuel 6|←]] • [[1 Samuel 8|→]]
1 Then the men [[H376]] of Kiriath-jearim [[H7157]] came [[H935]] for the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and took [[H5927]] it [[H853]] into [[H413]] Abinadab's [[H41]] house [[H1004]] on the hill. [[H1389]] And [[H853]] they consecrated [[H6942]] his son [[H1121]] Eleazar [[H499]] to guard [[H8104]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 And from that day [[H3117]] a long [[H7235]] time [[H3117]] passed, [[H1961]] twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] in all, [[H1961]] as the ark [[H727]] remained [[H3427]] at Kiriath-jearim. [[H7157]] And all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] mourned [[H5091]] and sought after [[H310]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 Then Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “If [[H518]] you [[H859]] are returning [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] your hearts, [[H3824]] then rid yourselves of [[H5493]] the foreign [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] and Ashtoreths [[H6252]] among you, [[H8432]] prepare [[H3559]] your hearts [[H3824]] for [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and serve Him [[H5647]] only. [[H905]] And He will deliver [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] 
4 So the Israelites [[H1121]] put away [[H5493]] the Baals [[H1168]] and [[H853]] Ashtoreths [[H6252]] and served [[H5647]] only [[H905]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 Then Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] “Gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] to Mizpah, [[H4709]] and I will pray [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] on your behalf.” [[H1157]] 
6 When they had gathered [[H6908]] at Mizpah, [[H4709]] they drew [[H7579]] water [[H4325]] and poured it out [[H8210]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they fasted, [[H6684]] and there [[H8033]] they confessed, [[H559]] “We have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD.” [[H3068]] And Samuel [[H8050]] judged [[H8199]] the Israelites [[H1121]] at Mizpah. [[H4709]] 
7 When the Philistines [[H6430]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had gathered [[H6908]] at Mizpah, [[H4709]] their [[H6430]] rulers [[H5633]] marched up [[H5927]] toward [[H413]] Israel. [[H3478]] And when the Israelites [[H1121]] learned of this, [[H8085]] they feared [[H3372]] the Philistines [[H6430]] 
8 [and] [[H1121]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] “Do not [[H408]] stop [[H2790]] crying out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] for us, [[H4480]] so that He will deliver us [[H3467]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines.” [[H6430]] 
9 Then Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] a [[H259]] suckling [[H2461]] lamb [[H2924]] and offered [[H5927]] it as a whole [[H3632]] burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] He [[H8050]] cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] on behalf of [[H1157]] Israel, [[H3478]] and the LORD [[H3068]] answered him. [[H6030]] 
10 As the Philistines [[H6430]] drew near [[H5066]] to fight [[H4421]] against Israel, [[H3478]] Samuel [[H8050]] was [[H1961]] sacrificing [[H5927]] the burnt offering. [[H5930]] But that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] thundered [[H7481]] loudly [[H6963]] against [[H5921]] the Philistines [[H6430]] and threw them into such confusion [[H2000]] that they fled [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
11 Then the men [[H582]] of Israel [[H3478]] charged out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] Mizpah [[H4709]] and pursued [[H7291]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] striking them down [[H5221]] all the way to [[H8478]] an area below  Beth-car. [[H1033]] 
12 Afterward, Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] a [[H259]] stone [[H68]] and set [it] up [[H7760]] between [[H996]] Mizpah [[H4709]] and Shen. [[H8129]] He named [[H7121]] it Ebenezer, [[H72]] saying, [[H559]] “Thus [[H2008]] far [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] has helped us.” [[H5826]] 
13 So the Philistines [[H6430]] were subdued [[H3665]] and did not [[H3808]] invade [[H935]] the territory [[H1366]] of Israel [[H3478]] again. [[H3254]] And the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] against the Philistines [[H6430]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Samuel. [[H8050]] 
14 The cities [[H5892]] from Ekron [[H6138]] to [[H5704]] Gath, [[H1661]] which [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had taken, [[H3947]] were restored [[H7725]] to Israel, [[H3478]] [who] [[H3478]] also delivered [[H5337]] the surrounding territory [[H1366]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] And there was [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] between [[H996]] the Israelites [[H3478]] and the Amorites. [[H567]] 
15 So Samuel [[H8050]] judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life. [[H2416]] 
16 Every year [[H8141]] he would go [[H1980]] on a circuit [[H5437]] from [[H1767]] Bethel [[H1008]] to Gilgal [[H1537]] to Mizpah, [[H4709]] judging [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] in [[H853]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] places. [[H4725]] 
17 Then he would return [[H8666]] to Ramah [[H7414]] because [[H3588]] his home [[H1004]] was there, [[H8033]] and there [[H8033]] he judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] and built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]
