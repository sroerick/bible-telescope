1 The second [[H8145]] lot [[H1486]] came out [[H3318]] for the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Simeon: [[H8095]] Their inheritance [[H5159]] lay [[H1961]] within [[H8432]] the territory [[H5159]] of Judah [[H3063]] 
2 and included [[H5159]] Beersheba [[H884]] (or Sheba), [[H7652]] Moladah, [[H4137]] 
3 Hazar-shual, [[H2705]] Balah, [[H1088]] Ezem, [[H6107]] 
4 Eltolad, [[H513]] Bethul, [[H1329]] Hormah, [[H2767]] 
5 Ziklag, [[H6860]] Beth-marcaboth, [[H1024]] Hazar-susah, [[H2701]] 
6 Beth-lebaoth, [[H1034]] and Sharuhen— [[H8287]] thirteen [[H7969]] cities, [[H5892]] along with their villages. [[H2691]] 
7 Ain, [[H5871]] Rimmon, [[H7417]] Ether, [[H6281]] and Ashan— [[H6228]] four [[H702]] cities, [[H5892]] along with their villages, [[H2691]] 
8 and all [[H3605]] the villages [[H2691]] surrounding [[H5439]] these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] as [[H5704]] far as Baalath-beer [[H1192]] (Ramah of the Negev). [[H7414]] This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Simeon. [[H8095]] 
9 The inheritance [[H5159]] of the Simeonites [[H8095]] was taken from the territory [[H2256]] of Judah, [[H3063]] because [[H3588]] the share [[H2506]] for Judah’s [[H3063]] descendants [[H1121]] was [[H1961]] too large [[H7227]] for them. [[H1992]] So the Simeonites [[H8095]] received an inheritance [[H5159]] within [[H8432]] Judah’s portion. [[H5159]] 
10 The third [[H7992]] lot [[H1486]] came up [[H5927]] for the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H1121]] of Zebulun: [[H2074]] The border [[H1366]] of their inheritance [[H5159]] stretched [[H1961]] as far as [[H5704]] Sarid. [[H8301]] 
11 [It] [[H1366]] went up [[H5927]] westward [[H3220]] to Maralah, [[H4831]] reached [[H6293]] Dabbesheth, [[H1708]] and met [[H6293]] the brook [[H5158]] east [[H5921]] of Jokneam. [[H3362]] 
12 From Sarid [[H8301]] it turned [[H7725]] eastward [[H6924]] along [[H5921]] the border [[H1366]] of Chisloth-tabor [[H3696]] and went [[H3318]] on to [[H413]] Daberath [[H1705]] and up [[H5927]] to Japhia. [[H3309]] 
13 From there [[H8033]] it crossed [[H5674]] eastward [[H6924]] to Gath-hepher [[H1662]] and to Eth-kazin; [[H6278]] it extended [[H3318]] to Rimmon [[H7417]] and curved [[H7417]] around toward Neah. [[H5269]] 
14 Then the border [[H1366]] circled around [[H5437]] the north side [[H6828]] [of Neah] [[H853]] to Hannathon [[H2615]] and ended [[H1961]] at the Valley of Iphtah-el. [[H1516]] 
15 It also included Kattath, [[H7005]] Nahalal, [[H5096]] Shimron, [[H8110]] Idalah, [[H3030]] and Bethlehem. [[H1035]] There were twelve [[H8147]] cities, [[H5892]] along with their villages. [[H2691]] 
16 This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H1121]] of Zebulun, [[H2074]] including these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] and their villages. [[H2691]] 
17 The fourth [[H7243]] lot [[H1486]] came out [[H3318]] for the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H1121]] of Issachar: [[H3485]] 
18 Their territory [[H1366]] included [[H1961]] Jezreel, [[H3157]] Chesulloth, [[H3694]] Shunem, [[H7766]] 
19 Hapharaim, [[H2663]] Shion, [[H7866]] Anaharath, [[H588]] 
20 Rabbith, [[H7245]] Kishion, [[H7191]] Ebez, [[H77]] 
21 Remeth, [[H7432]] En-gannim, [[H5873]] En-haddah, [[H5876]] and  Beth-pazzez. [[H1048]] 
22 The border [[H1366]] reached [[H6293]] Tabor, [[H8396]] Shahazumah, [[H7831]] and Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] and ended [[H1961]] at the Jordan. [[H3383]] There were sixteen [[H8337]] cities, [[H5892]] along with their villages. [[H2691]] 
23 This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Issachar, [[H3485]] including the cities [[H5892]] and their villages. [[H2691]] 
24 The fifth [[H2549]] lot [[H1486]] came out [[H3318]] for the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Asher: [[H836]] 
25 Their territory [[H1366]] included [[H1961]] Helkath, [[H2520]] Hali, [[H2482]] Beten, [[H991]] Achshaph, [[H407]] 
26 Allammelech, [[H487]] Amad, [[H6008]] and Mishal. [[H4861]] On the west [[H3220]] [the border] touched [[H6293]] Carmel [[H3760]] and Shihor-libnath, [[H7884]] 
27 then turned [[H7725]] eastward [[H4217]] toward  Beth-dagon, [[H1016]] touched [[H6293]] Zebulun [[H2074]] and the Valley [[H1516]] of Iphtah-el, [[H3317]] and went north [[H6828]] to Beth-emek [[H1025]] and Neiel, [[H5272]] passing [[H3318]] Cabul [[H3521]] on the left. [[H8040]] 
28 [It went on] to Ebron, [[H5683]] Rehob, [[H7340]] Hammon, [[H2540]] and Kanah, [[H7071]] as [[H5704]] far as Greater [[H7227]] Sidon. [[H6721]] 
29 The border [[H1366]] then turned back [[H7725]] toward Ramah [[H7414]] as far as [[H5704]] the fortified [[H4013]] city [[H5892]] of Tyre, [[H6865]] turned [[H7725]] toward Hosah, [[H2621]] and came out [[H1961]] at the Sea [[H3220]] in the region [[H2256]] of Achzib, [[H392]] 
30 Ummah, [[H5981]] Aphek, [[H663]] and Rehob. [[H7340]] [There were] twenty-two [[H6242]] cities, [[H5892]] along with their villages. [[H2691]] 
31 This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Asher, [[H836]] including these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] and their villages. [[H2691]] 
32 The sixth [[H8345]] lot [[H1486]] came out [[H3318]] for the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H1121]] of Naphtali: [[H5321]] 
33 Their border [[H1366]] started [[H1961]] at Heleph [[H2501]] and the great tree [[H438]] of Zaanannim, [[H6815]] passing Adami-nekeb [[H129]] and Jabneel [[H2995]] as far as [[H5704]] Lakkum [[H3946]] and ending [[H1961]] at the Jordan. [[H3383]] 
34 Then the border [[H1366]] turned [[H7725]] westward [[H3220]] to Aznoth-tabor [[H243]] and ran [[H3318]] from there [[H8033]] to Hukkok, [[H2712]] touching [[H6293]] Zebulun [[H2074]] on the south side, [[H5045]] Asher [[H836]] on the west, [[H3220]] and Judah [[H3063]] at the Jordan [[H3383]] on the east. [[H4217]] 
35 The fortified [[H4013]] cities [[H5892]] were Ziddim, [[H6661]] Zer, [[H6863]] Hammath, [[H2575]] Rakkath, [[H7557]] Chinnereth, [[H3672]] 
36 Adamah, [[H128]] Ramah, [[H7414]] Hazor, [[H2674]] 
37 Kedesh, [[H6943]] Edrei, [[H154]] En-hazor, [[H5877]] 
38 Iron, [[H3375]] Migdal-el, [[H4027]] Horem, [[H2765]] Beth-anath, [[H1043]] and Beth-shemesh. [[H1053]] [There were] nineteen [[H8672]] cities, [[H5892]] along with their villages. [[H2691]] 
39 This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] including the cities [[H5892]] and villages. [[H2691]] 
40 The seventh [[H7637]] lot [[H1486]] came out [[H3318]] for the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan: [[H1835]] 
41 The territory [[H1366]] of their inheritance [[H5159]] included Zorah, [[H6881]] Eshtaol, [[H847]] Ir-shemesh, [[H5905]] 
42 Shaalabbin, [[H8169]] Aijalon, [[H357]] Ithlah, [[H3494]] 
43 Elon, [[H356]] Timnah, [[H8553]] Ekron, [[H6138]] 
44 Eltekeh, [[H514]] Gibbethon, [[H1405]] Baalath, [[H1191]] 
45 Jehud, [[H3055]] Bene-berak, [[H1139]] Gath-rimmon, [[H1667]] 
46 Me-jarkon, [[H4313]] and Rakkon, [[H7542]] including [[H5973]] the territory [[H1366]] across from [[H4136]] Joppa. [[H3305]] 
47 (Later, when the territory [[H1366]] of the Danites [[H1121]] was lost [[H3318]] [to them], [[H1121]] they went up [[H5927]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Leshem, [[H3959]] captured it, [[H3920]] and struck it down [[H5221]] with the sword. [[H2719]] So they took possession [[H3423]] of [Leshem], [[H853]] settled [there], [[H3427]] and renamed [[H7121]] [it] [[H3959]] after [[H8034]] their father [[H1]] Dan.) [[H1835]] 
48 This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan, [[H1835]] including these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] and villages. [[H2691]] 
49 When they had finished [[H3615]] distributing [[H5157]] the land [[H776]] into its territories, [[H1367]] the Israelites [[H1121]] gave [[H5414]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] an inheritance [[H5159]] among them, [[H8432]] 
50 as [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded. [[H6310]] They gave [[H5414]] him the city [[H5892]] of Timnath-serah [[H8556]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] as [[H834]] he requested. [[H7592]] He rebuilt [[H1129]] the city [[H5892]] and settled there. [[H3427]] 
51 These [were] [[H428]] the inheritances [[H5159]] that [[H834]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and the heads [[H7218]] of the families [[H1]] distributed [[H5157]] by lot [[H1486]] to the tribes [[H4294]] of Israel [[H3478]] at Shiloh [[H7887]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] So they finished [[H3615]] dividing up [[H2505]] the land. [[H776]]
