1 Now the family [[H1]] heads [[H7218]] of the Levites [[H3881]] approached [[H5066]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and [[H413]] the heads [[H7218]] of the [other] tribes [[H4294]] of Israel [[H3478]] 
2 at Shiloh [[H7887]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] saying, [[H1696]] “The LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] through [[H3027]] Moses [[H4872]] that we be given [[H5414]] cities [[H5892]] in which to live, [[H3427]] along with pasturelands [[H4054]] for our livestock.” [[H929]] 
3 So by [[H413]] the command [[H6310]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the Israelites [[H1121]] gave [[H5414]] the Levites [[H3881]] these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] and their pasturelands [[H4054]] out of their own inheritance: [[H5159]] 
4 The [first] lot [[H1486]] came out [[H3318]] for the Kohathite [[H6956]] clans. [[H4940]] The Levites [[H3881]] who were descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] received [[H1961]] thirteen [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] by lot [[H1486]] from [[H4480]] the tribes [[H4294]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Simeon, [[H8099]] and Benjamin. [[H1144]] 
5 The remaining [[H3498]] descendants [[H1121]] of Kohath [[H6955]] received ten [[H6235]] cities [[H5892]] by lot [[H1486]] from the tribes [[H4294]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] Dan, [[H1835]] and [[H2677]] the half-tribe [[H4294]] of Manasseh. [[H4519]] 
6 The descendants [[H1121]] of Gershon [[H1648]] received thirteen [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] by lot [[H1486]] from the tribes [[H4294]] of Issachar, [[H3485]] Asher, [[H836]] Naphtali, [[H5321]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] in Bashan. [[H1316]] 
7 The descendants [[H1121]] of Merari [[H4847]] received twelve [[H8147]] cities [[H5892]] from the tribes [[H4294]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] Gad, [[H1410]] and Zebulun. [[H2074]] 
8 So the Israelites [[H1121]] allotted [[H5414]] to the Levites [[H3881]] these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] along with their pasturelands, [[H4054]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
9 From the tribes [[H4294]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Simeon, [[H8095]] they designated [[H5414]] these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] by name [[H8034]] 
10 to the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] from the Kohathite [[H6956]] clans [[H4940]] of the Levites, [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] the first [[H7223]] lot [[H1486]] fell [[H1961]] to them: [[H1992]] 
11 They gave [[H5414]] them [[H1992]] Kiriath-arba [[H7153]] (that is, [[H1931]] Hebron), [[H2275]] with its surrounding [[H5439]] pasturelands, [[H4054]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Judah. [[H3063]] (Arba was the father [[H1]] of Anak.) [[H6061]] 
12 But they had given [[H5414]] the fields [[H7704]] and villages [[H2691]] around the city [[H5892]] to Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] as his possession. [[H272]] 
13 So to the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] they gave [[H5414]] [these cities] [[H853]] with their pasturelands: [[H4054]] Hebron, [[H2275]] a city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] for the manslayer, [[H7523]] Libnah, [[H3841]] 
14 Jattir, [[H3492]] Eshtemoa, [[H851]] 
15 Holon, [[H2473]] Debir, [[H1688]] 
16 Ain, [[H5871]] Juttah, [[H3194]] and Beth-shemesh— [[H1053]] nine [[H8672]] cities [[H5892]] from [[H853]] these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] tribes, [[H7626]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
17 And from the tribe [[H4294]] of Benjamin they gave [[H1144]] them [[H853]] Gibeon, [[H1391]] Geba, [[H1387]] 
18 Anathoth, [[H6068]] and Almon— [[H5960]] four [[H702]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
19 Altogether [[H3605]] thirteen [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] with their pasturelands [[H4054]] [were given] to the priests, [[H3548]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron. [[H175]] 
20 The remaining [[H3498]] Kohathite [[H6955]] clans [[H4940]] of the Levites [[H3881]] were allotted [[H1486]] these cities: [[H5892]] From the tribe [[H4294]] of Ephraim [[H669]] 
21 they were given [[H5414]] Shechem [[H7927]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] (a city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] for the manslayer), [[H7523]] Gezer, [[H1507]] 
22 Kibzaim, [[H6911]] and Beth-horon— [[H1032]] four [[H702]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
23 From the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan [they were given] [[H1835]] Elteke, [[H514]] Gibbethon, [[H1405]] 
24 Aijalon, [[H357]] and Gath-rimmon— [[H1667]] four [[H702]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
25 And from the half-tribe [[H4276]] of Manasseh [they were given] [[H4519]] Taanach [[H8590]] and [[H853]] Gath-rimmon— [[H1667]] two [[H8147]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
26 Altogether [[H3605]] ten [[H6235]] cities [[H5892]] with their pasturelands [[H4054]] [were given] to the rest [[H3498]] of the Kohathite [[H6955]] clans. [[H4940]] 
27 [This is what] the Levite [[H3881]] clans [[H4940]] of the Gershonites [were given]: [[H1648]] From the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] [they received] [[H853]] Golan [[H1474]] in Bashan, [[H1316]] a city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] for the manslayer, [[H7523]] and Beeshterah— [[H1203]] two [[H8147]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
28 From the tribe [[H4294]] of Issachar [they received] [[H3485]] Kishion, [[H7191]] Daberath, [[H1705]] 
29 Jarmuth, [[H3412]] and En-gannim— [[H5873]] four [[H702]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
30 From the tribe [[H4294]] of Asher they received [[H836]] Mishal, [[H4861]] Abdon, [[H5658]] 
31 Helkath, [[H2520]] and Rehob— [[H7340]] four [[H702]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
32 And from the tribe [[H4294]] of Naphtali [they received] [[H5321]] Kedesh [[H6943]] in Galilee [[H1551]] (a city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] for the manslayer), [[H7523]] Hammoth-dor, [[H2576]] and Kartan— [[H7178]] three [[H7969]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
33 Altogether [[H3605]] thirteen [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] with their pasturelands [[H4054]] [were given] to the Gershonite [[H1649]] clans. [[H4940]] 
34 [This is what] the Merarite [[H4847]] clan [[H4940]] (the rest of [[H3498]] the Levites) were given: [[H3881]] From the tribe [[H4294]] of Zebulun [they received] [[H2074]] Jokneam, [[H3362]] Kartah, [[H7177]] 
35 Dimnah, [[H1829]] and Nahalal— [[H5096]] four [[H702]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
36 From the tribe [[H4294]] of Reuben [they received] [[H7205]] Bezer, [[H1221]] Jahaz, [[H3096]] 
37 Kedemoth, [[H6932]] and Mephaath— [[H4158]] four [[H702]] cities, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
38 And from the tribe [[H4294]] of Gad [they received] [[H1410]] Ramoth [[H7433]] in Gilead, [[H1568]] a city [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] for the manslayer, [[H7523]] Mahanaim, [[H4266]] 
39 Heshbon, [[H2809]] and Jazer— [[H3270]] four [[H702]] cities [[H5892]] in all, [[H3605]] along with [[H853]] their pasturelands. [[H4054]] 
40 Altogether [[H3605]] twelve [[H8147]] cities [[H5892]] were [[H1961]] allotted [[H1486]] to the clans [[H4940]] of Merari, [[H4847]] the remaining [[H3498]] Levite [[H3881]] clans. [[H4940]] 
41 So in all [[H3605]] there were forty-eight [[H705]] cities [[H5892]] for the Levites, [[H3881]] along with their pasturelands, [[H4054]] within [[H8432]] the territory [[H272]] of the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
42 Each [[H5892]] of these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] had [[H1961]] its own surrounding [[H5439]] pasturelands; [[H4054]] this was true [[H3651]] for all [[H3605]] the [[H428]] cities. [[H5892]] 
43 Thus the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] He had sworn [[H7650]] to give [[H5414]] their fathers, [[H1]] and they took possession of [[H3423]] it and settled [[H3427]] there.  
44 And the LORD [[H3068]] gave them rest [[H5117]] on every side, [[H5439]] just as [[H3605]] He had sworn [[H7650]] to their fathers. [[H1]] None [[H3808]] of their enemies [[H341]] could stand [[H5975]] against them, [[H6440]] for the LORD [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] their enemies [[H341]] into their hand. [[H3027]] 
45 Not one [[H3808]] of all [[H3605]] the LORD's [[H3068]] good [[H2896]] promises [[H1697]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] failed; [[H5307]] everything [[H3605]] was fulfilled. [[H935]]
