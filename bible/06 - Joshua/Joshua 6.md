[[Joshua 5|←]] • [[Joshua 7|→]]
1 Now Jericho [[H3405]] was tightly shut up [[H5462]] because of [[H6440]] the Israelites— [[H1121]] no one [[H369]] went out [[H3318]] and no one [[H369]] came in. [[H935]] 
2 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Behold, [[H7200]] I have delivered [[H5414]] Jericho [[H3405]] and [[H853]] its king [[H4428]] and fighting men [[H1368]] into your hands. [[H3027]] 
3 March around [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] with all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] circling [[H5362]] the city [[H5892]] one [[H259]] time. [[H6471]] Do [[H6213]] this [[H3541]] for six [[H8337]] days. [[H3117]] 
4 Have seven [[H7651]] priests [[H3548]] carry [[H5375]] seven [[H7651]] trumpets [[H7782]] of rams' horns [[H3104]] in front [[H6440]] of the ark. [[H727]] Then on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] march around [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] seven [[H7651]] times, [[H6471]] while the priests [[H3548]] blow [[H8628]] the trumpets. [[H7782]] 
5 And when [[H1961]] there is a long blast [[H4900]] of the ram's [[H3104]] horn [[H7161]] and you hear [[H8085]] [its] [[H7782]] sound, [[H6963]] have all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] give a mighty [[H1419]] shout. [[H7321]] Then the wall [[H2346]] of the city [[H5892]] will collapse, [[H5307]] and the people [[H5971]] will go up, [[H5927]] each man [[H376]] straight ahead.” [[H5048]] 
6 So Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] summoned [[H7121]] the priests [[H3548]] and said, [[H559]] “Take up [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] and have seven [[H7651]] priests [[H3548]] carry [[H5375]] seven [[H7651]] trumpets [[H7782]] in front [[H6440]] of the ark [[H727]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
7 And  he told [[H559]] the people, [[H5971]] “Advance [[H5674]] and march around [[H5437]] the city, [[H5892]] with the armed [[H2502]] troops [[H5674]] going ahead of [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
8 After Joshua [[H3091]] had spoken [[H559]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] seven [[H7651]] priests [[H3548]] carrying [[H5375]] seven [[H7651]] trumpets [[H7782]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] advanced [[H5674]] and blew [[H8628]] the trumpets, [[H7782]] and the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] followed [[H1980]] them. [[H310]] 
9 While the trumpets [[H7782]] continued to sound, [[H8628]] the armed troops [[H2502]] marched [[H1980]] ahead [[H6440]] of the priests [[H3548]] who blew [[H8628]] the trumpets, [[H7782]] and the rear guard [[H622]] followed [[H1980]] the ark. [[H727]] 
10 But Joshua [[H3091]] had commanded [[H6680]] the people: [[H5971]] “Do not [[H3808]] give a battle cry [[H7321]] or let your voice [[H6963]] be heard; [[H8085]] do not [[H3808]] let one word [[H1697]] come out [[H3318]] of your mouth [[H6310]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] I tell [[H559]] you [[H413]] to shout. [[H7321]] Then you are to shout!” [[H7321]] 
11 So he had the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] carried around [[H5437]] the city, [[H5892]] circling [[H5362]] it once. [[H6471]] And [the people] returned [[H935]] to the camp [[H4264]] and spent the night there. [[H3885]] 
12 Joshua [[H3091]] got up early [[H7925]] the next morning, [[H1242]] and the priests [[H3548]] took [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 And the seven [[H7651]] priests [[H3548]] carrying [[H5375]] seven [[H7651]] trumpets [[H7782]] kept marching [[H1980]] ahead [[H6440]] of the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and sounding [[H8628]] the trumpets. [[H7782]] The armed troops [[H2502]] went [[H1980]] in front of them, [[H6440]] and the rear guard [[H622]] followed [[H1980]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] while [the priests] kept [[H1980]] sounding [[H8628]] the trumpets. [[H7782]] 
14 So on the second [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] they marched around [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] once [[H6471]] and returned [[H7725]] to the camp. [[H4264]] They did [[H6213]] this [[H3541]] for six [[H8337]] days. [[H3117]] 
15 Then [[H1961]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] they got up [[H7925]] at dawn [[H7837]] and marched around [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] in the same [[H2088]] manner. [[H4941]] That [[H1931]] was the only [[H7535]] day [[H3117]] they circled [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] seven [[H7651]] times. [[H6471]] 
16 After the seventh [[H7637]] time around, [[H6471]] the priests [[H3548]] blew [[H8628]] the trumpets, [[H7782]] and Joshua [[H3091]] commanded [[H559]] the people, [[H5971]] “Shout! [[H7321]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has given [[H5414]] you the city! [[H5892]] 
17 Now the city [[H5892]] and everything [[H3605]] in it  must be [[H1961]] devoted [[H2764]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Only [[H7535]] Rahab [[H7343]] the prostitute [[H2181]] and all those [[H3605]] with her [[H854]] in her house [[H1004]] will live, [[H2421]] because [[H3588]] she hid [[H2244]] the spies [[H4397]] we sent. [[H7971]] 
18 But [[H7535]] keep away [[H8104]] from [[H4480]] the devoted things, [[H2764]] lest [[H6435]] you yourself be set apart for destruction. [[H2763]] If you take [[H3947]] any of [[H4480]] [these], [[H2764]] you will set [[H7760]] apart the camp [[H4264]] of Israel [[H3478]] for destruction [[H2764]] and bring disaster upon it. [[H5916]] 
19 For all [[H3605]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] and all the articles [[H3627]] of bronze [[H5178]] and iron [[H1270]] are holy [[H6944]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] they must go into [[H935]] [His] [[H3068]] treasury.” [[H214]] 
20 So when the trumpets [[H7782]] sounded, [[H8628]] the people [[H5971]] shouted. [[H7321]] When they [[H5971]] heard [[H8085]] the blast [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] the people [[H5971]] gave a great [[H1419]] shout, [[H7321]] and the wall [[H2346]] collapsed. [[H5307]] The people [[H5971]] charged [[H5927]] into the city, [[H5892]] each man [[H376]] straight ahead, [[H5048]] and captured [[H3920]] the city. [[H5892]] 
21 At the edge [[H6310]] of the sword [[H2719]] they utterly destroyed [[H2763]] everything [[H3605]] in the city— [[H5892]] man [[H376]] and woman, [[H802]] young [[H5288]] and [[H5704]] old, [[H2205]] oxen, [[H7794]] sheep, [[H7716]] and donkeys. [[H2543]] 
22 Meanwhile, Joshua [[H3091]] told [[H559]] the two [[H8147]] men [[H582]] who had spied out [[H7270]] the land, [[H776]] “Go into [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the prostitute [[H2181]] and bring out [[H3318]] the woman [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] who are with her, [[H834]] just as [[H834]] you promised her.” [[H7650]] 
23 So the young [[H5288]] spies [[H7270]] went in [[H935]] and brought out [[H3318]] Rahab, [[H7343]] her father [[H1]] and [[H853]] mother [[H517]] and [[H853]] brothers, [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] who belonged to her. [[H834]] They brought out [[H3318]] her whole [[H3605]] family [[H4940]] and settled them [[H3240]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
24 Then [the Israelites] burned up [[H8313]] the city [[H5892]] and everything in it. [[H3605]] However, [[H7535]] they put [[H5414]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] and articles [[H3627]] of bronze [[H5178]] and iron [[H1270]] into the treasury [[H214]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] house. [[H1004]] 
25 And [[H853]] Joshua [[H3091]] spared [[H2421]] Rahab [[H7343]] the prostitute, [[H2181]] with [[H853]] her father’s [[H1]] household [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] who belonged to her, [[H834]] because [[H3588]] she hid [[H2244]] the men [[H4397]] Joshua [[H3091]] had sent [[H7971]] to spy out [[H7270]] Jericho. [[H3405]] So she has lived [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Israelites [[H3478]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
26 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Joshua [[H3091]] invoked this solemn oath: [[H7650]] “Cursed [[H779]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] is the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] rises up [[H6965]] and rebuilds [[H1129]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] Jericho; [[H3405]] at the cost of his firstborn [[H1060]] he will lay its foundations; [[H3245]] at the cost of his youngest [[H6810]] he will set up [[H5324]] its gates. [[H1817]] 
27 So the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and his fame [[H8089]] spread [[H1961]] throughout [[H3605]] the land. [[H776]]
