1 Now Joshua [[H3091]] was old [[H2204]] [and] advanced [[H935]] in years, [[H3117]] and the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “You [[H859]] have become old [[H2204]] [and] advanced [[H935]] in years, [[H3117]] but very much [[H7235]] of the land [[H776]] remains [[H7604]] to be possessed. [[H3423]] 
2 This [[H2063]] is the land [[H776]] that remains: [[H7604]] All [[H3605]] the territory [[H1552]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] and the Geshurites, [[H1651]] 
3 from [[H4480]] the Shihor [[H7883]] east [[H5921]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to [[H5704]] the territory [[H1366]] of Ekron [[H6138]] on the north [[H6828]] (considered [[H2803]] to be Canaanite [territory])— [[H3669]] that of the five [[H2568]] Philistine [[H6430]] rulers [[H5633]] of Gaza, [[H5841]] Ashdod, [[H796]] Ashkelon, [[H832]] Gath, [[H1663]] and Ekron, [[H6139]] as well as the Avvites; [[H5757]] 
4 to the south, [[H8486]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] from Mearah [[H4632]] of [[H834]] the Sidonians [[H6722]] to [[H5704]] Aphek, [[H663]] as far as [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of the Amorites; [[H567]] 
5 the land [[H776]] of the Gebalites; [[H1382]] and all [[H3605]] Lebanon [[H3844]] east [[H4217]] from  Baal-gad [[H1171]] below [[H8478]] Mount [[H2022]] Hermon [[H2768]] to [[H5704]] Lebo-hamath. [[H2574]] 
6 All [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the hill country [[H2022]] from [[H4480]] Lebanon [[H3844]] to [[H5704]] Misrephoth-maim— [[H4956]] all [[H3605]] the Sidonians— [[H6722]] I Myself [[H595]] will drive out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] Be sure to [[H7535]] divide it by lot [[H5307]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] to Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] I have commanded you. [[H6680]] 
7 Now therefore [[H6258]] divide [[H2505]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] to the nine [[H8672]] tribes [[H7626]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh.” [[H4519]] 
8 The other [half of Manasseh], [[H5973]] along with the Reubenites [[H7206]] and Gadites, [[H1425]] had received [[H3947]] the inheritance [[H5159]] Moses [[H4872]] had given [[H5414]] them  beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to the east, [[H4217]] just as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had assigned [[H5414]] to them:  
9 [The area] from Aroer [[H6177]] on [[H5921]] the rim [[H8193]] of the Arnon [[H769]] Valley, [[H5158]] along with the city [[H5892]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the valley, [[H5158]] the whole [[H3605]] plateau [[H4334]] of Medeba [[H4311]] as [[H5704]] far as Dibon, [[H1769]] 
10 and all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites [[H567]] who [[H834]] reigned [[H4427]] in Heshbon, [[H2809]] as far as [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of the Ammonites; [[H1121]] 
11 also Gilead [[H1568]] and the territory [[H1366]] of the Geshurites [[H1651]] and Maacathites, [[H4602]] all [[H3605]] of Mount [[H2022]] Hermon, [[H2768]] and all [[H3605]] Bashan [[H1316]] as far as [[H5704]] Salecah— [[H5548]] 
12 the whole [[H3605]] kingdom [[H4468]] of Og [[H5747]] in Bashan, [[H1316]] who [[H834]] had reigned [[H4427]] in Ashtaroth [[H6252]] and Edrei [[H154]] and had remained [[H7604]] as a remnant [[H3499]] of the Rephaim. [[H7497]] Moses [[H4872]] struck them down [[H5221]] and dispossessed them, [[H3423]] 
13 but the Israelites [[H1121]] did not [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] the Geshurites [[H1651]] or [[H853]] the Maacathites. [[H4602]] So Geshur [[H1650]] and Maacath [[H4601]] dwell [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Israelites [[H3478]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
14 To the tribe [[H7626]] of Levi, [[H3878]] however, [[H7535]] [Moses] had given [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] inheritance. [[H5159]] The offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] are [[H1931]] their inheritance, [[H5159]] as [[H834]] He promised [[H1696]] them.  
15 [This is what] Moses [[H4872]] had given [[H5414]] to the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Reuben: [[H7205]] 
16 The territory [[H1366]] from Aroer [[H6177]] on [[H5921]] the rim [[H8193]] of the Arnon [[H769]] Valley, [[H5158]] along with the city [[H5892]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the valley, [[H5158]] to the whole [[H3605]] plateau [[H4334]] beyond [[H5921]] Medeba, [[H4311]] 
17 with Heshbon [[H2809]] and all [[H3605]] its cities [[H5892]] on the plateau— [[H4334]] Dibon, [[H1769]] Bamoth-baal, [[H1120]] Beth-baal-meon, [[H1010]] 
18 Jahaz, [[H3096]] Kedemoth, [[H6932]] Mephaath, [[H4158]] 
19 Kiriathaim, [[H7156]] Sibmah, [[H7643]] Zereth-shahar [[H6890]] on the hill [[H2022]] in the valley, [[H6010]] 
20 Beth-peor, [[H1047]] the slopes [[H794]] of Pisgah, [[H6449]] and Beth-jeshimoth— [[H1020]] 
21 all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the plateau [[H4334]] and all [[H3605]] the kingdom [[H4468]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] who [[H834]] reigned [[H4427]] in Heshbon [[H2809]] [until] [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] killed [[H5221]] him and the chiefs [[H5387]] of Midian— [[H4080]] Evi, [[H189]] Rekem, [[H7552]] Zur, [[H6698]] Hur, [[H2354]] and Reba— [[H7254]] the princes [[H5257]] of Sihon [[H5511]] who lived [[H3427]] in the land. [[H776]] 
22 The Israelites [[H1121]] also killed [[H853]] the diviner [[H7080]] Balaam [[H1109]] son of Beor [[H1160]] [ along with the others] [[H2026]] they put to the sword. [[H2719]] 
23 And the border [[H1366]] of the Reubenites [[H1121]] was [[H1961]] the bank [[H1366]] of the Jordan. [[H3383]] This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the Reubenites, [[H1121]] including the cities [[H5892]] and villages. [[H2691]] 
24 [This is what] Moses [[H4872]] had given [[H5414]] to the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Gad: [[H1121]] 
25 The territory [[H1366]] of Jazer, [[H3270]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] and half [[H2677]] the land [[H776]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] as far as [[H5704]] Aroer, [[H6177]] near [[H5921]] Rabbah; [[H7237]] 
26 from Heshbon [[H2809]] to [[H5704]] Ramath-mizpeh  and Betonim, [[H993]] and from Mahanaim [[H4266]] to [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of Debir; [[H1688]] 
27 and in the valley, [[H6010]] Beth-haram, [[H1027]] Beth-nimrah, [[H1039]] Succoth, [[H5523]] and Zaphon, [[H6829]] with the rest [[H3499]] of the kingdom [[H4468]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] (the territory [[H1366]] on the east [[H4217]] side [[H5676]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] up [[H5704]] to the edge [[H7097]] of the Sea [[H3220]] of Chinnereth). [[H3672]] 
28 This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the Gadites, [[H1121]] including the cities [[H5892]] and villages. [[H2691]] 
29 [This is what] Moses [[H4872]] had given [[H5414]] to the clans [[H4940]] of the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] that is, [[H1961]] to half [[H2677]] the tribe [[H4294]] of the descendants [[H1121]] of Manasseh: [[H4519]] 
30 The territory [[H1366]] from Mahanaim [[H4266]] through all [[H3605]] Bashan— [[H1316]] all [[H3605]] the kingdom [[H4468]] of Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] including all [[H3605]] the towns [[H2333]] of Jair [[H2971]] that [[H834]] are in Bashan, [[H1316]] sixty [[H8346]] cities, [[H5892]] 
31 half [[H2677]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] also Ashtaroth [[H6252]] and Edrei [[H154]] the royal [[H4468]] cities [[H5892]] of Og [[H5747]] in Bashan. [[H1316]] [All this was] for the clans [[H4940]] of the descendants [[H1121]] of Machir [[H4353]] son [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] that is, half [[H2677]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Machir. [[H4353]] 
32 These [[H428]] {were the portions} Moses [[H4872]] had given them [[H5157]] on the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] east [[H4217]] of Jericho. [[H3405]] 
33 To the tribe [[H7626]] of Levi, [[H3878]] however, [[H4872]] [Moses] had given [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] inheritance. [[H5159]] The LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] is their inheritance, [[H5159]] just as [[H834]] He had promised [[H1696]] them.
