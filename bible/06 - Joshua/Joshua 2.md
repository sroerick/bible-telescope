1 Then Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] secretly [[H2791]] sent [[H7971]] two [[H8147]] spies [[H7270]] from [[H4480]] Acacia Grove, [[H7851]] saying, [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] inspect [[H7200]] the land, [[H776]] especially Jericho.” [[H3405]] So they went [[H1980]] and entered [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of a prostitute [[H2181]] named [[H8034]] Rahab [[H7343]] and stayed [[H7901]] there. [[H8033]] 
2 And it was reported [[H559]] to the king [[H4428]] of Jericho: [[H3405]] “Behold, [[H2009]] some men [[H582]] of Israel [[H3478]] have come [[H935]] here [[H2008]] tonight [[H3915]] to spy out [[H2658]] the land.” [[H776]] 
3 So the king [[H4428]] of Jericho [[H3405]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Rahab [[H7343]] and said, [[H559]] “Bring out [[H3318]] the men [[H376]] who came [[H935]] to [[H413]] you [[H834]] and entered [[H935]] your house, [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] they have come [[H935]] to spy out [[H2658]] the whole [[H3605]] land.” [[H776]] 
4 But the woman [[H802]] had taken [[H3947]] the two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] and hidden them. [[H6845]] So she said, [[H559]] “Yes, [[H3651]] the men [[H376]] did come [[H935]] to me, [[H413]] but I did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] where [[H370]] they had come from. [[H1992]] 
5 At dusk, [[H2822]] when the gate [[H8179]] was [[H1961]] about to close, [[H5462]] the men [[H376]] went out, [[H3318]] and I do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] which way [[H575]] they [[H376]] went. [[H1980]] Pursue [[H7291]] them [[H310]] quickly, [[H4118]] and [[H3588]] you may catch them!” [[H5381]] 
6 (But [Rahab] [[H1931]] had taken them up [[H5927]] to the roof [[H1406]] and hidden them [[H2934]] among the stalks [[H6086]] of flax [[H6593]] that she had laid out [[H6186]] [there].) [[H1406]] 
7 So the [king's] men [[H376]] set out in pursuit [[H7291]] [of the spies] [[H310]] along the road [[H1870]] to [[H5921]] the fords [[H4569]] of the Jordan, [[H3383]] and as [[H834]] soon as they [[H3318]] had gone out, [[H7291]] the gate [[H8179]] was shut. [[H5462]] 
8 Before [[H2962]] [the spies] [[H1992]] lay down for the night, [[H7901]] [Rahab] [[H1931]] went up [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] the roof [[H1406]] 
9 and said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has given [[H5414]] you this land [[H776]] and that [[H3588]] the fear of you [[H367]] has fallen [[H5307]] on us, [[H5921]] so that [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] are melting in fear [[H4127]] of you. [[H6440]] 
10 For [[H3588]] we have heard [[H8085]] how [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] dried up [[H3001]] the waters [[H4325]] of the Red [[H5488]] Sea [[H3220]] before you [[H6440]] when you came out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and what [[H834]] you did [[H6213]] to Sihon [[H5511]] and Og, [[H5747]] the two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites [[H567]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] whom [[H834]] you completely destroyed. [[H2763]] 
11 When we heard this, [[H8085]] our hearts [[H3824]] melted [[H4549]] and everyone’s [[H376]] courage [[H7307]] failed [[H3808]] because of you, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is God [[H430]] in the heavens [[H8064]] above [[H4605]] and on [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] below. [[H8478]] 
12 Now therefore, [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] swear [[H7650]] to me  by the LORD [[H3068]] that you [[H859]] will indeed [[H1571]] show [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] my family [[H1004]] because [[H3588]] I showed [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to you. [[H5973]] Give [[H5414]] me a sure [[H571]] sign [[H226]] 
13 that you will spare the lives [[H2421]] of my father [[H1]] and [[H853]] mother, [[H517]] my brothers [[H251]] and [[H853]] sisters, [[H269]] and all [[H3605]] who belong to them, [[H834]] and that you will deliver [[H5337]] us [[H5315]] from death.” [[H4194]] 
14 “Our lives [[H5315]] for your [[H8478]] lives!” [[H4191]] the men [[H376]] agreed. [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] report [[H5046]] our mission, [[H1697]] we will show [[H6213]] you [[H5973]] kindness [[H2617]] and faithfulness [[H571]] when the LORD [[H3068]] gives [[H5414]] us  the land.” [[H776]] 
15 Then [Rahab] let them down [[H3381]] by a rope [[H2256]] through [[H1157]] the window, [[H2474]] since [[H3588]] the house [[H1004]] where she [[H1931]] lived [[H3427]] was built into the wall [[H7023]] of the city. [[H2346]] 
16 “Go [[H1980]] to the hill country,” [[H2022]] she said, [[H559]] “so that your pursuers [[H7291]] will not [[H6435]] find you. [[H6293]] Hide [[H2247]] yourselves there [[H8033]] for three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] they [[H7291]] have returned; [[H7725]] then [[H310]] go [[H1980]] on your way.” [[H1870]] 
17 The men [[H376]] said [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] “We [[H587]] will not be bound [[H5355]] by this [[H2088]] oath [[H7621]] you made us swear [[H7650]] 
18 unless, [[H2009]] when we [[H587]] enter [[H935]] the land, [[H776]] you have tied [[H7194]] this [[H2088]] scarlet [[H8144]] cord [[H8615]] in the window [[H2474]] through which [[H834]] you let us down, [[H3381]] and unless [[H853]] you have brought [[H622]] your father [[H1]] and [[H853]] mother [[H517]] and [[H853]] brothers [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] your family [[H1004]] into your house. [[H1004]] 
19 If anyone [[H3605]] goes out [[H3318]] the doors [[H1817]] of your house [[H1004]] into the street, [[H2351]] his blood [[H1818]] will be [[H1961]] on his own head, [[H7218]] and we [[H587]] will be innocent. [[H5355]] But if [[H518]] a hand [[H3027]] is laid [[H1961]] on anyone [[H3605]] with you [[H854]] in the house, [[H1004]] his blood [[H1818]] will be on our heads. [[H7218]] 
20 And if [[H518]] you report [[H5046]] our mission, [[H1697]] we will be [[H1961]] released [[H5355]] from the oath [[H7621]] you made us swear.” [[H7650]] 
21 “Let it [[H1931]] be as you say,” [[H1697]] she replied, [[H559]] and sent them away. [[H7971]] And when they had gone, [[H1980]] she tied [[H7194]] the scarlet [[H8144]] cord [[H8615]] in the window. [[H2474]] 
22 So the [spies] went out [[H935]] into the hill country [[H2022]] and stayed [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] their pursuers [[H7291]] had returned [[H7725]] without [[H3808]] finding them, [[H4672]] having searched [[H1245]] all [[H3605]] along the road. [[H1870]] 
23 Then the [two] men [[H376]] started back, [[H7725]] came down [[H3381]] from the hill country [[H2022]] and crossed [the river]. [[H5674]] So they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] and reported [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] that had happened [[H4672]] to them. [[H854]] 
24 “The LORD [[H3068]] has surely [[H3588]] delivered [[H5414]] the entire [[H3605]] land [[H776]] into our hands,” [[H3027]] they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua. [[H3091]] “Indeed, [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] are melting in fear [[H4127]] of us.” [[H6440]]
