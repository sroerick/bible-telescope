1 Then the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] assembled [[H6950]] at Shiloh [[H7887]] and set up [[H7931]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] there. [[H8033]] And though the land [[H776]] was subdued [[H3533]] before them, [[H6440]] 
2 there were still [[H3498]] seven [[H7651]] tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] who [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] yet received [[H2505]] their inheritance. [[H5159]] 
3 So Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “How long [[H5704]] will you [[H859]] neglect [[H7503]] to go out [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] has given [[H5414]] you?  
4 Appoint [[H3051]] three [[H7969]] men [[H376]] from each tribe, [[H7626]] and I will send them out [[H7971]] to survey [[H1980]] the land [[H776]] and map it out, [[H3789]] according to [[H6310]] the inheritance of each. [[H5159]] Then they will return [[H935]] to me [[H413]] 
5 and divide [[H2505]] [the land] [[H853]] into seven [[H7651]] portions. [[H2506]] Judah [[H3063]] shall remain [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] their territory [[H1366]] in the south [[H5045]] and the house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] shall remain [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] their territory [[H1366]] in the north. [[H6828]] 
6 When you [[H859]] have mapped out [[H3789]] the seven [[H7651]] portions [[H2506]] of land [[H776]] and brought [[H935]] it to me, [[H413]] I will cast [[H3384]] lots [[H1486]] for you here [[H6311]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]] 
7 The Levites, [[H3881]] however, [[H3588]] have no [[H369]] portion [[H2506]] among you, [[H7130]] because [[H3588]] their inheritance [[H5159]] is the priesthood [[H3550]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] And Gad, [[H1410]] Reuben, [[H7205]] and half [[H2677]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] have already received [[H3947]] the inheritance [[H5159]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] them  beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to the east. [[H4217]] 
8 As the men [[H582]] got up [[H6965]] to go out, [[H1980]] Joshua [[H3091]] commanded [[H6680]] them [[H1980]] to map out [[H3789]] of the land, [[H776]] saying, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] and survey [[H1980]] the land, [[H776]] map it out, [[H3789]] and return [[H7725]] to me. [[H413]] Then I will cast [[H7993]] lots [[H1486]] for you  here [[H6311]] in Shiloh [[H7887]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
9 So the men [[H582]] departed [[H1980]] and went throughout [[H5674]] the land, [[H776]] mapping it [[H3789]] city by city [[H5892]] into seven [[H7651]] portions. [[H2506]] Then they returned [[H935]] with the document [[H5612]] to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] at [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] in Shiloh. [[H7887]] 
10 And Joshua [[H3091]] cast [[H7993]] lots [[H1486]] for them  in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] at Shiloh, [[H7887]] where [[H8033]] he [[H3091]] distributed [[H2505]] the land [[H776]] to the Israelites [[H1121]] according to their divisions. [[H4256]] 
11 The [first] lot [[H1486]] came up [[H5927]] for the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]] Their allotted [[H1486]] territory [[H1366]] lay [[H3318]] between [[H996]] the [tribes] [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] and [[H996]] Joseph: [[H3130]] 
12 On the north [[H6828]] side [[H6285]] their border [[H1366]] began [[H1961]] at [[H4480]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] went up [[H5927]] past [[H413]] the northern [[H6828]] slope [[H3802]] of Jericho, [[H3405]] headed [[H5927]] west [[H3220]] through the hill country, [[H2022]] and came out [[H1961]] at the wilderness [[H4057]] of Beth-aven. [[H1007]] 
13 From there [[H8033]] the border [[H1366]] crossed over [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the southern [[H5045]] slope [[H3802]] of Luz [[H3870]] (that is, [[H1931]] Bethel) [[H1008]] and went down [[H3381]] to Ataroth-addar [[H5853]] on [[H5921]] the hill [[H2022]] south [[H5045]] of Lower [[H8481]] Beth-horon. [[H1032]] 
14 On the west [[H3220]] side [[H6285]] the border [[H1366]] curved [[H8388]] southward [[H5045]] from [[H4480]] the hill [[H2022]] facing [[H5921]] Beth-horon [[H1032]] on the south [[H5045]] and came out [[H1961]] at [[H413]] Kiriath-baal [[H7154]] (that is, [[H1931]] Kiriath-jearim), [[H7157]] a city [[H5892]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Judah. [[H3063]] This [[H2063]] was the western [[H3220]] side. [[H6285]] 
15 On the south [[H5045]] side [[H6285]] the border [[H1366]] began at the outskirts [[H7097]] of Kiriath-jearim [[H7157]] and extended [[H3318]] westward [[H3220]] to [[H413]] the spring [[H4599]] at the Waters [[H4325]] of Nephtoah. [[H5318]] 
16 Then [it] [[H1366]] went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the foot [[H7097]] of the hill [[H2022]] that [[H834]] faces [[H5921]] the Valley of Hinnom [[H1516]] at the northern [[H6828]] end of the Valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim [[H7497]] and ran down [[H3381]] the Valley of Hinnom [[H1516]] toward [[H413]] the southern [[H5045]] slope [[H3802]] of the Jebusites [[H2983]] and downward [[H3381]] to En-rogel. [[H5883]] 
17 From there it curved [[H8388]] northward [[H6828]] and proceeded [[H3318]] to En-shemesh [[H5885]] and on to [[H413]] Geliloth [[H1553]] facing [[H5227]] the Ascent [[H4608]] of Adummim, [[H131]] and continued down [[H3381]] to the Stone [[H68]] of Bohan [[H932]] son [[H1121]] of Reuben. [[H7205]] 
18 Then it went on [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the northern [[H6828]] slope [[H3802]] of [[H4136]] Beth-arabah [[H6160]] and went down [[H3381]] into the valley. [[H6160]] 
19 The border [[H1366]] continued [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the northern [[H6828]] slope [[H3802]] of Beth-hoglah [[H1031]] and came out [[H1961]] at [[H413]] the northern [[H6828]] bay [[H3956]] of the Salt Sea, [[H3220]] at [[H413]] the mouth [[H5045]] of the Jordan. [[H3383]] This [[H2088]] was the southern [[H5045]] border. [[H1366]] 
20 On the east [[H6924]] side [[H6285]] the border [[H1379]] was the Jordan. [[H3383]] These [[H2063]] [were the] borders [[H1367]] around [[H5439]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H1121]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]] 
21 These were [[H1961]] the cities [[H5892]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Benjamin: [[H1144]] Jericho, [[H3405]] Beth-hoglah, [[H1031]] Emek-keziz, [[H7104]] 
22 Beth-arabah, [[H1026]] Zemaraim, [[H6787]] Bethel, [[H1008]] 
23 Avvim, [[H5761]] Parah, [[H6511]] Ophrah, [[H6084]] 
24 Chephar-ammoni, [[H3726]] Ophni, [[H6078]] and Geba— [[H1387]] twelve [[H8147]] cities, [[H5892]] along with their villages. [[H2691]] 
25 Gibeon, [[H1391]] Ramah, [[H7414]] Beeroth, [[H881]] 
26 Mizpeh, [[H4708]] Chephirah, [[H3716]] Mozah, [[H4681]] 
27 Rekem, [[H7552]] Irpeel, [[H3416]] Taralah, [[H8634]] 
28 Zelah [[H6762]] Haeleph, [[H507]] Jebus [[H2983]] (that is, [[H1931]] Jerusalem), [[H3389]] Gibeah, [[H1394]] and Kiriath-jearim— [[H7157]] fourteen [[H702]] cities, [[H5892]] along with their villages. [[H2691]] This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H1121]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]]
