# Joshua 24
[[Joshua 23|←]] • [[Judges 1|→]]
1 Then Joshua [[H3091]] assembled [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] at Shechem. [[H7927]] He summoned [[H7121]] the elders, [[H2205]] leaders, [[H7218]] judges, [[H8199]] and officers [[H7860]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and they presented [[H3320]] themselves before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]] 
2 And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Long ago [[H5769]] your fathers, [[H1]] including Terah, [[H8646]] the father [[H1]] of Abraham [[H85]] and Nahor, [[H5152]] lived [[H3427]] beyond [[H5676]] the Euphrates [[H5104]] and worshiped [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]] 
3 But I took [[H3947]] your father [[H1]] Abraham [[H85]] from beyond [[H5676]] the Euphrates [[H5104]] and led [[H1980]] him [[H853]] through all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and I multiplied [[H7235]] his descendants. [[H2233]] I gave [[H5414]] him Isaac, [[H3327]] 
4 and to Isaac [[H3327]] I gave [[H5414]] Jacob [[H3290]] and Esau. [[H6215]] I apportioned [[H5414]] to Esau [[H6215]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Seir, [[H8165]] but Jacob [[H3290]] and his sons [[H1121]] went down [[H3381]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] 
5 Then I sent [[H7971]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] and I afflicted [[H5062]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] by what [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] there, [[H7130]] and afterward [[H310]] I brought you out. [[H3318]] 
6 When I brought [[H3318]] your fathers [[H1]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] and you reached [[H935]] the Red Sea, [[H3220]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] pursued [[H7291]] [them] [[H1]] with chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H6571]] as far as the Red Sea. [[H3220]] 
7 So [your fathers] cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He put [[H7760]] darkness [[H3990]] between [[H996]] you and the Egyptians, [[H4713]] over whom [[H5921]] He brought [[H935]] the sea [[H3220]] and engulfed them. [[H3680]] Your very eyes [[H5869]] saw [[H7200]] what [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] to the Egyptians. [[H4714]] Then you lived [[H3427]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] for a long [[H7227]] time. [[H3117]] 
8 Later, I brought [[H935]] you to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Amorites [[H567]] who lived [[H3427]] beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan. [[H3383]] They fought [[H3898]] against you, [[H854]] but I gave [[H5414]] them [[H853]] into your hands, [[H3027]] that you should possess [[H3423]] their land [[H776]] when I destroyed them [[H8045]] before you. [[H6440]] 
9 Then Balak [[H1111]] son [[H1121]] of Zippor, [[H6834]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] set out [[H6965]] to fight [[H3898]] against Israel. [[H3478]] He sent [[H7971]] for Balaam [[H1109]] son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] to curse you, [[H7043]] 
10 but I would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to Balaam. [[H1109]] So he blessed you [[H1288]] again and again, [[H1288]] and I delivered [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from his hand. [[H3027]] 
11 After this, you crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Jericho. [[H3405]] The people [[H1167]] of Jericho [[H3405]] fought against you, [[H3898]] as did the Amorites, [[H567]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Girgashites, [[H1622]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites, [[H2983]] and I delivered [[H5414]] them [[H853]] into your hands. [[H3027]] 
12 I sent [[H7971]] the hornet [[H6880]] ahead of you, [[H6440]] and it drove out [[H1644]] the two [[H8147]] Amorite [[H567]] kings [[H4428]] before you, [[H6440]] [but] not [[H3808]] by your own sword [[H2719]] or bow. [[H7198]] 
13 So I gave [[H5414]] you a land [[H776]] on which [[H834]] you did not [[H3808]] toil [[H3021]] and cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] you did not [[H3808]] build, [[H1129]] and now you live [[H3427]] in them  and eat [[H398]] from vineyards [[H3754]] and olive groves [[H2132]] that [[H834]] you did not [[H3808]] plant.’ [[H5193]] 
14 Now, therefore, [[H6258]] fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] and serve [[H5647]] Him [[H853]] in sincerity [[H8549]] and truth; [[H571]] cast aside [[H5493]] the gods [[H430]] your fathers [[H1]] served [[H5647]] beyond [[H5676]] the Euphrates [[H5104]] and in Egypt, [[H4714]] and serve [[H5647]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 But if [[H518]] it is unpleasing [[H7451]] in your sight [[H5869]] to serve [[H5647]] the LORD, [[H3068]] choose [[H977]] for yourselves  this day [[H3117]] whom [[H4310]] you will serve, [[H5647]] whether the gods [[H430]] your fathers [[H1]] served [[H5647]] beyond [[H5676]] the Euphrates, [[H5104]] or [[H518]] the gods [[H430]] of the Amorites [[H567]] in whose [[H834]] land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are living. [[H3427]] As for me [[H595]] and my house, [[H1004]] we will serve [[H5647]] the LORD! [[H3068]] 
16 The people [[H5971]] replied, [[H6030]] “Far be it from us [[H2486]] to forsake [[H5800]] the LORD [[H3068]] to serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods! [[H430]] 
17 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] brought [[H5927]] us [[H853]] and [[H853]] our fathers [[H1]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery, [[H5650]] and performed [[H6213]] these [[H428]] great [[H1419]] signs [[H226]] before our eyes. [[H5869]] He also protected [[H8104]] us all [[H3605]] throughout our journey [[H1870]] and among all [[H3605]] the nations [[H5971]] through which [[H834]] we traveled. [[H5674]] 
18 And the LORD [[H3068]] drove out [[H1644]] before us [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H5971]] including the Amorites [[H567]] who lived [[H3427]] in the land. [[H776]] We [[H587]] too [[H1571]] will serve [[H5647]] the LORD, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] is our God!” [[H430]] 
19 But Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] “You are not [[H3808]] able [[H3201]] to serve [[H5647]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] is a holy [[H6918]] God; [[H430]] He [[H1931]] is a jealous [[H7072]] God; [[H410]] He will not [[H3808]] forgive [[H5375]] your rebellion [[H6588]] or your sins. [[H2403]] 
20 If [[H3588]] you forsake [[H5800]] the LORD [[H3068]] and serve [[H5647]] foreign [[H5236]] gods, [[H430]] He will turn [[H7725]] and bring disaster [[H7489]] on you  and consume [[H3615]] you, [[H853]] even after [[H310]] He has been good [[H3190]] to you.”  
21 “No!” [[H3808]] replied [[H559]] the people. [[H5971]] “We will serve [[H5647]] the LORD!” [[H3068]] 
22 Then Joshua [[H3091]] told [[H559]] [them], [[H5971]] “You [[H859]] are witnesses [[H5707]] against yourselves  that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] have chosen [[H977]] to serve [[H5647]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] “We are witnesses!” [[H5707]] they said. [[H559]] 
23 “Now, therefore,” [he said], [[H6258]] “get rid of [[H5493]] the foreign [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] among you [[H7130]] and incline [[H5186]] your hearts [[H3824]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel.” [[H3478]] 
24 So the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “We will serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] and obey [[H8085]] His voice.” [[H6963]] 
25 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Joshua [[H3091]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] for the people, [[H5971]] and there at Shechem [[H7927]] he established [[H7760]] for them  a statute [[H2706]] and ordinance. [[H4941]] 
26 Joshua [[H3091]] recorded [[H3789]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of God. [[H430]] Then he took [[H3947]] a large [[H1419]] stone [[H68]] and set it up [[H6965]] there [[H8033]] under [[H8478]] the oak [[H427]] that [was] [[H834]] near the sanctuary [[H4720]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
27 And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] “You see [[H2009]] this [[H2063]] stone. [[H68]] It will be [[H1961]] a witness [[H5713]] against us,  for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] has heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H561]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken [[H1696]] to us, [[H5973]] and it will be [[H1961]] a witness against you [[H5713]] if you ever [[H6435]] deny [[H3584]] your God. [[H430]] 
28 Then Joshua [[H3091]] sent the people [[H5971]] away, [[H7971]] each [[H376]] to his own inheritance. [[H5159]] 
29 Some time later, [[H310]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] died [[H4191]] at the age [[H1121]] of 110. [[H3967]] 
30 And they buried [[H6912]] him [[H853]] in the land [[H1366]] of his inheritance, [[H5159]] at Timnath-serah [[H8556]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] north [[H6828]] of Mount [[H2022]] Gaash. [[H1608]] 
31 Israel [[H3478]] had served [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] through all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Joshua [[H3091]] [and] [[H3605]] of the elders [[H2205]] who [[H834]] outlived [[H748]] [him] [[H3091]] and [[H834]] had experienced [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] the LORD [[H3068]] had done [[H6213]] for Israel. [[H3478]] 
32 Also, [[H853]] the bones [[H6106]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] which [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had brought up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] were buried [[H6912]] at Shechem [[H7927]] in the plot [[H2513]] of land [[H7704]] that [[H834]] Jacob [[H3290]] had purchased [[H7069]] from the sons [[H1121]] of Hamor, [[H2544]] Shechem’s [[H7927]] father, [[H1]] for a hundred [[H3967]] pieces of silver. [[H7192]] So it became [[H1961]] an inheritance [[H5159]] for Joseph’s [[H3130]] descendants. [[H1121]] 
33 And Eleazar [[H499]] son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] died, [[H4191]] and they buried [[H6912]] him at Gibeah, [[H1389]] which [[H834]] had been given [[H5414]] to his son [[H1121]] Phinehas [[H6372]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim. [[H669]]
