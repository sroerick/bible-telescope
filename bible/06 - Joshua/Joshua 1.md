# Joshua 1
[[Deuteronomy 34|←]] • [[Joshua 2|→]]
1 Now [[H1961]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of His [[H3068]] servant [[H5650]] Moses, [[H4872]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] Moses' [[H4872]] assistant, [[H8334]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Moses [[H4872]] My servant [[H5650]] is dead. [[H4191]] Now therefore [[H6258]] arise, [[H6965]] you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] these people, [[H5971]] [and] cross over [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] I [[H595]] am giving [[H5414]] to  the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
3 I have given you [[H5414]] every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the sole [[H3709]] of your foot [[H7272]] will tread, [[H1869]] just as [[H834]] I promised [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
4 Your territory [[H1366]] shall extend [[H1961]] from the wilderness [[H4057]] and Lebanon [[H3844]] to [[H5704]] the great [[H1419]] River [[H5104]] Euphrates— [[H6578]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of the Hittites— [[H2850]] and west [[H3996]] as far as [[H5704]] the Great [[H1419]] Sea. [[H3220]] 
5 No [[H3808]] one [[H376]] shall stand [[H3320]] against you [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of your life. [[H2416]] As [[H834]] I was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Moses, [[H4872]] so I will be [[H1961]] with you; [[H5973]] I will never [[H3808]] leave you [[H7503]] [or] [[H3808]] forsake you. [[H5800]] 
6 Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous, [[H553]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] shall give these people the inheritance [[H5157]] of the land [[H776]] I swore [[H7650]] to their fathers [[H1]] I would give [[H5414]] them.  
7 Above all, [[H7535]] be strong [[H2388]] and very [[H3966]] courageous. [[H553]] Be careful [[H8104]] to observe [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the law [[H8451]] My servant [[H5650]] Moses [[H4872]] commanded you. [[H6680]] Do not [[H408]] turn [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] it to the right [[H3225]] or to the left, [[H8040]] so that [[H4616]] you may prosper [[H7919]] wherever [[H3605]] you go. [[H1980]] 
8 This [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] must not [[H3808]] depart [[H4185]] from your mouth; [[H6310]] you are to recite [[H1897]] it day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] so that [[H4616]] you may carefully [[H8104]] observe [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] written in it. [[H3789]] For [[H3588]] then [[H227]] you will prosper [[H6743]] and succeed [[H7919]] in all you do. [[H1870]] 
9 Have I not [[H3808]] commanded you [[H6680]] to be strong [[H2388]] and courageous? [[H553]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H6206]] or discouraged, [[H2865]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is with [[H5973]] you wherever [[H3605]] you go.” [[H1980]] 
10 Then Joshua [[H3091]] commanded [[H6680]] the officers [[H7860]] of the people: [[H5971]] 
11 “Go [[H5674]] through [[H7130]] the camp [[H4264]] and tell [[H6680]] the people, [[H5971]] ‘Prepare [[H3559]] your  provisions, [[H6720]] for [[H3588]] within [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] you [[H859]] will cross [[H5674]] the [[H2088]] Jordan [[H3383]] to go in [[H935]] and take possession of [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you  for your own. [[H3423]] 
12 But to the Reubenites, [[H7206]] the Gadites, [[H1425]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] Joshua [[H3091]] said, [[H559]] 
13 “Remember [[H2142]] what [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] you [[H853]] when he said, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will give you rest, [[H5117]] and He will give [[H5414]] you this [[H2063]] land.’ [[H776]] 
14 Your wives, [[H802]] your young children, [[H2945]] and your livestock [[H4735]] may remain [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H5414]] you  on this side [[H5676]] of the Jordan. [[H3383]] But your fighting men [[H1368]] must be armed for battle [[H2571]] to cross over [[H5674]] ahead of [[H6440]] your brothers [[H251]] and help them, [[H5826]] 
15 until [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] gives [them] rest [[H5117]] as He has done for you  and [your brothers] [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving them. [[H5414]] Then you may return [[H7725]] to the land [[H776]] of your inheritance [[H3425]] and take possession of [[H3423]] that which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] you on the east [[H4217]] side [[H5676]] of the Jordan. [[H3383]] 
16 So they answered [[H6030]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Everything [[H3605]] you have commanded [[H6680]] us we will do, [[H6213]] and everywhere [[H413]] you send [[H7971]] us we will go. [[H1980]] 
17 Just as [[H834]] we obeyed [[H8085]] Moses [[H4872]] in all things, [[H3605]] so we will obey you. [[H8085]] And may the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] be [[H1961]] with you, [[H5973]] as [[H834]] He was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
18 Anyone [[H3605]] who [[H834]] rebels [[H4784]] against your order [[H6310]] and does not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] your words, [[H1697]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] you command him, [[H6680]] will be put to death. [[H4191]] Above all, [[H7535]] be strong [[H2388]] and courageous!” [[H553]]
