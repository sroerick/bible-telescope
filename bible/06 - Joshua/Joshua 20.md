# Joshua 20
[[Joshua 19|←]] • [[Joshua 21|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] 
2 “Tell [[H1696]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to designate [[H5414]] the cities [[H5892]] of refuge, [[H4733]] as [[H834]] I instructed [[H1696]] you through [[H3027]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
3 so that anyone [[H7523]] who kills [[H5221]] another [[H5315]] unintentionally [[H7684]] or accidentally [[H1097]] may flee [[H5127]] there. [[H8033]] These will be [[H1961]] your refuge [[H4733]] from the avenger [[H1350]] of blood. [[H1818]] 
4 When someone flees [[H5127]] to [[H413]] one [[H259]] of these [[H428]] cities, [[H5892]] stands [[H5975]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the city, [[H5892]] and states [[H1696]] his case [[H1697]] before [its] elders, [[H2205]] they are to bring [[H622]] him into the city [[H5892]] and give [[H5414]] him a place [[H4725]] to live [[H3427]] among them. [[H5973]] 
5 Now if [[H3588]] the avenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] pursues him, [[H7291]] they must not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5462]] the manslayer [[H7523]] into his hands, [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] [that man] killed [[H5221]] his neighbor [[H7453]] accidentally [[H1097]] without [[H3808]] prior [[H8032]] malice. [[H8130]] 
6 He is to stay [[H3427]] in that [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] until [[H5704]] he stands [[H5975]] trial [[H4941]] before [[H6440]] the assembly [[H5712]] and until [[H5704]] the death [[H4194]] of the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] serving [[H1961]] at that [[H1992]] time. [[H3117]] Then [[H227]] the manslayer [[H7523]] may return [[H7725]] to his own home [[H1004]] in the city [[H5892]] from which [[H834]] he fled. [[H5127]] 
7 So they set apart [[H6942]] Kedesh [[H6943]] in Galilee [[H1551]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] Shechem [[H7927]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and Kiriath-arba [[H7153]] (that is, [[H1931]] Hebron) [[H2275]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
8 And beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] east [[H4217]] of Jericho, [[H3405]] they designated [[H5414]] Bezer [[H1221]] on the wilderness [[H4057]] plateau [[H4334]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] Ramoth [[H7216]] in Gilead [[H1568]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Gad, [[H1410]] and Golan [[H1474]] in Bashan [[H1316]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Manasseh. [[H4519]] 
9 These [[H428]] are [[H1961]] the cities [[H5892]] appointed [[H4152]] for all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and foreigners [[H1616]] among them, [[H8432]] so that anyone [[H3605]] who kills [[H5221]] a person [[H5315]] unintentionally [[H7684]] may flee [[H5127]] there [[H8033]] and not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] by the hand [[H3027]] of the avenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] prior [[H5704]] to standing [trial] [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the assembly.
