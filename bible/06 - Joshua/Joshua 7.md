1 The Israelites, [[H1121]] however, [[H3478]] acted [[H4603]] unfaithfully [[H4604]] regarding the devoted things. [[H2764]] Achan [[H5912]] son [[H1121]] of Carmi, [[H3756]] the son [[H1121]] of Zabdi, [[H2067]] the son [[H1121]] of Zerah, [[H2226]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah, [[H3063]] took [[H3947]] some of what was set apart. [[H4480]] So the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
2 Meanwhile, Joshua [[H3091]] sent [[H7971]] men [[H376]] from Jericho [[H3405]] to Ai, [[H5857]] which [[H834]] is near [[H5973]] Beth-aven, [[H1007]] east [[H6924]] of Bethel, [[H1008]] and told them, [[H559]] “Go up [[H5927]] and spy out [[H7270]] the land.” [[H776]] So the men [[H376]] went up [[H5927]] and spied out [[H7270]] Ai. [[H5857]] 
3 On returning [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] they reported, [[H559]] “There is no need [[H408]] to send all [[H3605]] the people; [[H5971]] two [[H505]] or [[H176]] three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] men [are enough] [[H376]] to go up [[H5927]] and attack [[H5221]] Ai. [[H5857]] Since [[H3588]] the people of Ai [[H1992]] are so few, [[H4592]] you need not [[H408]] wear out [[H3021]] all [[H3605]] our people [[H5971]] there. [[H8033]] 
4 So about three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] went up, [[H5927]] but they were put to flight [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] the men [[H376]] of Ai. [[H5857]] 
5 And the men [[H376]] of Ai [[H5857]] struck down [[H5221]] about thirty-six of them [[H7970]] and chased [[H7291]] them from [[H6440]] the gate [[H8179]] as far as [[H5704]] the quarries, [[H7671]] striking them down [[H5221]] on the slopes. [[H4174]] So the hearts [[H3824]] of the people [[H5971]] melted [[H4549]] and became [[H1961]] like water. [[H4325]] 
6 Then Joshua [[H3091]] tore [[H7167]] his clothes [[H8071]] and fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H6440]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] as did the elders [[H2205]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and they all sprinkled [[H5927]] dust [[H6083]] on [[H5921]] their heads. [[H7218]] 
7 “O, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD,” [[H3069]] Joshua [[H3091]] said, [[H559]] “why [[H4100]] did You ever bring these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] across [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to hand us over to [[H5414]] the Amorites [[H567]] to be destroyed? [[H6]] If only [[H3863]] we had been content [[H2974]] to stay [[H3427]] on the other side [[H5676]] of the Jordan! [[H3383]] 
8 O [[H994]] Lord, [[H136]] what [[H4100]] can I say, [[H559]] now that [[H310]] Israel [[H3478]] has turned [[H2015]] its back [[H6203]] and run from [[H6440]] its enemies? [[H341]] 
9 When the Canaanites [[H3669]] and all [[H3605]] who live [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] hear about this, [[H8085]] they will surround [[H5437]] us [[H5921]] and wipe out [[H3772]] our name [[H8034]] from [[H4480]] the earth. [[H776]] Then what [[H4100]] will You do [[H6213]] for Your great [[H1419]] name?” [[H8034]] 
10 But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Stand up! [[H6965]] Why [[H4100]] have you [[H859]] fallen [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] your face? [[H6440]] 
11 Israel [[H3478]] has sinned; [[H2398]] they have transgressed [[H5674]] My covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] them, [[H853]] and they [[H1571]] have taken [[H3947]] some of [[H4480]] what was devoted. [[H2764]] Indeed, [[H1571]] they have stolen [[H1589]] and [[H1571]] lied about it, [[H3584]] and [[H1571]] they have put [these things] [[H7760]] with their own possessions. [[H3627]] 
12 This is why the Israelites [[H1121]] cannot [[H3808]] stand [[H6965]] against [[H6440]] their enemies. [[H341]] They will turn [[H6437]] their backs [[H6203]] and run from [[H6440]] their enemies, [[H341]] because [[H3588]] they have been [[H1961]] set apart for destruction. [[H2764]] I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] you unless [[H518]] you remove [[H8045]] from among you [[H7130]] whatever is devoted to destruction. [[H2764]] 
13 Get up [[H6965]] and consecrate [[H6942]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Consecrate yourselves [[H6942]] for tomorrow, [[H4279]] for [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] That which is devoted [[H2764]] is among you, [[H7130]] O Israel. [[H3478]] You cannot [[H3808]] stand [[H6965]] against [[H6440]] your enemies [[H341]] until [[H5704]] you remove [[H5493]] [it]. [[H2764]] 
14 In the morning [[H1242]] you must present yourselves [[H7126]] tribe by tribe. [[H7626]] The tribe [[H7626]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] selects [[H3920]] shall come forward [[H7126]] clan by clan, [[H4940]] and the clan [[H4940]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] selects [[H3920]] shall come forward [[H7126]] family by family, [[H1004]] and the family [[H1004]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] selects [[H3920]] shall come forward [[H7126]] man by man. [[H1397]] 
15 The one who is caught [[H3920]] with the devoted things [[H2764]] must be burned, [[H8313]] along with all [[H853]] that belongs to him, [[H3605]] because [[H3588]] he has transgressed [[H5674]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [and] [[H3588]] committed [[H6213]] an outrage [[H5039]] in Israel.” [[H3478]] 
16 So Joshua [[H3091]] arose early [[H7925]] the next morning [[H1242]] and had Israel [[H3478]] come forward [[H7126]] tribe by tribe, [[H7626]] and the tribe [[H7626]] of Judah [[H3063]] was selected. [[H3920]] 
17 He had the clans [[H4940]] of Judah [[H3063]] come forward, [[H7126]] and the clan [[H4940]] of the Zerahites [[H2227]] was selected. [[H3920]] He had the Zerahite [[H2227]] clan [[H4940]] come forward [[H7126]] by families, [[H1397]] and Zabdi [[H2067]] was selected. [[H3920]] 
18 And he had Zabdi’s family [[H1004]] come forward [[H7126]] man by man, [[H1397]] and Achan [[H5912]] son [[H1121]] of Carmi, [[H3756]] the son [[H1121]] of Zabdi, [[H2067]] the son [[H1121]] of Zerah, [[H2226]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah, [[H3063]] was selected. [[H3920]] 
19 So Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Achan, [[H5912]] “My son, [[H1121]] give [[H7760]] glory [[H3519]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and make [[H5414]] a confession [[H8426]] to Him.  I urge you [[H4994]] to tell [[H5046]] me  what [[H4100]] you have done; [[H6213]] do not [[H408]] hide [it] [[H3582]] from me.” [[H4480]] 
20 “It is true,” [[H546]] Achan [[H5912]] replied, [[H6030]] “I [[H595]] have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] This [[H2063]] is what I did: [[H6213]] 
21 When I saw [[H7200]] among the spoils [[H7998]] a [[H259]] beautiful [[H2896]] cloak [[H155]] from Shinar, [[H8152]] two hundred [[H3967]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver, [[H3701]] and a [[H259]] bar [[H3956]] of gold [[H2091]] weighing [[H4948]] fifty [[H2572]] shekels, [[H8255]] I coveted [[H2530]] them and took them. [[H3947]] They are [[H2009]] hidden [[H2934]] in the ground [[H776]] inside [[H8432]] my tent, [[H168]] with the silver [[H3701]] underneath. [[H8478]] 
22 So Joshua [[H3091]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] who ran [[H7323]] to the tent, [[H168]] and there was [the cloak], [[H2009]] hidden [[H2934]] in his tent, [[H168]] with the silver [[H3701]] underneath. [[H8478]] 
23 They took the things [[H3947]] from inside [[H8432]] the tent, [[H168]] brought [[H935]] them to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] and spread them out [[H3332]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
24 Then Joshua, [[H3091]] together with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] took [[H3947]] Achan [[H5912]] son [[H1121]] of Zerah, [[H2226]] the silver, [[H3701]] the cloak, [[H155]] and the bar [[H3956]] of gold, [[H2091]] his sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] his oxen, [[H7794]] donkeys, [[H2543]] and sheep, [[H6629]] his tent, [[H168]] and everything [else] [[H3605]] he owned, [[H834]] and brought them [[H5927]] to the Valley [[H6010]] of Achor. [[H5911]] 
25 “Why [[H4100]] have you brought this trouble upon us?” [[H5916]] said [[H559]] Joshua. [[H3091]] “Today [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] will bring trouble upon you!” [[H5916]] And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] stoned him to death. [[H7275]] Then they stoned [the others] [[H5619]] and burned their bodies. [[H8313]] 
26 And they heaped [[H6965]] over [Achan] [[H5921]] a large [[H1419]] pile [[H1530]] of rocks [[H68]] that remains to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] So the LORD [[H3068]] turned [[H7725]] from His burning anger. [[H2740]] Therefore [[H5921]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] is called [[H7121]] the Valley [[H6010]] of Achor [[H5911]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]
