# Joshua 23
[[Joshua 22|←]] • [[Joshua 24|→]]
1 A long [[H7227]] time [[H3117]] after [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] had given Israel [[H3478]] rest [[H5117]] from all [[H3605]] the enemies [[H341]] around them, [[H5439]] when Joshua [[H3091]] was old [[H2205]] [and] advanced [[H935]] in years, [[H3117]] 
2 [he] [[H3091]] summoned [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] including its elders, [[H2205]] leaders, [[H7218]] judges, [[H8199]] and officers. [[H7860]] “I [[H589]] am old [[H2204]] [and] advanced [[H935]] in years,” [[H3117]] he said, [[H559]] 
3 “and you [[H859]] have seen [[H7200]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has done [[H6213]] to all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] for your sake, [[H6440]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] was the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] who fought [[H3898]] for you.  
4 See, [[H7200]] I have allotted [[H5307]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] to your tribes [[H7626]] these [[H428]] remaining [[H7604]] nations, [[H1471]] including all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] I have already cut off, [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] the Jordan [[H3383]] westward [[H3996]] to the Great Sea. [[H3220]] 
5 The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will push them [[H1920]] out of your way [[H6440]] and drive them out [[H3423]] before you, [[H853]] so that you can take possession of [[H3423]] their land, [[H776]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] promised you. [[H1696]] 
6 Be very [[H3966]] strong, then, [[H2388]] so that you can keep [[H8104]] and obey [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] not [[H1115]] turning aside [[H5493]] from it [[H4480]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left. [[H8040]] 
7 So you are not [[H1115]] to associate [[H935]] with these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] remaining [[H7604]] among you. [[H854]] Do not [[H3808]] call on [[H2142]] the names [[H8034]] of their gods [[H430]] or swear by them, [[H7650]] and you must not [[H3808]] serve them [[H5647]] [or] [[H3808]] bow down [[H7812]] to them.  
8 Instead, [[H3588]] you shall hold fast [[H1692]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] you have done [[H6213]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
9 The LORD [[H3068]] has driven out [[H3423]] great [[H1419]] and powerful [[H6099]] nations [[H1471]] before you, [[H6440]] and to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] can stand [[H5975]] against you. [[H6440]] 
10 One [[H259]] of you [[H4480]] can put [[H7291]] a thousand {to flight}, [[H505]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] fights for you, [[H3898]] just as [[H834]] He promised. [[H1696]] 
11 Therefore watch [[H8104]] yourselves [[H5315]] carefully, [[H3966]] that you love [[H157]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
12 For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you turn away [[H7725]] and cling [[H1692]] to the rest [[H3499]] of these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] that remain [[H7604]] among you, [[H854]] and if you intermarry [[H2859]] and associate [[H935]] with them, [[H1992]] 
13 know for sure [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] drive out [[H3423]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] before you. [[H6440]] Instead, they will become [[H1961]] for you  a snare [[H6341]] and a trap, [[H4170]] a scourge [[H7850]] for your sides [[H6654]] and thorns [[H6796]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] until [[H5704]] you perish [[H6]] from [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land [[H127]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has given [[H5414]] you.  
14 Now behold, [[H2009]] today [[H3117]] I [[H595]] am going [[H1980]] the way [[H1870]] of all [[H3605]] the earth, [[H776]] and you know [[H3045]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] [and] [[H3605]] soul [[H5315]] that [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] the good [[H2896]] promises [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] made [[H1696]] to you [[H5921]] has failed. [[H5307]] Everything [[H3605]] was fulfilled [[H935]] for you;  not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] promise [[H1697]] has failed. [[H5307]] 
15 But just as [[H834]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] thing [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] promised you [[H1696]] has come to pass, [[H935]] likewise [[H3651]] the LORD [[H3068]] will bring [[H935]] upon you [[H3605]] the calamity He has threatened, [[H7451]] until [[H5704]] He has destroyed [[H8045]] you [[H853]] from [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land [[H127]] [He] [[H3068]] has given [[H5414]] you.  
16 If you transgress [[H5674]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] He commanded you, [[H6680]] and go [[H1980]] and serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] and bow down to them, [[H7812]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] will burn against you, [[H2734]] and you will quickly [[H4120]] perish [[H6]] from [[H5921]] this good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] He has given [[H5414]] you.
