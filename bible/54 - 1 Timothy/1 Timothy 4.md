1 Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] expressly [[G4490]] states [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] later [[G5306]] times [[G2540]] some [[G5100]] will abandon [[G868]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] to follow [[G4337]] deceitful [[G4108]] spirits [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] [the] teachings [[G1319]] of demons, [[G1140]] 
2 influenced by [[G1722]] [the] hypocrisy [[G5272]] of liars, [[G5573]] [whose] [[G2398]] consciences [[G4893]] are seared with a hot iron. [[G2743]] 
3 They will prohibit [[G2967]] marriage [[G1060]] [and require] abstinence [[G568]] from certain foods [[G1033]] that [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has created [[G2936]] to [[G1519]] be received [[G3336]] with [[G3326]] thanksgiving [[G2169]] by those who [[G3588]] believe [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] know [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] 
4 For [[G3754]] every [[G3956]] creation [[G2938]] of God [[G2316]] [is] good, [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] nothing [[G3762]] that is received [[G2983]] with [[G3326]] thanksgiving [[G2169]] should be rejected, [[G579]] 
5 because [[G1063]] it is sanctified [[G37]] by [[G1223]] [the] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] prayer. [[G1783]] 
6 By pointing out [[G5294]] these things [[G3778]] to the [[G3588]] brothers, [[G80]] you will be [[G1510]] a good [[G2570]] servant [[G1249]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] nourished [[G1789]] by the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] sound [[G2570]] instruction [[G1319]] you have followed. [[G3877]] 
7 But [[G1161]] reject [[G3868]] irreverent [[G952]] and [[G2532]] silly [[G1126]] myths. [[G3454]] Instead, [[G1161]] train [[G1128]] yourself [[G4572]] for [[G4314]] godliness. [[G2150]] 
8 For [[G1063]] physical [[G4984]] exercise [[G1129]] is [[G1510]] of [[G4314]] limited [[G3641]] value, [[G5624]] but [[G1161]] godliness [[G2150]] is [[G1510]] valuable [[G5624]] in [[G4314]] every [way], [[G3956]] holding [[G2192]] promise [[G1860]] for the [[G3588]] present [[G3568]] life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] for the [one] [[G3588]] to come. [[G3195]] 
9 [This is] a trustworthy [[G4103]] saying, [[G3056]] worthy [[G514]] of full [[G3956]] acceptance. [[G594]] 
10 To [[G1519]] this [end] [[G3778]] we labor [[G2872]] and [[G2532]] strive, [[G75]] because [[G3754]] we have set our hope [[G1679]] on [[G1909]] [the] living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] Savior [[G4990]] of all [[G3956]] men, [[G444]] [and] especially [[G3122]] of those who believe. [[G4103]] 
11 Command [[G3853]] and [[G2532]] teach [[G1321]] these things. [[G3778]] 
12 {Let} no one [[G3367]] despise [[G2706]] your [[G4771]] youth, [[G3503]] but [[G235]] set [[G1096]] an example [[G5179]] for the [[G3588]] believers [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] speech, [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] conduct, [[G391]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] in [[G1722]] faith, [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] purity. [[G47]] 
13 Until [[G2193]] I come, [[G2064]] devote yourself [[G4337]] to the [[G3588]] public reading of Scripture, [[G320]] to [[G3588]] exhortation, [[G3874]] [and] to [[G3588]] teaching. [[G1319]] 
14 {Do} not [[G3361]] neglect [[G272]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G5486]] [that is] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] which [[G3739]] was given [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] through [[G1223]] [the] prophecy spoken [[G4394]] [over you] at [[G3326]] [the] laying on [[G1936]] of the [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] of the [[G3588]] elders. [[G4244]] 
15 Be diligent [[G3191]] in these matters [[G3778]] [and] absorbed [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] them, [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] your [[G4771]] progress [[G4297]] will be [[G1510]] evident [[G5318]] to all. [[G3956]] 
16 Pay close attention [[G1907]] to your [life] [[G4572]] and [[G2532]] to [your] [[G3588]] teaching. [[G1319]] Persevere [[G1961]] in these things, [[G846]] for [[G1063]] by so doing [[G4160]] you will save [[G4982]] both [[G2532]] yourself [[G4572]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] hear [[G191]] you. [[G4771]]
