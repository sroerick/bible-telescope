1 {Do} not [[G3361]] rebuke [[G1969]] an older man, [[G4245]] but [[G235]] appeal to [him] [[G3870]] as to [[G5613]] a father. [[G3962]] [Treat] younger [men] [[G3501]] as [[G5613]] brothers, [[G80]] 
2 older [women] [[G4245]] as [[G5613]] mothers, [[G3384]] [and] younger [women] [[G3501]] as [[G5613]] sisters, [[G79]] with [[G1722]] absolute [[G3956]] purity. [[G47]] 
3 Support [[G5091]] [the] widows [[G5503]] who [are] [[G3588]] truly [[G3689]] [in need]. [[G5503]] 
4 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] a [[G5100]] widow [[G5503]] has [[G2192]] children [[G5043]] or [[G2228]] grandchildren, [[G1549]] they must first learn [[G3129]] to show godliness [[G2151]] to [their] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] family [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] repay [[G591]] [their] [[G3588]] parents, [[G4269]] for [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] pleasing [[G587]] in the sight of [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]] 
5 [The widow] who [is] [[G3588]] truly [[G3689]] [in need] [[G5503]] and [[G2532]] left all alone [[G3443]] puts [her] hope [[G1679]] in [[G1909]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] continues [[G4357]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] in [her] [[G3588]] petitions [[G1162]] and [[G2532]] prayers. [[G4335]] 
6 But [[G1161]] she who [[G3588]] lives for pleasure [[G4684]] is dead [[G2348]] [even while she] is still alive. [[G2198]] 
7 Give these instructions [to the believers], [[G3853]] so that [[G2443]] they will be [[G1510]] above reproach. [[G423]] 
8 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] does not provide for [[G4306]] [his] [[G3588]] own, [[G2398]] and [[G2532]] especially [his own] [[G3122]] household, [[G3609]] he has denied [[G720]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] is [[G1510]] worse than [[G5501]] an unbeliever. [[G571]] 
9 A widow [[G5503]] should be enrolled [[G2639]] if she is [[G1096]] [at least] [[G1640]] sixty [[G1835]] years [old], [[G2094]] [the] wife [[G1135]] of one [[G1520]] man, [[G435]] 
10 [and] well known [[G3140]] for [[G1722]] good [[G2570]] deeds [[G2041]] [such as] [[G1487]] bringing up children, [[G5044]] entertaining strangers, [[G3580]] washing [[G3538]] [the] feet [[G4228]] of the saints, [[G40]] imparting relief [[G1884]] to the afflicted, [[G2346]] [and] [[G1487]] devoting herself to [[G1872]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work. [[G2041]] 
11 But [[G1161]] refuse [to enroll] [[G3868]] younger [[G3501]] widows. [[G5503]] For [[G1063]] when [[G3752]] their passions draw them away [[G2691]] from Christ, [[G5547]] they will want [[G2309]] to marry, [[G1060]] 
12 [and thus] will incur [[G2192]] judgment [[G2917]] because [[G3754]] they are setting aside [[G114]] [their] [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] faith. [[G4102]] 
13 At the same time [[G260]] they will also learn [[G3129]] [to be] idle, [[G692]] going from [[G4022]] house to house [[G3614]] and {being} [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] idle, [[G692]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] gossips [[G5397]] and [[G2532]] busybodies, [[G4021]] speaking of [[G2980]] things [[G3588]] they should [[G1163]] not [ mention ]. [[G3361]] 
14 So [[G3767]] I advise [[G1014]] [the] younger [widows] [[G3501]] to marry, [[G1060]] have children, [[G5041]] [and] manage their households, [[G3616]] so they will not give [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] adversary [[G480]] an occasion [[G874]] for [[G5484]] slander. [[G3059]] 
15 For [[G1063]] some [[G5100]] have already turned aside [[G1624]] to follow [[G3694]] Satan. [[G4567]] 
16 If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] believing [woman] [[G4103]] has [[G2192]] [dependent] widows, [[G5503]] she must assist [[G1884]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] {allow} the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] to be burdened, [[G916]] so that [[G2443]] it can help [[G1884]] the [[G3588]] widows [who are] [[G5503]] truly [ in need ]. [[G3689]] 
17 Elders [[G4245]] who lead [[G4291]] effectively [[G2573]] are worthy [[G515]] of double [[G1362]] honor, [[G5092]] especially [[G3122]] those who [[G3588]] work hard [[G2872]] at [[G1722]] preaching [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] teaching. [[G1319]] 
18 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] says, [[G3004]] “Do not muzzle [[G5392]] an ox [[G1016]] while it is treading out the grain,” [[G248]] and, [[G2532]] “The [[G3588]] worker [[G2040]] [is] worthy [[G514]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] wages.” [[G3408]] 
19 {Do} not [[G3361]] entertain [[G3858]] an accusation [[G2724]] against [[G2596]] an elder, [[G4245]] except [[G1622]] on [the testimony of] [[G1909]] two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] witnesses. [[G3144]] 
20 But [[G1161]] those who [[G3588]] persist in sin [[G264]] should be rebuked [[G1651]] in front of [[G1799]] everyone, [[G3956]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] others [[G3062]] will [[G2192]] stand in fear [of sin]. [[G5401]] 
21 I solemnly charge [you] [[G1263]] before [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elect [[G1588]] angels [[G32]] to [[G2443]] maintain [[G5442]] these [principles] [[G3778]] without [[G5565]] bias, [[G4299]] [and] to do [[G4160]] nothing [[G3367]] out of [[G2596]] partiality. [[G4346]] 
22 Do not be too quick [[G5030]] in the laying on [[G2007]] of hands [[G5495]] [and thereby] [[G3366]] share [[G2841]] in [the] sins [[G266]] of others. [[G245]] Keep [[G5083]] yourself [[G4572]] pure. [[G53]] 
23 Stop drinking [only] water [[G5202]] [and] use [[G5530]] a little [[G3641]] wine [[G3631]] instead, [[G235]] because of [[G1223]] [your] [[G3588]] stomach [[G4751]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] frequent [[G4437]] ailments. [[G769]] 
24 The [[G3588]] sins [[G266]] of some [[G5100]] men [[G444]] are [[G1510]] obvious, [[G4271]] going ahead of [them] [[G4254]] to [[G1519]] judgment; [[G2920]] but [[G1161]] [the sins] of others [[G5100]] do [not] surface until later. [[G1872]] 
25 In the same way, [[G5615]] good [[G2570]] deeds [[G2041]] [are] obvious, [[G4271]] and even [[G2532]] the [ones that] [[G3588]] are [[G2192]] [inconspicuous] [[G247]] cannot [[G1410]] remain hidden. [[G2928]]
