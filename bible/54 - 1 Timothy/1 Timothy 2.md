1 First [[G4412]] of all, [[G3956]] then, [[G3767]] I urge that [[G3870]] petitions, [[G1162]] prayers, [[G4335]] intercessions, [[G1783]] [and] thanksgiving [[G2169]] be offered [[G4160]] on behalf of [[G5228]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] 
2 for [[G5228]] kings [[G935]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] those [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] authority, [[G5247]] so that [[G2443]] we may lead [[G1236]] tranquil [[G2263]] and [[G2532]] quiet [[G2272]] lives [[G979]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] godliness [[G2150]] and [[G2532]] dignity. [[G4587]] 
3 This [[G3778]] [is] good [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] pleasing [[G587]] in the sight of [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Savior, [[G4990]] 
4 who [[G3739]] desires [[G2309]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] to be saved [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] [the] knowledge [[G1922]] of [the] truth. [[G225]] 
5 For [[G1063]] [there is] one [[G1520]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] mediator [[G3316]] between God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] men, [[G444]] [the] man [[G444]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] 
6 who [[G3588]] gave [[G1325]] Himself [[G1438]] [as] a ransom [[G487]] for [[G5228]] all— [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] testimony that was given [[G3142]] at just the right time. [[G2540]] 
7 For [[G1519]] [this reason] [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] was appointed as [[G5087]] a herald, [[G2783]] an apostle, [[G652]] [and] [[G1722]] a faithful [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] TRUE [[G225]] teacher [[G1320]] of [the] Gentiles. [[G1484]] I am telling [[G3004]] [the] truth; [[G225]] [I am] not [[G3756]] lying [ about anything ]. [[G5574]] 
8 Therefore [[G3767]] I want [[G1014]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] everywhere [[G5117]] to pray, [[G4336]] lifting up [[G1869]] holy [[G3741]] hands, [[G5495]] without [[G5565]] anger [[G3709]] [or] [[G2532]] dissension. [[G1261]] 
9 Likewise, [[G5615]] [I want] [[G2532]] [the] women [[G1135]] to adorn [[G2885]] themselves [[G1438]] with [[G1722]] respectable [[G2887]] apparel, [[G2689]] with [[G3326]] modesty, [[G127]] and [[G2532]] [with] self-control, [[G4997]] not [[G3361]] with [[G1722]] braided hair [[G4117]] or [[G2532]] gold [[G5553]] or [[G2228]] pearls [[G3135]] or [[G2228]] expensive [[G4185]] clothes, [[G2441]] 
10 but [[G235]] with [[G1223]] good [[G18]] deeds, [[G2041]] [as] [[G3739]] is proper [[G4241]] for women [who] [[G1135]] profess [[G1861]] to worship God. [[G2317]] 
11 A woman [[G1135]] must learn [[G3129]] in [[G1722]] quietness [[G2271]] [and] [[G1722]] full [[G3956]] submissiveness. [[G5292]] 
12 I do not permit [[G2010]] a woman [[G1135]] to teach [[G1321]] [or] [[G3761]] exercise authority over [[G831]] a man; [[G435]] she is to remain [[G1510]] quiet. [[G2271]] 
13 For [[G1063]] Adam [[G76]] was formed [[G4111]] first, [[G4413]] and then [[G1534]] Eve. [[G2096]] 
14 And [[G2532]] [it was] not [[G3756]] Adam [[G76]] [who] was deceived, [[G538]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] [who] was deceived [[G1818]] [and] fell [[G1096]] into [[G1722]] transgression. [[G3847]] 
15 Women, however, will be saved [[G4982]] through [[G1223]] childbearing, [[G5042]] if [[G1437]] they continue [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] faith, [[G4102]] love, [[G26]] and [[G2532]] holiness, [[G38]] with [[G3326]] self-control. [[G4997]]
