1 [This is] a trustworthy [[G4103]] saying: [[G3056]] If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] aspires to be [[G3713]] an overseer, [[G1984]] he desires [[G1937]] a noble [[G2570]] task. [[G2041]] 
2 An [[G3588]] overseer, [[G1985]] then, [[G3767]] must [[G1163]] be [[G1510]] above reproach, [[G423]] [the] husband [[G435]] of but one [[G1520]] wife, [[G1135]] temperate, [[G3524]] self-controlled, [[G4998]] respectable, [[G2887]] hospitable, [[G5382]] able to teach, [[G1317]] 
3 not [[G3361]] dependent on wine, [[G3943]] not [[G3361]] violent [[G4131]] but [[G235]] gentle, [[G1933]] peaceable, [[G269]] [and] free of the love of money. [[G866]] 
4 [An overseer must] manage [[G4291]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] household [[G3624]] well [[G2573]] [and] keep [[G2192]] [his] children [[G5043]] under [[G1722]] control, [[G5292]] with [[G3326]] complete [[G3956]] dignity. [[G4587]] 
5 [For] [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] someone [[G5100]] {does} not [[G3756]] know [[G1492]] how [[G4459]] to manage [[G4291]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] household, [[G3624]] [how] can he care for [[G1959]] [the] church [[G1577]] of God? [[G2316]] 
6 [He must] not [be] [[G3361]] a recent convert, [[G3504]] or he may become conceited [[G5187]] [and] fall [[G1706]] under [[G1519]] [ the same ] condemnation [[G2917]] as the [[G3588]] devil. [[G1228]] 
7 Furthermore, [[G1161]] he must [[G1163]] have [[G2192]] a good [[G2570]] reputation [[G3141]] with [[G575]] outsiders, [[G1855]] so that [[G2443]] he will not fall [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] disgrace [[G3680]] and [[G2532]] [into the] snare [[G3803]] of the [[G3588]] devil. [[G1228]] 
8 Deacons [[G1249]] likewise [[G5615]] [must be] dignified, [[G4586]] not [[G3361]] double-tongued [[G1351]] [or] [[G3361]] given [[G4337]] to much [[G4183]] wine [[G3631]] [or] [[G3361]] greedy for money. [[G146]] 
9 They must hold [[G2192]] to the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] with [[G1722]] a clear [[G2513]] conscience. [[G4893]] 
10 Additionally, [[G2532]] they [[G3778]] must first be tested. [[G1381]] Then, [[G1534]] if they are [[G1510]] above reproach, [[G410]] let them serve as deacons. [[G1247]] 
11 In the same way, [[G5615]] [the] women [[G1135]] [must be] dignified, [[G4586]] not [[G3361]] slanderers, [[G1228]] [but] temperate [[G3524]] [and] faithful [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] all things. [[G3956]] 
12 A deacon [[G1249]] must be [[G1510]] [the] husband [[G435]] of but one [[G1520]] wife, [[G1135]] a good [[G2573]] manager [[G4291]] [of his] children [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] [of his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] household. [[G3624]] 
13 For [[G1063]] those who [[G3588]] have served [[G1247]] well [as deacons] [[G2573]] acquire [[G4046]] for themselves [[G1438]] a high [[G2570]] standing [[G898]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] confidence [[G3954]] in [[G1722]] [the] faith [[G4102]] that [is] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
14 [Although] I hope [[G1679]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] soon, [[G5034]] I am writing [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] these things [[G3778]] 
15 so that, [[G2443]] if [[G1437]] I am delayed, [[G1019]] you will know [[G1492]] how [[G4459]] each one must [[G1163]] conduct himself [[G390]] in [[G1722]] God’s [[G2316]] household, [[G3624]] which [[G3748]] is [[G1510]] [the] church [[G1577]] of [the] living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] [the] pillar [[G4769]] and [[G2532]] foundation [[G1477]] of the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] 
16 By common confession, [[G3672]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of godliness [[G2150]] is [[G1510]] great: [[G3173]] [He] [[G3739]] appeared [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] [the] flesh, [[G4561]] was vindicated [[G1344]] by [[G1722]] [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] was seen [[G3708]] by angels, [[G32]] was proclaimed [[G2784]] among [[G1722]] [the] nations, [[G1484]] was believed in [[G4100]] throughout [[G1722]] [the] world, [[G2889]] was taken up [[G353]] in [[G1722]] glory. [[G1391]]
