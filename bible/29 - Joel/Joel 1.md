# Joel 1
[[Hosea 14|←]] • [[Joel 2|→]]
1 [This is] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Joel [[H3100]] son [[H1121]] of Pethuel: [[H6602]] 
2 Hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] O elders; [[H2205]] and give ear, [[H238]] all [[H3605]] who dwell [[H3427]] in the land. [[H776]] Has anything like this [[H2063]] ever happened [[H1961]] in your days [[H3117]] or [[H518]] in the days [[H3117]] of your forefathers? [[H1]] 
3 Tell [[H5608]] your children [[H1121]] about it, [[H5921]] and let your children [[H1121]] tell their children— [[H1121]] and their children, [[H1121]] the next [[H312]] generation. [[H1755]] 
4 What the devouring locust [[H1501]] has left, [[H3499]] the swarming locust [[H697]] has eaten; [[H398]] what the swarming locust [[H697]] has left, [[H3499]] the young locust [[H3218]] has eaten; [[H398]] and what the young locust [[H3218]] has left, [[H3499]] the destroying locust [[H2625]] has eaten. [[H398]] 
5 Wake up, [[H6974]] you drunkards, [[H7910]] and weep; [[H1058]] wail, [[H3213]] all [[H3605]] you drinkers [[H8354]] of wine, [[H3196]] because of [[H5921]] the sweet wine, [[H6071]] for [[H3588]] it has been cut off [[H3772]] from your mouth. [[H6310]] 
6 For [[H3588]] a nation [[H1471]] has invaded [[H5927]] My land, [[H776]] powerful [[H6099]] and without [[H369]] number; [[H4557]] its teeth [[H8127]] are [those] [[H8127]] of a lion, [[H738]] and its fangs [[H4973]] [are those] of a lioness. [[H3833]] 
7 It has laid [[H7760]] waste [[H8047]] My grapevine [[H1612]] and splintered [[H7111]] My fig tree. [[H8384]] It has stripped off the bark [[H2834]] and thrown it away; [[H7993]] the branches [[H8299]] have turned white. [[H3835]] 
8 Wail [[H421]] like a virgin [[H1330]] dressed [[H2296]] in sackcloth, [[H8242]] grieving for [[H5921]] the husband [[H1167]] of her youth. [[H5271]] 
9 Grain and drink offerings [[H4503]] have been cut off [[H3772]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] the priests [[H3548]] are in mourning, [[H56]] those who minister [[H8334]] before the LORD. [[H3068]] 
10 The field [[H7704]] is ruined; [[H7703]] the land [[H127]] mourns; [[H56]] indeed, [[H3588]] the grain [[H1715]] is destroyed; [[H7703]] the new wine [[H8492]] is dried up, [[H3001]] the oil fails. [[H3323]] 
11 Be dismayed, [[H954]] O farmers, [[H406]] wail, [[H3213]] O vinedressers, [[H3755]] over [[H5921]] the wheat [[H2406]] and [[H5921]] barley, [[H8184]] because [[H3588]] the harvest [[H7105]] of the field [[H7704]] has perished. [[H6]] 
12 The grapevine [[H1612]] is dried up, [[H3001]] and the fig tree [[H8384]] is withered; [[H535]] the pomegranate, [[H7416]] palm, [[H8558]] and apple— [[H8598]] all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the orchard— [[H7704]] are withered. [[H3001]] Surely [[H3588]] the joy [[H8342]] of [[H4480]] mankind [[H120]] has dried up. [[H3001]] 
13 Put on [sackcloth] [[H2296]] and lament, [[H5594]] O priests; [[H3548]] wail, [[H3213]] O ministers [[H8334]] of the altar. [[H4196]] Come, [[H935]] spend the night [[H3885]] in sackcloth, [[H8242]] O ministers [[H8334]] of my God, [[H430]] because [[H3588]] the grain [[H4503]] and drink offerings [[H5262]] are withheld [[H4513]] from the house [[H1004]] of your God. [[H430]] 
14 Consecrate [[H6942]] a fast; [[H6685]] proclaim [[H7121]] a solemn assembly! [[H6116]] Gather [[H622]] the elders [[H2205]] and all [[H3605]] the residents [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and cry out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 Alas [[H162]] for the day! [[H3117]] For [[H3588]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is near, [[H7138]] and it will come [[H935]] like destruction [[H7701]] from the Almighty. [[H7706]] 
16 Has not [[H3808]] the food [[H400]] been cut off [[H3772]] before [[H5048]] our very eyes— [[H5869]] joy [[H8057]] and gladness [[H1524]] from the house [[H1004]] of our God? [[H430]] 
17 The seeds [[H6507]] lie shriveled [[H5685]] beneath [[H8478]] the clods; [[H4053]] the storehouses [[H214]] are in ruins; [[H8074]] the granaries [[H4460]] are broken down, [[H2040]] for [[H3588]] the grain [[H1715]] has withered away. [[H3001]] 
18 How [[H4100]] the cattle [[H929]] groan! [[H584]] The herds [[H5739]] wander in confusion [[H943]] because [[H3588]] they have no [[H369]] pasture. [[H4829]] Even [[H1571]] the flocks [[H5739]] of sheep [[H6629]] are suffering. [[H816]] 
19 To You, [[H413]] O LORD, [[H3068]] I call, [[H7121]] for [[H3588]] fire [[H784]] has consumed [[H398]] the open [[H4057]] pastures [[H4999]] and flames [[H3852]] have scorched [[H3857]] all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field. [[H7704]] 
20 Even [[H1571]] the beasts [[H929]] of the field [[H7704]] pant [[H6165]] for You, [[H413]] for [[H3588]] the streams [[H650]] of water [[H4325]] have dried up, [[H3001]] and fire [[H784]] has consumed [[H398]] the open [[H4057]] pastures. [[H4999]]
