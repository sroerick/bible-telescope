1 Blow [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] in Zion; [[H6726]] sound the alarm [[H7321]] on My holy [[H6944]] mountain! [[H2022]] Let all [[H3605]] who dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] tremble, [[H7264]] for [[H3588]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is coming; [[H935]] in fact, [[H3588]] it is at hand— [[H7138]] 
2 a day [[H3117]] of darkness [[H2822]] and gloom, [[H653]] a day [[H3117]] of clouds [[H6051]] and blackness. [[H6205]] Like the dawn [[H7837]] overspreading [[H6566]] the mountains [[H2022]] a great [[H7227]] and strong [[H6099]] people appears, [[H5971]] such as [[H3644]] never [[H3808]] was [[H1961]] of [[H4480]] old, [[H5769]] nor will ever be [[H3808]] in ages [[H8141]] to come. [[H310]] 
3 Before them [[H6440]] a fire [[H784]] devours, [[H398]] and behind [[H310]] them a flame [[H3852]] scorches. [[H3857]] The land [[H776]] before them [[H6440]] is like the Garden [[H1588]] of Eden, [[H5731]] but behind them, [[H310]] it is like a desert [[H4057]] wasteland— [[H8077]] surely [[H1571]] nothing [[H3808]] will [[H1961]] escape [[H6413]] them.  
4 Their appearance [[H4758]] is like that [[H4758]] of horses, [[H5483]] and they gallop [[H7323]] like swift steeds. [[H6571]] 
5 With a sound like [[H6963]] that of chariots [[H4818]] they bound [[H7540]] over [[H5921]] the mountaintops, [[H2022]] like the crackling [[H6963]] of fire [[H784]] consuming [[H398]] stubble, [[H7179]] like a mighty [[H6099]] army [[H5971]] deployed [[H6186]] for battle. [[H4421]] 
6 Nations [[H5971]] writhe in horror [[H2342]] before them; [[H6440]] every [[H3605]] face [[H6440]] turns pale. [[H6908]] 
7 They charge [[H7323]] like mighty men; [[H1368]] they scale [[H5927]] walls [[H2346]] like men [[H376]] of war. [[H4421]] Each one [[H376]] marches [[H1980]] in formation, [[H1870]] not [[H3808]] swerving [[H5670]] from the course. [[H734]] 
8 They do not [[H3808]] jostle [[H1766]] one [[H376]] another; [[H251]] each man [[H1397]] proceeds [[H1980]] in his column, [[H4546]] as they burst through [[H5307]] the defenses, [[H7973]] never [[H3808]] breaking ranks. [[H1214]] 
9 They storm [[H8264]] the city; [[H5892]] they run [[H7323]] along the wall; [[H2346]] they climb [[H5927]] into houses, [[H1004]] entering [[H935]] through [[H1157]] windows [[H2474]] like thieves. [[H1590]] 
10 Before them [[H6440]] the earth [[H776]] quakes; [[H7264]] the heavens [[H8064]] tremble. [[H7493]] The sun [[H8121]] and moon [[H3394]] grow dark, [[H6937]] and the stars [[H3556]] lose [[H622]] their brightness. [[H5051]] 
11 The LORD [[H3069]] raises [[H5414]] His voice [[H6963]] in the presence [[H6440]] of His army. [[H2426]] Indeed, [[H3588]] His camp [[H4264]] is very [[H3966]] large, [[H7227]] for [[H3588]] mighty [are] [[H6099]] those who obey [[H6213]] His command. [[H1697]] For [[H3588]] the day of [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3069]] [is] great [[H1419]] and very [[H3966]] dreadful. [[H3372]] Who [[H4310]] can endure it? [[H3557]] 
12 Yet even [[H1571]] now, [[H6258]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] return [[H7725]] to Me [[H5704]] with all [[H3605]] your heart, [[H3824]] with fasting, [[H6685]] weeping, [[H1065]] and mourning. [[H4553]] 
13 So rend [[H7167]] your hearts [[H3824]] and not [[H408]] your garments, [[H899]] and return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] For [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] is gracious [[H2587]] and compassionate, [[H7349]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] and abounding [[H7227]] in loving devotion. [[H2617]] And He relents [[H5162]] from [[H5921]] sending disaster. [[H7451]] 
14 Who [[H4310]] knows? [[H3045]] He may turn [[H7725]] and relent [[H5162]] and leave [[H7604]] a blessing [[H1293]] behind Him— [[H310]] grain [[H4503]] and drink offerings [[H5262]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
15 Blow [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] in Zion, [[H6726]] consecrate [[H6942]] a fast, [[H6685]] proclaim [[H7121]] a sacred assembly. [[H6116]] 
16 Gather [[H622]] the people, [[H5971]] sanctify [[H6942]] the congregation, [[H6951]] assemble [[H6908]] the aged, [[H2205]] gather [[H622]] the children, [[H5768]] even those nursing [[H3243]] at the breast. [[H7699]] Let the bridegroom [[H2860]] leave [[H3318]] his room, [[H2315]] and the bride [[H3618]] her chamber. [[H2646]] 
17 Let the priests [[H3548]] who minister [[H8334]] before the LORD [[H3068]] weep [[H1058]] between [[H996]] the porch [[H197]] and the altar, [[H4196]] saying, [[H559]] “Spare [[H2347]] Your people, [[H5971]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and do not [[H408]] make [[H5414]] Your heritage [[H5159]] a reproach, [[H2781]] an object of scorn [[H4910]] among the nations. [[H1471]] Why [[H4100]] should they say [[H559]] among the peoples, [[H5971]] Where [[H346]] is their God? [[H430]] 
18 Then the LORD [[H3068]] became jealous [[H7065]] for His land [[H776]] and spared [[H2550]] His people. [[H5971]] 
19 And the LORD [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] His people: [[H5971]] “Behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]] you  grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and oil. [[H3323]] And by them [[H854]] you will be satisfied [[H7646]] and I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] make you [[H5414]] a reproach [[H2781]] among the nations. [[H1471]] 
20 But [[H853]] the northern [army] [[H6830]] I will remove far [[H7368]] from you, [[H5921]] banishing it [[H5080]] to [[H413]] a barren [[H6723]] and desolate [[H8077]] land, [[H776]] its front [[H6440]] ranks [[H413]] into the eastern [[H6931]] sea, [[H3220]] and its rear guard [[H5490]] into [[H413]] the western [[H314]] sea. [[H3220]] And its stench [[H889]] will rise; [[H5927]] its foul odor [[H6709]] will go up. [[H5927]] For [[H3588]] He has done [[H6213]] great things. [[H1431]] 
21 Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] O land; [[H127]] rejoice [[H1523]] and be glad, [[H8055]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has done [[H6213]] great things. [[H1431]] 
22 Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] O beasts [[H929]] of the field, [[H7704]] for [[H3588]] the open [[H4057]] pastures [[H4999]] have turned green, [[H1876]] the trees [[H6086]] bear [[H5375]] their fruit, [[H6529]] and the fig tree [[H8384]] and vine [[H1612]] yield [[H5414]] to their fullest. [[H2426]] 
23 Be glad, [[H1523]] O children [[H1121]] of Zion, [[H6726]] and rejoice [[H8055]] in the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] He has given [[H5414]] you  the autumn rains [[H4175]] for your vindication. [[H6666]] He sends [[H3381]] you  showers, [[H1653]] both autumn [[H4175]] and spring rains, [[H4456]] as before. [[H7223]] 
24 The threshing floors [[H1637]] will be full of [[H4390]] grain, [[H1250]] and the vats [[H3342]] will overflow [[H7783]] with new wine [[H8492]] and oil. [[H3323]] 
25 I will repay [[H7999]] you  for the years [[H8141]] that [[H834]] the swarming locusts [[H697]] have eaten— [[H398]] the young locust, [[H3218]] the destroying locust, [[H2625]] and the devouring locust— [[H1501]] My great [[H1419]] army [[H2426]] that [[H834]] I sent [[H7971]] against you.  
26 You will have plenty to eat, [[H398]] until you are satisfied. [[H7646]] You will praise [[H1984]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] has worked [[H6213]] wonders [[H6381]] for you. [[H5973]] My people [[H5971]] will never again [[H3808]] be put to shame. [[H954]] 
27 Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am present in [[H7130]] Israel [[H3478]] and that I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and there is no [[H369]] other. [[H5750]] My people [[H5971]] will never again [[H3808]] be put to shame. [[H954]] 
28 And [[H1961]] afterward, [[H310]] I will pour out [[H8210]] My Spirit [[H7307]] on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] people. [[H1320]] Your sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] will prophesy, [[H5012]] your old [[H2205]] men will dream dreams, [[H2472]] your young men [[H970]] will see [[H7200]] visions. [[H2384]] 
29 Even [[H1571]] on [[H5921]] [My] menservants [[H5650]] and [[H5921]] maidservants, [[H8198]] I will pour out [[H8210]] My Spirit [[H7307]] in those [[H1992]] days. [[H3117]] 
30 I will show [[H5414]] wonders [[H4159]] in the heavens [[H8064]] and on the earth, [[H776]] blood [[H1818]] and fire [[H784]] and columns [[H8490]] of smoke. [[H6227]] 
31 The sun [[H8121]] will be turned [[H2015]] to darkness [[H2822]] and the moon [[H3394]] to blood [[H1818]] before [[H6440]] the coming [[H935]] of the great [[H1419]] and awesome [[H3372]] day [[H3117]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
32 And [[H1961]] everyone [[H3605]] who [[H834]] calls [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be saved, [[H4422]] for [[H3588]] on Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] and in Jerusalem [[H3389]] there will be [[H1961]] deliverance, [[H6413]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] promised, [[H559]] among the remnant [[H8300]] called [[H7121]] by the LORD. [[H3068]]
