1 Therefore, [[G5620]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] whom I love and long for, [[G1973]] my [[G1473]] joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] crown, [[G4735]] that is how [[G3779]] you must stand firm [[G4739]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] my beloved. [[G27]] 
2 I urge [[G3870]] Euodia [[G2136]] and [[G2532]] Syntyche [[G4941]] to agree [[G5426]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
3 Yes, [[G3483]] and [[G2532]] I ask [[G2065]] you, [[G4771]] [my] true [[G1103]] yokefellow, [[G4805]] to help [[G4815]] these [women] [[G846]] who [[G3748]] have labored [[G4866]] with me [[G1473]] for [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] along [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] Clement [[G2815]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] of my [[G1473]] fellow workers, [[G4904]] whose [[G3739]] names [are] [[G3686]] in [[G1722]] [the] book [[G976]] of life. [[G2222]] 
4 Rejoice [[G5463]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] always. [[G3842]] I will say [it] [[G2046]] again: [[G3825]] Rejoice! [[G5463]] 
5 {Let} your [[G4771]] gentleness [[G1933]] be apparent [[G1097]] to all. [[G3956]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] [is] near. [[G1451]] 
6 Be anxious for [[G3309]] nothing, [[G3367]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] everything, [[G3956]] by [[G3588]] prayer [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] petition, [[G1162]] with [[G3326]] thanksgiving, [[G2169]] present [[G1107]] your [[G4771]] requests [[G155]] to [[G4314]] God. [[G2316]] 
7 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] peace [[G1515]] of God, [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] surpasses [[G5242]] all [[G3956]] understanding, [[G3563]] will guard [[G5432]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] minds [[G3540]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
8 Finally, [[G3063]] brothers, [[G80]] whatever [[G3745]] is [[G1510]] true, [[G227]] whatever [[G3745]] [is] honorable, [[G4586]] whatever [[G3745]] [is] right, [[G1342]] whatever [[G3745]] [is] pure, [[G53]] whatever [[G3745]] [is] lovely, [[G4375]] whatever [[G3745]] [is] admirable— [[G2163]] if [[G1487]] anything [[G5100]] [is] [[G5100]] excellent [[G703]] [or] [[G2532]] praiseworthy— [[G1868]] think on [[G3049]] these things. [[G3778]] 
9 Whatever [[G3739]] you have learned [[G3129]] or [[G2532]] received [[G3880]] or [[G2532]] heard [from me], [[G191]] or [[G2532]] seen [[G3708]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1473]] put into practice. [[G4238]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of peace [[G1515]] will be [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you. [[G4771]] 
10 Now [[G1161]] I rejoice [[G5463]] greatly [[G3171]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] that [[G3754]] at last [[G4218]] you have revived [[G330]] [your] [[G3588]] concern [[G5426]] for [[G5228]] me. [[G1473]] You were indeed concerned, [[G5426]] but [[G1161]] you had no opportunity [to show it]. [[G170]] 
11 I am not saying this [[G3004]] out of [[G2596]] need, [[G5304]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] have learned [[G3129]] to be [[G1510]] content [[G842]] regardless of my circumstances. [[G1722]] 
12 I know [[G1492]] [how] to live humbly, [[G5013]] and [[G2532]] I know [[G1492]] [how] to abound. [[G4052]] I am accustomed [[G3453]] to [[G1722]] any [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] every situation— [[G3956]] to being filled [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] being hungry, [[G3983]] to having plenty [[G4052]] and [[G2532]] having need. [[G5302]] 
13 I can do [[G2480]] all things [[G3956]] through [[G1722]] [Christ] who [[G3588]] gives me strength. [[G1743]] 
14 Nevertheless, [[G4133]] you have done [[G4160]] well [[G2573]] to share in [[G4790]] my [[G1473]] affliction. [[G2347]] 
15 And as [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] Philippians [[G5374]] know, [[G1492]] in [[G1722]] [the] early days [[G746]] of the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] when [[G3753]] I left [[G1831]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] no [[G3762]] church [[G1577]] but [[G1487]] you [[G4771]] partnered [[G2841]] with me [[G1473]] in [[G1519]] the matter [[G3056]] of giving [[G1394]] and [[G2532]] receiving. [[G3028]] 
16 For [[G3754]] even [[G2532]] [while I was] in [[G1722]] Thessalonica, [[G2332]] you provided [[G3992]] for [[G1519]] my [[G1473]] needs [[G5532]] once [[G530]] and [[G2532]] again. [[G1364]] 
17 Not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] I am seeking [[G1934]] a [[G3588]] gift, [[G1390]] but [[G235]] I am looking for [[G1934]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] that [[G3588]] may be credited [[G4121]] to [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] account. [[G3056]] 
18 I have [[G568]] all [[G3956]] I need [[G4137]] and [[G2532]] more, [[G4052]] now that I have received [[G1209]] your [[G4771]] gifts [[G3588]] from [[G3844]] Epaphroditus. [[G1891]] [They are] a sweet smelling [[G2175]] aroma, [[G3744]] an acceptable [[G1184]] sacrifice, [[G2378]] well-pleasing [[G2101]] to God. [[G2316]] 
19 And [[G1161]] my [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] will supply [[G4137]] all [[G3956]] your [[G4771]] needs [[G5532]] according to [[G2596]] His [[G846]] glorious [[G1391]] riches [[G4149]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
20 To [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] [be] [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]] 
21 Greet [[G782]] all [[G3956]] the saints [[G40]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] The [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] who are with [[G4862]] me [[G1473]] send you greetings. [[G782]] 
22 All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] send you greetings, [[G782]] especially [[G3122]] those [[G3588]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] household [[G3614]] of Caesar. [[G2541]] 
23 The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [be] with [[G3326]] your [[G4771]] spirit. [[G4151]]
