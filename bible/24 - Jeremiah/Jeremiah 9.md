# Jeremiah 9
[[Jeremiah 8|←]] • [[Jeremiah 10|→]]
1 Oh, that [[H5414]] my head [[H7218]] were a spring of water, [[H4325]] and my eyes [[H5869]] a fountain [[H4726]] of tears, [[H1832]] I would weep [[H1058]] day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] over the slain [[H2491]] daughter [[H1323]] of my people. [[H5971]] 
2 If only [[H4310]] I had a traveler’s [[H732]] lodge [[H4411]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] I would abandon [[H5800]] my people [[H5971]] and depart [[H1980]] from them, [[H853]] for [[H3588]] they are all [[H3605]] adulterers, [[H5003]] a crowd [[H6116]] of faithless people. [[H898]] 
3 “They bend [[H1869]] their tongue [[H3956]] like their bows; [[H7198]] lies [[H8267]] instead of [[H3808]] truth [[H530]] prevail [[H1396]] in the land, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] they proceed [[H3318]] from evil [[H7451]] to [[H413]] evil, [[H7451]] and they do not [[H3808]] take Me into account,” [[H3045]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 “Let everyone [[H376]] guard [[H8104]] against [[H5921]] his neighbor; [[H7453]] do not [[H408]] trust [[H982]] any [[H3605]] brother, [[H251]] for [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] brother [[H251]] deals [[H6117]] craftily, [[H6117]] and every [[H3605]] friend [[H7453]] spreads [[H1980]] slander. [[H7400]] 
5 Each one [[H376]] betrays [[H2048]] his friend; [[H7453]] no [[H3808]] one tells [[H1696]] the truth. [[H571]] They have taught [[H3925]] their tongues [[H3956]] to lie; [[H1696]] they wear themselves out [[H3811]] committing iniquity. [[H5753]] 
6 You dwell [[H3427]] in the midst [[H8432]] of deception; [[H4820]] in their deceit [[H4820]] they refuse [[H3985]] to know [[H3045]] Me,” [[H853]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] I will refine [[H6884]] and test them, [[H974]] for [[H3588]] what [[H349]] else can I do [[H6213]] because of [[H6440]] the daughter [[H1323]] of My people? [[H5971]] 
8 Their tongues [[H3956]] are deadly [[H7819]] arrows; [[H2671]] they speak [[H1696]] deception. [[H4820]] With his mouth [[H6310]] a man speaks [[H1696]] peace [[H7965]] to [[H854]] his neighbor, [[H7453]] but in his heart [[H7130]] he sets [[H7760]] a trap for him. [[H696]] 
9 Should I not [[H3808]] punish them [[H6485]] for [[H5921]] these things? [[H428]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Should I not [[H3808]] avenge [[H5358]] Myself [[H5315]] on [[H518]] such a nation [[H1471]] as this?” [[H2088]] 
10 I will take up [[H5375]] a weeping [[H1065]] and wailing [[H5092]] for [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] a dirge [[H7015]] over [[H5921]] the wilderness [[H4057]] pasture, [[H4999]] for [[H3588]] they have been scorched [[H3341]] so no [[H1097]] one [[H376]] passes through, [[H5674]] and the lowing [[H6963]] of cattle [[H4735]] is not [[H3808]] heard. [[H8085]] Both the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] and [[H5704]] the beasts [[H929]] have fled; [[H5074]] they have gone away. [[H1980]] 
11 “And I will make [[H5414]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a heap of rubble, [[H1530]] a haunt [[H4583]] for jackals; [[H8577]] and I will make [[H5414]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] a desolation, [[H8077]] without [[H1097]] inhabitant.” [[H3427]] 
12 Who [[H4310]] is the man [[H376]] wise [[H2450]] enough to understand [[H995]] this? [[H2063]] To whom [[H834]] has the mouth [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] spoken, [[H1696]] that he may explain it? [[H5046]] Why [[H5921]] is the land [[H776]] destroyed [[H6]] and scorched [[H3341]] like a desert, [[H4057]] so no [[H1097]] one can pass through it? [[H5674]] 
13 And the LORD [[H3069]] answered, [[H559]] “It is because [[H5921]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] My law [[H8451]] that [[H834]] I set [[H5414]] before them; [[H6440]] they have not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in it  [or] [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] My voice. [[H6963]] 
14 Instead, they have followed [[H1980]] the stubbornness [[H8307]] of their hearts [[H3820]] and gone after [[H310]] the Baals, [[H1168]] as [[H834]] their fathers [[H1]] taught them.” [[H3925]] 
15 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] I will feed [[H398]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] wormwood [[H3939]] and give them poisoned [[H7219]] water [[H4325]] to drink. [[H8248]] 
16 I will scatter [[H6327]] them among the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] they [[H1992]] [nor] their fathers [[H1]] have known, [[H3045]] and I will send [[H7971]] a sword [[H2719]] after [[H310]] them until [[H5704]] I have finished them off.” [[H3615]] 
17 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Take note, [[H995]] and summon [[H7121]] the wailing women; [[H6969]] send [[H7971]] for [[H413]] the [most] skillful [among them]. [[H2450]] 
18 Let them come quickly [[H4116]] and take up [[H5375]] a lament [[H5092]] over us, [[H5921]] that our eyes [[H5869]] may overflow [[H3381]] with tears, [[H1832]] and our eyelids [[H6079]] may stream [[H5140]] with waters. [[H4325]] 
19 For [[H3588]] the sound [[H6963]] of wailing [[H5092]] is heard [[H8085]] from Zion: [[H6726]] ‘How [[H349]] devastated we are! [[H7703]] How great [[H3966]] is our shame, [[H954]] for [[H3588]] we have abandoned [[H5800]] the land [[H776]] because [[H3588]] our dwellings [[H4908]] have been torn down.’” [[H7993]] 
20 Now, [[H3588]] O women, [[H802]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Open [[H3947]] your ears [[H241]] to the word [[H1697]] of His mouth. [[H6310]] Teach [[H3925]] your daughters [[H1323]] to wail, [[H5092]] and one [[H802]] another [[H7468]] to lament. [[H7015]] 
21 For [[H3588]] death [[H4194]] has climbed in [[H5927]] through our windows; [[H2474]] it has entered [[H935]] our fortresses, [[H759]] to cut off [[H3772]] the children [[H5768]] from the streets, [[H2351]] the young men [[H970]] from the town squares. [[H7339]] 
22 Declare that [[H1696]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H5002]] “The corpses [[H5038]] of men [[H120]] will fall [[H5307]] like dung [[H1828]] upon [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] field, [[H7704]] like newly cut grain [[H5995]] behind [[H310]] the reaper, [[H7114]] with no [[H369]] one to gather it.” [[H622]] 
23 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Let not [[H408]] the wise [man] [[H2450]] boast [[H1984]] in his wisdom, [[H2451]] nor [[H408]] the strong man [[H1368]] in his strength, [[H1369]] nor [[H408]] the wealthy man [[H6223]] in his riches. [[H6239]] 
24 But [[H3588]] let him who boasts [[H1984]] boast [[H1984]] in this, [[H2063]] that he understands [[H7919]] and knows [[H3045]] Me, [[H853]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] who exercises [[H6213]] loving devotion, [[H2617]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6666]] on the earth— [[H776]] for [[H3588]] I delight [[H2654]] in these things,” [[H428]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
25 “Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming,” [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “when I will punish [[H6485]] all who are [[H3605]] circumcised [[H4135]] yet uncircumcised: [[H6190]] 
26 Egypt, [[H4714]] Judah, [[H3063]] Edom, [[H123]] Ammon, [[H5983]] Moab, [[H4124]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the desert [[H4057]] who clip the hair [[H7112]] of their temples. [[H6285]] All [[H3605]] these nations [[H1471]] [are really] uncircumcised, [[H6189]] and even the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] is uncircumcised [[H6189]] in heart.” [[H3820]]
