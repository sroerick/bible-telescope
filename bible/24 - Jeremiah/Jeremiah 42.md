1 Then all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the forces, [[H2428]] along with Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] Jezaniah [[H3153]] son [[H1121]] of Hoshaiah, [[H1955]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] from the least [[H6996]] to [[H5704]] the greatest, [[H1419]] approached [[H5066]] 
2 Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] and said, [[H559]] “May our petition [[H8467]] come [[H5307]] before you; [[H6440]] pray [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] on behalf of [[H1157]] this [[H2063]] entire [[H3605]] remnant. [[H7611]] For [[H3588]] few [[H4592]] of us remain [[H7604]] of the many, [[H7235]] as [[H834]] you can see [[H7200]] with your own eyes. [[H5869]] 
3 [Pray] that the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] may tell [[H5046]] us the way [[H1870]] we should walk [[H1980]] and the thing [[H1697]] we should do.” [[H6213]] 
4 “I have heard you,” [[H8085]] replied [[H559]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet. [[H5030]] “I will surely [[H2005]] pray [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] as you request, [[H1697]] and I will tell you [[H5046]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] answers; [[H6030]] I will not [[H3808]] withhold [[H4513]] a word [[H1697]] from you.” [[H4480]] 
5 Then they [[H1992]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] a true [[H571]] and faithful [[H539]] witness against us [[H5707]] if [[H518]] we do not [[H3808]] act upon [[H6213]] every [[H3605]] word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] sends you [[H7971]] to tell us. [[H413]] 
6 Whether [[H518]] it is pleasant [[H2896]] or [[H518]] unpleasant, [[H7451]] we will obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] to [[H413]] whom [[H834]] we [[H580]] are sending [[H7971]] you, [[H853]] so that [[H4616]] it may go well with us, [[H3190]] for [[H3588]] we will obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God!” [[H430]] 
7 After [[H7093]] ten [[H6235]] days, [[H3117]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] 
8 and he summoned [[H7121]] Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the forces [[H2428]] who [[H834]] were with him, [[H854]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] from the least [[H6996]] to [[H5704]] the greatest. [[H1419]] 
9 [Jeremiah] told [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to [[H413]] whom [[H834]] you sent [[H7971]] me [[H853]] to present [[H5307]] your petition: [[H8467]] 
10 If [[H518]] you will indeed stay [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] then I will build [[H1129]] you up [[H853]] and not [[H3808]] tear you down; [[H2040]] I will plant [[H5193]] you [[H853]] and not [[H3808]] uproot you, [[H5428]] for [[H3588]] I shall relent [[H5162]] of [[H413]] the disaster [[H7451]] I have brought [[H6213]] upon you.  
11 Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of [[H4480]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] whom [[H834]] you [[H859]] now fear; [[H3373]] do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of him, [[H6440]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am with [[H854]] you to save [[H3467]] you [[H853]] and deliver [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from him. [[H3027]] 
12 And I will show [[H5414]] you  compassion, [[H7356]] and he will have compassion [[H7355]] on you [[H853]] and restore [[H7725]] you [[H853]] to [[H413]] your own land. [[H127]] 
13 But if [[H518]] you [[H859]] say, [[H559]] ‘We will not [[H3808]] stay [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] land,’ [[H776]] and so disobey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] 
14 and if you say, [[H559]] ‘No, [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] we will go [[H935]] to the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and live [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] where [[H834]] we will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] war, [[H4421]] or hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] or hunger [[H7456]] for food,’ [[H3899]] 
15 then [[H6258]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] O remnant [[H7611]] of Judah! [[H3063]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] If [[H518]] you [[H859]] are determined [[H7760]] to go [[H935]] to Egypt [[H4714]] and reside [[H1481]] there, [[H8033]] 
16 then the sword [[H2719]] you [[H859]] fear [[H3372]] will overtake [[H5381]] you [[H853]] there, [[H8033]] and the famine [[H7458]] you [[H859]] dread [[H1672]] will follow on your heels [[H1692]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] and you will die [[H4191]] there. [[H8033]] 
17 So all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] resolve [[H7760]] to go [[H935]] to Egypt [[H4714]] to reside there [[H8033]] will [[H1961]] die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague. [[H1698]] Not one [[H3808]] of them will [[H1961]] survive [[H8300]] or escape [[H6412]] the disaster [[H7451]] I [[H589]] will bring [[H935]] upon them. [[H5921]] 
18 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Just as [[H834]] My anger [[H639]] and wrath [[H2534]] were poured out [[H5413]] on [[H5921]] the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] so [[H3651]] will My wrath [[H2534]] be poured out [[H5413]] on you [[H5921]] if you go [[H935]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] You will become [[H1961]] an object of cursing [[H423]] and horror, [[H8047]] of vilification [[H7045]] and disgrace, [[H2781]] and you will never [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] again. [[H5750]] 
19 The LORD [[H3068]] has told [[H1696]] you, [[H5921]] O remnant [[H7611]] of Judah, [[H3063]] ‘Do not [[H408]] go [[H935]] to Egypt.’ [[H4714]] Know [[H3045]] for sure [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I have warned [[H5749]] you  today! [[H3117]] 
20 For [[H3588]] you [[H5315]] have deceived [[H8582]] yourselves [[H859]] by sending [[H7971]] me [[H853]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Pray [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] on our behalf, [[H5704]] and as for all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] says, [[H559]] tell it to us, [[H5046]] and we will do it. [[H6213]] 
21 For I have told [[H5046]] you  today, [[H3117]] but you have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in all [[H3605]] He has sent me [[H7971]] to tell you. [[H413]] 
22 Now therefore, [[H6258]] know [[H3045]] for sure [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] by the sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague [[H1698]] you will die [[H4191]] in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] you desire [[H2654]] to go [[H935]] to reside.” [[H1481]]
