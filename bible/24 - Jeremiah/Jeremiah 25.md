# Jeremiah 25
[[Jeremiah 24|←]] • [[Jeremiah 26|→]]
1 This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H5921]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] concerning [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which [[H1931]] was the first [[H7224]] year [[H8141]] of Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]] 
2 So [[H834]] the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] and all [[H3605]] the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] as follows: [[H559]] 
3 “From [[H4480]] the thirteenth [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of Josiah [[H2977]] son [[H1121]] of Amon [[H526]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] until [[H5704]] this very [[H2088]] day— [[H3117]] twenty-three [[H7969]] years— [[H8141]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has come [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] and I have spoken [[H1696]] to you [[H413]] again [[H7925]] and again, [[H1696]] but you have not [[H3808]] listened. [[H8085]] 
4 And the LORD [[H3068]] has sent [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] His servants [[H5650]] the prophets [[H5030]] to [[H413]] you [[H853]] again [[H7925]] and again, [[H7971]] but you have not [[H3808]] listened [[H8085]] [or] [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] your ear [[H241]] to hear. [[H8085]] 
5 [The prophets] told [you], [[H559]] ‘Turn [[H7725]] now, [[H4994]] each [[H376]] of you, [[H4480]] from your evil [[H7451]] ways [[H1870]] and evil [[H7455]] deeds, [[H4611]] and you can dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] that [[H834]] the LORD has given [[H5414]] to you  and to your fathers [[H1]] forever [[H5769]] and [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]] 
6 Do not [[H408]] follow [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve [[H5647]] them and to worship them, [[H7812]] and do not [[H3808]] provoke Me to anger [[H3707]] with the works [[H4639]] of your hands. [[H3027]] Then I will do you no [[H3808]] harm.’ [[H7489]] 
7 ‘But to your own harm, [[H7451]] you have not [[H3808]] listened [[H8085]] to Me,’ [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] ‘so [[H4616]] you have provoked Me to anger [[H3707]] with the works [[H4639]] of your hands.’ [[H3027]] 
8 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] My words, [[H1697]] 
9 behold, [[H2005]] I will summon [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the north, [[H6828]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and [I will send for] [[H413]] My servant [[H5650]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]] I will bring them [[H935]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] against [[H5921]] its residents, [[H3427]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the [[H428]] surrounding [[H5439]] nations. [[H1471]] So I will completely destroy [[H2763]] them and make them [[H7760]] an object of horror [[H8047]] and contempt, [[H8322]] an everlasting [[H5769]] desolation. [[H2723]] 
10 Moreover, I will banish [[H6]] from them [[H1992]] the sounds [[H6963]] of joy [[H8342]] and gladness, [[H8057]] the voices [[H6963]] of the bride [[H3618]] and [[H6963]] bridegroom, [[H2860]] the sound [[H6963]] of the millstones, [[H7347]] and the light [[H216]] of the lamp. [[H5216]] 
11 And this [[H2063]] whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] will become [[H1961]] a desolate [[H2723]] wasteland, [[H8047]] and these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] will serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] for seventy [[H7657]] years. [[H8141]] 
12 But when [[H1961]] seventy [[H7657]] years [[H8141]] are complete, [[H4390]] I will punish [[H6485]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and that [[H1931]] nation, [[H1471]] the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] for their guilt, [[H5771]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and I will make [[H7760]] it [[H853]] an everlasting [[H5769]] desolation. [[H8077]] 
13 I will bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] I have pronounced [[H1696]] against it, [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book, [[H5612]] which [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] prophesied [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations. [[H1471]] 
14 For [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] and great [[H1419]] kings [[H4428]] will enslave them, [[H5647]] and I will repay [[H7999]] them according to their deeds [[H6467]] and according to the work [[H4639]] of their hands.’” [[H3027]] 
15 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Take [[H3947]] from My hand [[H3027]] this [[H2063]] cup [[H3563]] of the wine [[H3196]] of wrath, [[H2534]] and make all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] to whom [[H834]] I [[H595]] send [[H7971]] you [[H413]] drink from it. [[H8248]] 
16 And they will drink [[H8354]] and stagger [[H1607]] and go out of their minds, [[H1984]] because of [[H6440]] the sword [[H2719]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] will send [[H7971]] among them.” [[H996]] 
17 So I took [[H3947]] the cup [[H3563]] from the LORD’s [[H3068]] hand [[H3027]] and made all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] drink [[H8248]] from it, [[H853]] each one to whom [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] had sent me, [[H7971]] 
18 to make [[H5414]] them [[H853]] a ruin, [[H2723]] an object of horror [[H8047]] and contempt [[H8322]] and cursing, [[H7045]] as they are this [[H2088]] day— [[H3117]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] its kings [[H4428]] and officials; [[H8269]] 
19 Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] his officials, [[H5650]] his leaders, [[H8269]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] his people; [[H5971]] 
20 all [[H3605]] the mixed tribes; [[H6154]] all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Uz; [[H5780]] all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] Ashkelon, [[H831]] Gaza, [[H5804]] Ekron, [[H6138]] and the remnant [[H7611]] of Ashdod; [[H795]] 
21 Edom, [[H123]] Moab, [[H4124]] and the Ammonites; [[H1121]] 
22 all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Tyre [[H6865]] and [[H853]] Sidon; [[H6721]] the kings [[H4428]] of the coastlands [[H339]] across [[H5676]] the sea; [[H3220]] 
23 Dedan, [[H1719]] Tema, [[H8485]] Buz, [[H938]] and all [[H3605]] who cut [[H7112]] the corners [of their hair]; [[H6285]] 
24 all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Arabia, [[H6152]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the mixed tribes [[H6154]] who dwell [[H7931]] in the desert; [[H4057]] 
25 all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Zimri, [[H2174]] Elam, [[H5867]] and [[H853]] Media; [[H4074]] 
26 all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the north, [[H6828]] both near [[H7138]] and far, [[H7350]] one [[H376]] after [[H413]] another— [[H251]] all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]] And after all of them, [[H310]] the king [[H4428]] of Sheshach [[H8347]] will drink [it too]. [[H8354]] 
27 Then you are to tell [[H559]] them, [[H413]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] Drink, [[H8354]] get drunk, [[H7937]] and vomit. [[H7006]] Fall down [[H5307]] and never [[H3808]] get up again, [[H6965]] because of [[H6440]] the sword [[H2719]] I [[H595]] will send [[H7971]] among you.’ [[H996]] 
28 If [[H3588]] they refuse [[H3985]] to take [[H3947]] the cup [[H3563]] from your hand [[H3027]] [and] drink it, [[H8354]] you are to tell [[H559]] them, [[H413]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] You most certainly must [[H8354]] drink it! [[H8354]] 
29 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] am beginning [[H2490]] to bring disaster [[H7489]] on the city [[H5892]] that [[H834]] bears My name, [[H8034]] so how could you [[H859]] possibly go unpunished? [[H5352]] You will not [[H3808]] go unpunished, [[H5352]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am calling down [[H7121]] a sword [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the earth, [[H776]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
30 So you [[H859]] are to prophesy [[H5012]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] against [[H413]] them [[H853]] and say [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] will roar [[H7580]] from on high; [[H4791]] He will raise [[H5414]] His voice [[H6963]] from His holy [[H6944]] habitation. [[H4583]] He will roar loudly [[H7580]] over [[H5921]] His pasture; [[H5116]] like those who tread the grapes, [[H1869]] He will call out [[H6030]] with a shout, [[H1959]] against [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
31 The tumult [[H7588]] will resound [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the ends [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] brings a charge [[H7379]] against the nations. [[H1471]] He [[H1931]] enters into judgment [[H8199]] on all [[H3605]] mankind [[H1320]] and puts [[H5414]] the wicked [[H7563]] to the sword,’ [[H2719]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
32 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Behold! [[H2009]] Disaster [[H7451]] is spreading [[H3318]] from nation [[H1471]] to [[H413]] nation; [[H1471]] a mighty [[H1419]] storm [[H5591]] is rising [[H5782]] from the ends [[H3411]] of the earth.” [[H776]] 
33 Those slain [[H2491]] by the LORD [[H3068]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] will be spread [[H1961]] from [one] end [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] to [[H5704]] the other. [[H7097]] They will not [[H3808]] be mourned, [[H5594]] gathered, [[H622]] or buried. [[H6912]] They will be [[H1961]] like dung [[H1828]] lying [[H5921]] on [[H6440]] the ground. [[H127]] 
34 Wail, [[H3213]] you shepherds, [[H7462]] and cry out; [[H2199]] roll in the dust, [[H6428]] you leaders [[H117]] of the flock. [[H6629]] For [[H3588]] the days [[H3117]] of your slaughter [[H2873]] have come; [[H4390]] you will fall [[H5307]] and be shattered [[H8600]] like fine [[H2532]] pottery. [[H3627]] 
35 Flight [[H4498]] will evade [[H6]] the shepherds, [[H7462]] and escape [will elude] [[H6413]] the leaders [[H117]] of the flock. [[H6629]] 
36 Hear the [[H6963]] cry [[H6818]] of the shepherds, [[H7462]] the wailing [[H3215]] of the leaders [[H117]] of the flock, [[H6629]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is destroying [[H7703]] their pasture. [[H4830]] 
37 The peaceful [[H7965]] meadows [[H4999]] will become lifeless [[H1826]] because of [[H6440]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] burning anger. [[H2740]] 
38 He has left [[H5800]] His den [[H5520]] like a lion, [[H3715]] for [[H3588]] their land [[H776]] has been made [[H1961]] a desolation [[H8047]] by [[H6440]] the sword [[H2740]] of the oppressor, [[H3238]] and because [[H6440]] of His fierce [[H2740]] anger. [[H639]]
