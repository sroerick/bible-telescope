# Jeremiah 17
[[Jeremiah 16|←]] • [[Jeremiah 18|→]]
1 The sin [[H2403]] of Judah [[H3063]] is written [[H3789]] with an iron [[H1270]] stylus, [[H5842]] engraved [[H2790]] with a diamond [[H8068]] point [[H6856]] on [[H5921]] the tablet [[H3871]] of their hearts [[H3820]] and on the horns [[H7161]] of their altars. [[H4196]] 
2 Even their children [[H1121]] remember [[H2142]] their altars [[H4196]] and Asherah poles, [[H842]] by [[H5921]] the green [[H7488]] trees, [[H6086]] on [[H5921]] the high [[H1364]] hills. [[H1389]] 
3 O My mountain [[H2042]] in the countryside, [[H7704]] I will give over [[H5414]] your wealth [[H2428]] and all [[H3605]] your treasures [[H214]] as plunder, [[H957]] because of the sin [[H2403]] of your high places, [[H1116]] in all [[H3605]] your borders. [[H1366]] 
4 And you yourself will relinquish [[H8058]] the inheritance [[H5159]] that [[H834]] I gave you. [[H5414]] I will enslave you [[H5647]] to your enemies [[H341]] in a land [[H776]] you do not [[H3808]] know, [[H3045]] for [[H3588]] you have kindled [[H784]] My anger; [[H639]] it will burn [[H3344]] forever. [[H5704]] 
5 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Cursed is [[H779]] the man [[H1397]] who [[H834]] trusts [[H982]] in mankind, [[H120]] who makes [[H7760]] the flesh [[H1320]] his strength [[H2220]] and turns [[H5493]] his heart [[H3820]] from [[H4480]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
6 He will be [[H1961]] like a shrub [[H6176]] in the desert; [[H6160]] he will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] when [[H3588]] prosperity [[H2896]] comes. [[H935]] He will dwell [[H7931]] in the parched places [[H2788]] of the desert, [[H4057]] in a salt [[H4420]] land [[H776]] where no [[H3808]] one lives. [[H3427]] 
7 But blessed [[H1288]] [is] the man [[H1397]] who [[H834]] trusts [[H982]] in the LORD, [[H3068]] whose confidence [[H4009]] is [[H1961]] [Him]. [[H3068]] 
8 He will be [[H1961]] like a tree [[H6086]] planted [[H8362]] by [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] that sends out its roots [[H8328]] toward [[H5921]] the stream. [[H3105]] It does not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] when [[H3588]] the heat [[H2527]] comes, [[H935]] and its leaves [[H5929]] are always [[H1961]] green. [[H7488]] It will not [[H3808]] worry [[H1672]] in a year [[H8141]] of drought [[H1226]] or cease [[H4185]] producing [[H6213]] fruit. [[H6529]] 
9 The heart [[H3820]] [is] deceitful [[H6121]] above all things [[H3605]] and beyond cure— [[H605]] who [[H4310]] can understand it? [[H3045]] 
10 I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] search [[H2713]] the heart; [[H3820]] I test [[H974]] the mind [[H3629]] to reward [[H5414]] a man [[H376]] according to his way, [[H1870]] by what his deeds [[H4611]] deserve. [[H6529]] 
11 Like a partridge [[H7124]] hatching eggs [[H1716]] it did not [[H3808]] lay [[H3205]] is the man who makes [[H6213]] a fortune [[H6239]] unjustly. [[H4941]] In the middle [[H2677]] of his days [[H3117]] his riches will desert him, [[H5800]] and in the end [[H319]] he will be [[H1961]] the fool. [[H5036]] 
12 A glorious [[H3519]] throne, [[H3678]] exalted [[H4791]] from the beginning, [[H7223]] is the place [[H4725]] of our sanctuary. [[H4720]] 
13 O LORD, [[H3068]] the hope [[H4723]] of Israel, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] who abandon You [[H5800]] will be put to shame. [[H954]] All who turn away [[H3249]] will be written [[H3789]] in the dust, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] they have abandoned [[H5800]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the fountain [[H4726]] of living [[H2416]] water. [[H4325]] 
14 Heal me, [[H7495]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and I will be healed; [[H7495]] save me, [[H3467]] and I will be saved, [[H3467]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are my praise. [[H8416]] 
15 Behold, [[H2009]] they [[H1992]] keep saying [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Where [[H346]] is the word [[H1697]] of the LORD? [[H3068]] Let it come [[H935]] now!” [[H4994]] 
16 But I [[H589]] have not [[H3808]] run away [[H213]] from being Your shepherd; [[H7462]] I have not [[H3808]] desired [[H183]] the day [[H3117]] of despair. [[H605]] You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] that the utterance [[H4161]] of my lips [[H8193]] was [spoken] [[H1961]] in [[H5227]] Your presence. [[H6440]] 
17 Do not [[H408]] become [[H1961]] a terror [[H4288]] to me;  You [[H859]] are my refuge [[H4268]] in the day [[H3117]] of disaster. [[H7451]] 
18 Let my persecutors [[H7291]] be put to shame, [[H954]] but do not [[H408]] let me [[H589]] be put to shame. [[H954]] Let them [[H1992]] be terrified, [[H2865]] but do not [[H408]] let me [[H589]] be terrified. [[H2865]] Bring [[H935]] upon them [[H5921]] the day [[H3117]] of disaster [[H7451]] and shatter them [[H7665]] with double [[H4932]] destruction. [[H7670]] 
19 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Go [[H1980]] and stand [[H5975]] at the gate [[H8179]] of the people, [[H1121]] through which [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] go in [[H935]] and out; [[H3318]] and [stand]  at all [the other] [[H3605]] gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
20 Say [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] ‘Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] O kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] all [people] [[H3605]] of Judah [[H3063]] [and] [[H3605]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] who enter [[H935]] through these [[H428]] gates. [[H8179]] 
21 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Take heed [[H8104]] for yourselves; [[H5315]] do not [[H408]] carry [[H5375]] a load [[H4853]] [or] bring it [[H935]] through the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]] 
22 You must not [[H3808]] carry a load [[H4853]] out [[H3318]] of your houses [[H1004]] or do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] work [[H4399]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] but you must keep [[H6942]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] day {holy}, [[H3117]] just as [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] your forefathers. [[H1]] 
23 Yet they would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] or incline [[H5186]] their ear, [[H241]] but they stiffened [[H7185]] their necks [[H6203]] and would not [[H1115]] listen [[H8085]] or receive [[H3947]] My discipline. [[H4148]] 
24 If, [[H518]] however, [[H1961]] you listen carefully [[H8085]] to Me, [[H413]] says [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and bring [[H935]] no [[H1115]] load [[H4853]] through the gates [[H8179]] of this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] and keep [[H6942]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] day {holy}, [[H3117]] and do [[H6213]] no [[H1115]] work on it, [[H4399]] 
25 then kings [[H4428]] and princes [[H8269]] will enter [[H935]] through the gates [[H8179]] of this [[H2063]] city. [[H5892]] They [[H1992]] will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David, [[H1732]] riding [[H7392]] in chariots [[H7393]] and on horses [[H5483]] with their officials, [[H8269]] along with the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will be inhabited [[H3427]] forever. [[H5769]] 
26 And people will come [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the places around [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] from the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] and from [[H4480]] the foothills, [[H8219]] the hill country, [[H2022]] and [[H4480]] the Negev, [[H5045]] bringing [[H935]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sacrifices, [[H2077]] grain offerings [[H4503]] and incense, [[H3828]] and thank offerings [[H8426]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
27 But if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to Me [[H413]] to keep [[H6942]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] day {holy} [[H3117]] by not [[H1115]] carrying [[H5375]] a load [[H4853]] while entering [[H935]] the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] then I will kindle [[H3341]] an unquenchable [[H3518]] fire [[H784]] in its gates [[H8179]] to consume [[H398]] the citadels [[H759]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
