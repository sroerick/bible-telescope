# Jeremiah 19
[[Jeremiah 18|←]] • [[Jeremiah 20|→]]
1 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] buy [[H7069]] a clay [[H2789]] jar [[H1228]] from a potter. [[H3335]] Take some of the elders [[H2205]] of the people [[H5971]] and leaders [[H2205]] of the priests, [[H3548]] 
2 and go [[H3318]] out to [[H413]] the valley [[H1516]] of Ben-hinnom [[H1121]] near the entrance [[H6607]] of the Potsherd [[H2777]] Gate. [[H8179]] Proclaim [[H7121]] there [[H8033]] the words [[H1697]] I speak [[H1696]] to you, [[H413]] 
3 saying, [[H559]] ‘Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] O kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] I am going to bring [[H935]] such disaster [[H7451]] on [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] that [[H834]] the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] who hear of it [[H8085]] will ring, [[H6750]] 
4 because [[H3282]] they have abandoned Me [[H5800]] and made this [[H2088]] a foreign [[H5234]] place. [[H4725]] They have burned incense [[H6999]] in it  to other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] that [[H834]] [neither] they [[H1992]] nor their fathers [[H1]] nor the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] have [ever] [[H3808]] known. [[H3045]] They have filled [[H4390]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] with the blood [[H1818]] of the innocent. [[H5355]] 
5 They have built [[H1129]] high places [[H1116]] to Baal [[H1168]] on which to burn [[H8313]] their children [[H1121]] in the fire [[H784]] as offerings [[H5930]] to Baal— [[H1168]] something [[H834]] I never [[H3808]] commanded [[H6680]] or mentioned, [[H1696]] nor [[H3808]] did it [ever] enter [[H5927]] My mind. [[H3820]] 
6 So [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be called [[H7121]] Topheth [[H8612]] or the valley [[H1516]] of Ben-hinnom, [[H1121]] but [[H3588]] the Valley [[H1516]] of Slaughter. [[H2028]] 
7 And in this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] I will ruin [[H1238]] the plans [[H6098]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]] I will make them fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] before [[H6440]] their enemies, [[H341]] by the hands [[H3027]] of those who seek [[H1245]] their lives, [[H5315]] and I will give [[H5414]] their carcasses [[H5038]] as food [[H3978]] to the birds [[H5775]] of the sky [[H8064]] and the beasts [[H929]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
8 I will make [[H7760]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] a desolation [[H8047]] and an [object of] scorn. [[H8322]] All [[H3605]] who pass [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] will be horrified, [[H8074]] and will scoff [[H8319]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] its wounds. [[H4347]] 
9 I will make them eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of their sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] and they will eat [[H398]] one [[H376]] another’s [[H7453]] flesh [[H1320]] in the siege [[H4692]] and distress [[H4689]] inflicted [[H6693]] on them  by their enemies [[H341]] who seek [[H1245]] their lives.’ [[H5315]] 
10 Then you are to shatter [[H7665]] the jar [[H1228]] in the presence [[H5869]] of the men [[H582]] who accompany [[H1980]] you, [[H854]] 
11 and you are to proclaim [[H559]] to them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] I will shatter [[H7665]] this [[H2088]] nation [[H5971]] and this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] like [[H834]] one shatters [[H7665]] a potter’s [[H3335]] jar [[H3627]] that [[H834]] can [[H3201]] never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] be repaired. [[H7495]] They will bury [[H6912]] the dead in Topheth [[H8612]] since there is nowhere [[H369]] else [[H4725]] to bury [them]. [[H6912]] 
12 This is what [[H3651]] I will do [[H6213]] to this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and to its residents, [[H3427]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] I will make [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] like Topheth. [[H8612]] 
13 The houses [[H1004]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and the houses [[H1004]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] will be [[H1961]] defiled [[H2931]] like that place, [[H4725]] Topheth— [[H8612]] all [[H3605]] the houses [[H1004]] on [[H5921]] whose rooftops [[H1406]] they burned incense [[H6999]] to all the [[H3605]] heavenly [[H8064]] hosts [[H6635]] and poured out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] to other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]] 
14 Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] returned [[H935]] from Topheth, [[H8612]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had sent [[H7971]] him to prophesy, [[H5012]] and he stood [[H5975]] in the court [[H2691]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] house [[H1004]] and proclaimed [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] 
15 “Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel: [[H3478]] ‘I am about to bring [[H935]] on [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] and on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the villages around it [[H5892]] every [[H3605]] disaster [[H7451]] I have pronounced [[H1696]] against them, [[H5921]] because [[H3588]] they have stiffened [[H7185]] their necks [[H6203]] so as not [[H1115]] to heed [[H8085]] My words.
