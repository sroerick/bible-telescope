# Jeremiah 30
[[Jeremiah 29|←]] • [[Jeremiah 31|→]]
1 This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the LORD: [[H3068]] 
2 “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Write [[H3789]] in a book [[H5612]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] to you. [[H413]] 
3 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when I will restore [[H7725]] from captivity [[H7622]] My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] declares [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] I will restore them [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] I gave [[H5414]] to their forefathers, [[H1]] and they will possess it.’” [[H3423]] 
4 These [[H428]] are the words [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] concerning [[H413]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah. [[H3063]] 
5 Yes, [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “We have heard [[H8085]] a cry [[H6963]] of panic— [[H2731]] of terror, [[H6343]] not [[H369]] of peace. [[H7965]] 
6 Ask [[H7592]] and see: [[H7200]] Can [[H518]] a male [[H2145]] give birth? [[H3205]] Why then [[H4069]] do I see [[H7200]] every [[H3605]] man [[H1397]] with his hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] his stomach [[H2504]] like a woman in labor [[H3205]] and every [[H3605]] face [[H6440]] turned [[H2015]] pale? [[H3420]] 
7 How [[H3588]] awful [[H1945]] that [[H1931]] day will be! [[H3117]] None will be [[H369]] like it! [[H3644]] It is [[H1931]] the time [[H6256]] of Jacob’s [[H3290]] distress, [[H6869]] but he will be delivered [[H3467]] out of it. [[H4480]] 
8 On that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] I will break [[H7665]] the yoke [[H5923]] off [[H5921]] their necks [[H6677]] and tear off [[H5423]] their bonds, [[H4147]] and no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] will strangers [[H2114]] enslave them. [[H5647]] 
9 Instead, they will serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3069]] their God [[H430]] and [[H853]] David [[H1732]] their king, [[H4428]] whom [[H834]] I will raise up [[H6965]] for them. [[H1992]] 
10 As for you, [[H859]] My servant [[H5650]] Jacob, [[H3290]] do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and do not [[H408]] be dismayed, [[H2865]] O Israel; [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] I will surely deliver you [[H3467]] out of a distant place, [[H7350]] your descendants [[H2233]] from the land [[H776]] of their captivity! [[H7628]] Jacob [[H3290]] will return [[H7725]] to quiet [[H8252]] and ease, [[H7599]] with no [[H369]] one to frighten him. [[H2729]] 
11 For [[H3588]] I [am] [[H589]] with you [[H854]] to save you, [[H3467]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Though [[H3588]] I will completely [[H6213]] destroy [[H3617]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] I have scattered you, [[H6327]] I will not [[H3808]] completely destroy you; [[H6213]] yet I will correct you [[H3256]] in measure, [[H4941]] and I will by no means [[H3808]] leave you unpunished.” [[H5352]] 
12 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Your injury [[H7667]] is incurable; [[H605]] your wound [[H4347]] [is] grievous. [[H2470]] 
13 [There is] no one [[H369]] to plead your cause, [[H1777]] no [[H1779]] remedy [[H7499]] for your sores, [[H4205]] no [[H369]] recovery [[H8585]] for you.  
14 All [[H3605]] your lovers [[H157]] have forgotten [[H7911]] you; [[H853]] they no longer [[H3808]] seek you, [[H1875]] for [[H3588]] I have struck you [[H5221]] as an enemy would, [[H341]] with the discipline [[H4148]] of someone cruel, [[H394]] because of [[H5921]] your great [[H7230]] iniquity [[H5771]] and numerous [[H6105]] sins. [[H2403]] 
15 Why [[H4100]] do you cry out [[H2199]] over [[H5921]] your wound? [[H7667]] Your pain [[H4341]] has no cure! [[H605]] Because of [[H5921]] your great [[H7230]] iniquity [[H5771]] and numerous [[H6105]] sins [[H2403]] I have done [[H6213]] these things [[H428]] to you.  
16 Nevertheless, [[H3651]] all [[H3605]] who devour you [[H398]] will be devoured, [[H398]] and all [[H3605]] your adversaries— [[H6862]] every one of them— [[H3605]] will go off [[H1980]] into exile. [[H7628]] Those who plundered you [[H7601]] will be plundered, [[H1961]] and all [[H3605]] who raided you [[H962]] will be raided. [[H5414]] 
17 But [[H3588]] I will restore [[H5927]] your health [[H724]] and heal [[H7495]] your wounds, [[H4347]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] they call [[H7121]] you  an outcast, [[H5080]] Zion, [[H6726]] for whom [[H1931]] no one [[H369]] cares.” [[H1875]] 
18 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “I will restore [[H7725]] the fortunes [[H7622]] of Jacob’s [[H3290]] tents [[H168]] and have compassion [[H7355]] on his dwellings. [[H4908]] And the city [[H5892]] will be rebuilt [[H1129]] on her [[H5921]] own ruins, [[H8510]] and the palace [[H759]] will stand [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] its rightful place. [[H4941]] 
19 Thanksgiving [[H8426]] will proceed [[H3318]] from them, [[H1992]] a sound [[H6963]] of celebration. [[H7832]] I will multiply them, [[H7235]] and they will not [[H3808]] be decreased; [[H4591]] I will honor them, [[H3513]] and they will not [[H3808]] be belittled. [[H6819]] 
20 Their children [[H1121]] will be [[H1961]] as in days of old, [[H6924]] and their congregation [[H5712]] will be established [[H3559]] before Me. [[H6440]] And I will punish [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] their oppressors. [[H3905]] 
21 Their leader [[H117]] will be [[H1961]] one of their own, [[H4480]] and their ruler [[H4910]] will arise [[H3318]] from their midst. [[H7130]] And I will bring him near, [[H7126]] and he will approach [[H5066]] Me, [[H413]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] would dare [[H6148]] on his own [[H3820]] to approach Me? [[H5066]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
22 And you will be [[H1961]] My people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] your God.” [[H430]] 
23 Behold, [[H2009]] the tempest [[H5591]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] wrath [[H2534]] has gone forth— [[H3318]] a churning [[H1641]] storm! [[H5591]] It will swirl [[H2342]] about [[H5921]] the heads [[H7218]] of the wicked. [[H7563]] 
24 The fierce anger [[H2740]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] turn back [[H7725]] until [[H5704]] He has fully accomplished [[H6213]] the purposes [[H4209]] of His heart. [[H3820]] In the days [[H3117]] to come [[H319]] you will understand this. [[H995]]
