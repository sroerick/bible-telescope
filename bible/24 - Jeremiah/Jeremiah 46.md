# Jeremiah 46
[[Jeremiah 45|←]] • [[Jeremiah 47|→]]
1 [This is] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] concerning [[H5921]] the nations. [[H1471]] 
2 To Egypt, [[H4714]] concerning the army [[H2428]] of Pharaoh Neco [[H6549]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] which [[H834]] was defeated [[H5221]] at Carchemish [[H3751]] on [[H5921]] the Euphrates [[H6578]] River [[H5104]] by Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] 
3 “Deploy [[H6186]] your shields, small [[H4043]] and large, [[H6793]] and advance [[H5066]] for battle! [[H4421]] 
4 Harness [[H631]] the horses; [[H5483]] mount [[H5927]] the steeds; [[H6571]] take your positions [[H3320]] with helmets on! [[H3553]] Polish [[H4838]] your spears; [[H7420]] put on [[H3847]] armor! [[H5630]] 
5 Why [[H4069]] am I seeing this? [[H7200]] They [[H1992]] are terrified, [[H2844]] they are retreating, [[H5472]] their warriors [[H1368]] are defeated, [[H3807]] they flee [[H4498]] in haste, [[H5127]] they never [[H3808]] look back, [[H6437]] terror [[H4032]] is on every side! [[H5439]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
6 The swift [[H7031]] cannot [[H408]] flee, [[H5127]] and the warrior [[H1368]] cannot [[H408]] escape! [[H4422]] In the north [[H6828]] by [[H5921]] the River [[H5104]] Euphrates [[H6578]] they stumble [[H3782]] and fall. [[H5307]] 
7 Who [[H4310]] is this, [[H2088]] rising [[H5927]] like the Nile, [[H2975]] like rivers [[H5104]] whose waters [[H4325]] churn? [[H1607]] 
8 Egypt [[H4714]] rises [[H5927]] like the Nile, [[H2975]] and its waters [[H4325]] churn [[H1607]] like rivers, [[H5104]] boasting, [[H559]] “I will rise [[H5927]] and cover [[H3680]] the earth; [[H776]] I will destroy [[H6]] the cities [[H5892]] and their people.” [[H3427]] 
9 Advance, [[H5927]] O horses! [[H5483]] Race furiously, [[H1984]] O chariots! [[H7393]] Let the warriors [[H1368]] come forth— [[H3318]] Cush [[H3568]] and Put [[H6316]] carrying [[H8610]] their shields, [[H4043]] men of Lydia [[H3866]] drawing [[H1869]] the bow. [[H7198]] 
10 That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] belongs to the Lord, [[H136]] the GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] a day [[H3117]] of vengeance [[H5360]] to avenge Himself [[H5358]] against His foes. [[H6862]] The sword [[H2719]] will devour [[H398]] until it is satisfied, [[H7646]] until it is quenched [[H7301]] with their blood. [[H1818]] For [[H3588]] it will be a sacrifice [[H2077]] to the Lord, [[H136]] the GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] in the land [[H776]] of the north [[H6828]] by [[H413]] the River [[H5104]] Euphrates. [[H6578]] 
11 Go up [[H5927]] to Gilead [[H1568]] [for] [[H3947]] balm, [[H6875]] O Virgin [[H1330]] Daughter [[H1323]] of Egypt! [[H4714]] In vain [[H7723]] you multiply [[H7235]] remedies; [[H7499]] there is no [[H369]] healing for you. [[H8585]] 
12 The nations [[H1471]] have heard [[H8085]] of your shame, [[H7036]] and your outcry [[H6682]] fills [[H4390]] the earth, [[H776]] because [[H3588]] warrior [[H1368]] stumbles [[H3782]] over warrior [[H1368]] and both [[H8147]] of them have fallen [[H5307]] together.” [[H3162]] 
13 This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] about the coming [[H935]] of Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] to strike [[H5221]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] 
14 “Announce it [[H5046]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and proclaim [[H8085]] it in Migdol; [[H4024]] proclaim [[H8085]] it in Memphis [[H5297]] and Tahpanhes: [[H8471]] ‘Take your positions [[H3320]] and prepare [[H3559]] yourself,  for [[H3588]] the sword [[H2719]] devours [[H398]] those around you.’ [[H5439]] 
15 Why [[H4069]] have your warriors [[H47]] been laid low? [[H5502]] They cannot [[H3808]] stand, [[H5975]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has thrust them down. [[H1920]] 
16 They continue [[H7235]] to stumble. [[H3782]] Indeed, [[H1571]] [they] [[H376]] have fallen [[H5307]] over [[H413]] one another. [[H7453]] They say, [[H559]] ‘Get up! [[H6965]] Let us return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] our people [[H5971]] and to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of our birth, [[H4138]] away from [[H6440]] the sword [[H2719]] of the oppressor.’ [[H3238]] 
17 There [[H8033]] they will proclaim, [[H7121]] ‘Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] was all noise; [[H7588]] he has let the appointed time [[H4150]] pass him by.’ [[H5674]] 
18 As surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the King, [[H4428]] whose name [[H8034]] is the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] will come one [[H935]] like Tabor [[H8396]] among the mountains [[H2022]] and like Carmel [[H3760]] by the sea. [[H3220]] 
19 Pack [[H6213]] your bags [[H3627]] for exile, [[H1473]] O daughter [[H1323]] dwelling [[H3427]] in Egypt! [[H4714]] For [[H3588]] Memphis [[H5297]] will be [[H1961]] laid waste, [[H8047]] destroyed [[H3341]] and uninhabited. [[H3427]] 
20 Egypt [[H4714]] is a beautiful [[H3304]] heifer, [[H5697]] but a gadfly [[H7171]] from the north [[H6828]] is coming against her. [[H935]] 
21 Even [[H1571]] the mercenaries [[H7916]] among her [[H7130]] are like fattened [[H4770]] calves. [[H5695]] They [[H1992]] too [[H1571]] will turn back; [[H6437]] together [[H3162]] they will flee; [[H5127]] they will not [[H3808]] stand their ground, [[H5975]] for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of their calamity [[H343]] is coming [[H935]] upon them— [[H5921]] the time [[H6256]] of their punishment. [[H6486]] 
22 Egypt will hiss [[H6963]] like a slithering [[H1980]] snake, [[H5175]] for [[H3588]] the enemy will advance [[H1980]] in force; [[H2428]] with axes [[H7134]] they will come [[H935]] against her  like woodsmen cutting down trees. [[H2404]] 
23 They will chop down [[H3772]] her forest, [[H3293]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] dense [[H3808]] though [[H3588]] it may be, [[H2713]] for [[H3588]] they are more numerous [[H7231]] than locusts; [[H697]] they cannot [[H369]] be counted. [[H4557]] 
24 The Daughter [[H1323]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will be put to shame, [[H3001]] handed over to [[H5414]] the people [[H5971]] of the north.” [[H6828]] 
25 The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] I am about to punish [[H6485]] Amon [[H527]] god of Thebes, [[H4996]] along with Pharaoh, [[H6547]] Egypt [[H4714]] and [[H5921]] her gods [[H430]] and kings, [[H4428]] and those who trust [[H982]] in Pharaoh. [[H6547]] 
26 I will hand them over to [[H5414]] those who seek [[H1245]] their lives— [[H5315]] to Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and his officers. [[H5650]] But after [[H310]] this, [[H3651]] [Egypt] will be inhabited [[H7931]] again as in ancient [[H6924]] times, [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
27 But you, [[H859]] O Jacob [[H3290]] My servant, [[H5650]] do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] and do not [[H408]] be dismayed, [[H2865]] O Israel, [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] surely [[H2005]] I will save you [[H3467]] from a distant place, [[H7350]] and [[H853]] your descendants [[H2233]] from the land [[H776]] of their captivity! [[H7628]] Jacob [[H3290]] will return [[H7725]] and be undisturbed [[H8252]] and secure, [[H7599]] with no [[H369]] one to make him afraid. [[H2729]] 
28 And you, [[H859]] My servant [[H5650]] Jacob, [[H3290]] do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will be with you. [[H854]] I will bring [[H6213]] destruction [[H3617]] on all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] I have banished you, [[H5080]] but I will not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] a full end [of you]. [[H3617]] I will discipline you, [[H3256]] but with justice; [[H4941]] I will by no means [[H3808]] leave you unpunished. [[H5352]]
