# Jeremiah 49
[[Jeremiah 48|←]] • [[Jeremiah 50|→]]
1 Concerning the Ammonites, [[H1121]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Has Israel [[H3478]] no [[H369]] sons? [[H1121]] Is he without [[H369]] heir? [[H3423]] Why then [[H4069]] has Molech [[H4428]] taken possession [[H3423]] of Gad [[H1410]] and his people [[H5971]] settled [[H3427]] in their cities? [[H5892]] 
2 Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when I will sound [[H8085]] the battle [[H4421]] cry [[H8643]] against [[H413]] Rabbah [[H7237]] of the Ammonites. [[H1121]] It will become [[H1961]] a heap [[H8510]] of ruins, [[H8077]] and its villages [[H1323]] will be burned. [[H3341]] Then Israel [[H3478]] will drive out [[H3423]] their dispossessors, [[H3423]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 Wail, [[H3213]] O Heshbon, [[H2809]] for [[H3588]] Ai [[H5857]] has been destroyed; [[H7703]] cry out, [[H6817]] O daughters [[H1323]] of Rabbah! [[H7237]] Put on [[H2296]] sackcloth [[H8242]] and mourn; [[H5594]] run back and forth [[H7751]] within your walls, [[H1448]] for [[H3588]] Molech [[H4428]] will go [[H1980]] into exile [[H1473]] together with [[H3162]] his priests [[H3548]] and officials. [[H8269]] 
4 Why [[H4100]] do you boast [[H1984]] of your valleys, [[H6010]] your valleys [[H6010]] so fruitful, [[H2100]] O faithless [[H7728]] daughter? [[H1323]] You trust [[H982]] in your riches [and say], [[H214]] ‘Who [[H4310]] can come against [[H935]] me?’ [[H413]] 
5 Behold, [[H2005]] I am about to bring [[H935]] terror [[H6343]] upon you, [[H5921]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] from all those [[H3605]] around you. [[H5439]] You will each be driven [[H5080]] headlong, [[H6440]] with no one [[H369]] to regather [[H6908]] the fugitives. [[H5074]] 
6 Yet afterward [[H310]] I will restore [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 Concerning Edom, [[H123]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Is there no [[H369]] longer [[H5750]] wisdom [[H2451]] in Teman? [[H8487]] Has counsel [[H6098]] perished [[H6]] from the prudent? [[H995]] Has their wisdom [[H2451]] decayed? [[H5628]] 
8 Turn [[H6437]] [and] run! [[H5127]] Lie [[H3427]] low, [[H6009]] O residents [[H3427]] of Dedan, [[H1719]] for [[H3588]] I will bring [[H935]] disaster [[H343]] on [[H5921]] Esau [[H6215]] at the time [[H6256]] I punish him. [[H6485]] 
9 If [[H518]] grape gatherers [[H1219]] came to you, [[H935]] would they not [[H3808]] leave [[H7604]] some gleanings? [[H5955]] Were thieves [[H1590]] to come in the night, [[H3915]] would they not steal [[H7843]] only what they wanted? [[H1767]] 
10 But [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will strip Esau [[H6215]] bare; [[H2834]] I will uncover [[H1540]] his hiding places, [[H4565]] and he will be unable [[H3808]] to conceal himself. [[H2247]] His descendants [[H2233]] will be destroyed [[H7703]] along with his relatives [[H251]] and neighbors, [[H7934]] and he will be no more. [[H369]] 
11 Abandon [[H5800]] your orphans; [[H3490]] I [[H589]] will preserve their lives. [[H2421]] Let your widows [[H490]] trust [[H982]] in Me.” [[H5921]] 
12 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “If [[H2009]] those who [[H834]] do not [[H369]] deserve [[H4941]] to drink [[H8354]] the cup [[H3563]] must drink it, [[H8354]] can you [[H859]] possibly remain unpunished? [[H5352]] You will not [[H3808]] go unpunished, [[H5352]] for [[H3588]] you must drink [[H8354]] it too. [[H8354]] 
13 For [[H3588]] by Myself I have sworn, [[H7650]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] Bozrah [[H1224]] will become [[H1961]] a desolation, [[H8047]] a disgrace, [[H2781]] a ruin, [[H2721]] and a curse, [[H7045]] and all [[H3605]] her cities [[H5892]] will be [[H1961]] in ruins [[H2723]] forever.” [[H5769]] 
14 I have heard [[H8085]] a message [[H8052]] from the LORD; [[H3068]] an envoy [[H6735]] has been sent [[H7971]] among the nations [[H1471]] [to say,] “Assemble yourselves [[H6908]] to come [[H935]] against her! [[H5921]] Rise up [[H6965]] for battle!” [[H4421]] 
15 “For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] I will make you [[H5414]] small [[H6996]] among the nations, [[H1471]] despised [[H959]] among men. [[H120]] 
16 The terror you cause [[H8606]] and the pride of your [[H2087]] heart [[H3820]] have deceived [[H5377]] you, [[H853]] O dwellers [[H7931]] in the clefts [[H2288]] of the rocks, [[H5553]] O occupiers [[H8610]] of the mountain [[H1389]] summit. [[H4791]] Though [[H3588]] you elevate [[H1361]] your nest [[H7064]] like the eagle, [[H5404]] even from there [[H8033]] I will bring you down,” [[H3381]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
17 “Edom [[H123]] will become [[H1961]] an object of horror. [[H8047]] Everyone [[H3605]] who passes [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] will be appalled [[H8074]] and will scoff [[H8319]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] its wounds. [[H4347]] 
18 As Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah [[H6017]] were overthrown [[H4114]] along with their neighbors,” [[H7934]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] will reside [[H3427]] there; [[H8033]] no [[H3808]] man [[H1121]] will dwell [[H1481]] there.  
19 Behold, [[H2009]] one will come up [[H5927]] like a lion [[H738]] from the thickets [[H1347]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] to [[H413]] the watered pasture. [[H5116]] Indeed, [[H3588]] I will chase [Edom] [[H7323]] from [its land] [[H5921]] in an instant. [[H7280]] Who [[H4310]] is the chosen one [[H970]] I will appoint [[H6485]] for this? [[H413]] For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] is like Me? [[H3644]] Who [[H4310]] will summon Me? [[H3259]] And what [[H4310]] shepherd [[H7462]] can stand [[H5975]] against Me? [[H6440]] 
20 Therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the plans [[H6098]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has made [[H3289]] against [[H413]] Edom [[H123]] and the strategies [[H4284]] He has devised [[H2803]] against [[H413]] the people [[H3427]] of Teman: [[H8487]] The little ones [[H6810]] of the flock [[H6629]] will surely [[H518]] be dragged away, [[H5498]] and their pasture [[H5116]] will be made desolate [[H8074]] because of them. [[H5921]] 
21 At the sound [[H6963]] of their fall, [[H5307]] the earth [[H776]] will quake; [[H7493]] their cry [[H6818]] will resound [[H8085]] to the Red [[H5488]] Sea. [[H3220]] 
22 Look! [[H2009]] An eagle [[H5404]] will soar, [[H5927]] then swoop down [[H1675]] and spread [[H6566]] its wings [[H3671]] over [[H5921]] Bozrah. [[H1224]] In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the hearts [[H3820]] of Edom’s [[H123]] warriors [[H1368]] will be [[H1961]] like the heart [[H3820]] of a woman [[H802]] in labor. [[H6887]] 
23 Concerning Damascus: [[H1834]] “Hamath [[H2574]] and Arpad [[H774]] are put to shame, [[H954]] for [[H3588]] they have heard [[H8085]] a bad [[H7451]] report; [[H8052]] they are agitated [[H4127]] like the sea; [[H3220]] their anxiety [[H1674]] cannot [[H3808]] be calmed. [[H8252]] 
24 Damascus [[H1834]] has become feeble; [[H7503]] she has turned [[H6437]] to flee. [[H5127]] Panic [[H7374]] has gripped her; [[H2388]] anguish [[H6869]] and pain [[H2256]] have seized her [[H270]] like a woman in labor. [[H3205]] 
25 How [[H349]] is the city [[H5892]] of praise [[H8416]] not [[H3808]] forsaken, [[H5800]] the town [[H7151]] that brings Me joy? [[H4885]] 
26 For [[H3651]] her young men [[H970]] will fall [[H5307]] in her streets; [[H7339]] all [[H3605]] the warriors [[H376]] will be silenced [[H1826]] in that [[H1931]] day.” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
27 “I will set fire [[H3341]] to the walls [[H2346]] of Damascus; [[H1834]] it will consume [[H398]] the fortresses [[H759]] of Ben-hadad.” [[H1130]] 
28 Concerning Kedar [[H6938]] and the kingdoms [[H4467]] of Hazor, [[H2674]] which [[H834]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] defeated, [[H5221]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Rise up, [[H6965]] advance [[H5927]] against [[H413]] Kedar, [[H6938]] and destroy [[H7703]] the people [[H1121]] of the east! [[H6924]] 
29 They will take [[H3947]] their tents [[H168]] and flocks, [[H6629]] their tent curtains [[H3407]] and all [[H3605]] their goods. [[H3627]] They will take [[H5375]] their camels for themselves. [[H1581]] They will shout [[H7121]] to them: [[H5921]] ‘Terror [[H4032]] is on every side!’ [[H5439]] 
30 Run! [[H5127]] Escape [[H5110]] quickly! [[H3966]] Lie [[H3427]] low, [[H6009]] O residents [[H3427]] of Hazor, [[H2674]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] has drawn up [[H3289]] a plan [[H6098]] against you; [[H5921]] he has devised [[H2803]] a strategy [[H4284]] against you. [[H5921]] 
31 Rise up, [[H6965]] advance [[H5927]] against [[H413]] a nation [[H1471]] at ease, [[H7961]] one that dwells [[H3427]] securely, [[H983]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] They have no [[H3808]] gates [[H1817]] or bars; [[H1280]] they live [[H7931]] alone. [[H910]] 
32 Their camels [[H1581]] will become [[H1961]] plunder, [[H957]] and their large [[H1995]] herds [[H4735]] will be spoil. [[H7998]] I will scatter [[H2219]] to the wind [[H7307]] in every direction [[H3605]] those who shave [[H7112]] their temples; [[H6285]] I will bring [[H935]] calamity on them [[H343]] from all [[H3605]] sides, [[H5676]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
33 Hazor [[H2674]] will become [[H1961]] a haunt [[H4583]] of jackals, [[H8577]] a desolation [[H8077]] forever. [[H5704]] No [[H3808]] one [[H376]] will reside [[H3427]] there; [[H8033]] no [[H3808]] man [[H1121]] will dwell [[H1481]] there.”  
34 This is the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] concerning [[H413]] Elam [[H5867]] at the beginning [[H7225]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
35 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] I will shatter [[H7665]] Elam’s [[H5867]] bow, [[H7198]] the mainstay [[H7225]] of their might. [[H1369]] 
36 I will bring [[H935]] the four [[H702]] winds [[H7307]] against [[H413]] Elam [[H5867]] from the four [[H702]] corners [[H7098]] of the heavens, [[H8064]] and I will scatter them [[H2219]] to all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] winds. [[H7307]] There will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] a nation [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] Elam’s [[H5867]] exiles [[H5080]] will not [[H3808]] go. [[H935]] 
37 So I will shatter [[H2865]] Elam [[H5867]] before [[H6440]] their foes, [[H341]] before [[H6440]] those who seek [[H1245]] their lives. [[H5315]] I will bring [[H935]] disaster [[H7451]] upon them, [[H5921]] even My fierce [[H2740]] anger, [[H639]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] I will send out [[H7971]] the sword [[H2719]] after them [[H310]] until [[H5704]] I finish them off. [[H3615]] 
38 I will set [[H7760]] My throne [[H3678]] in Elam, [[H5867]] and destroy [[H6]] its [[H8033]] king [[H4428]] and officials, [[H8269]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
39 Yet [[H1961]] in the last [[H319]] days, [[H3117]] I will restore [[H7725]] Elam [[H5867]] from captivity,” [[H7622]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
