# Jeremiah 5
[[Jeremiah 4|←]] • [[Jeremiah 6|→]]
1 Go up and down [[H7751]] the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Look [[H7200]] now [[H4994]] and take note; [[H3045]] search [[H1245]] her squares. [[H7339]] If [[H518]] you can find [[H4672]] a single person, [[H376]] [anyone] who acts [[H6213]] justly, [[H4941]] [anyone] who seeks [[H1245]] the truth, [[H530]] then I will forgive [the city]. [[H5545]] 
2 Although [[H518]] they say, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives,” [[H2416]] they are swearing falsely. [[H7650]] 
3 O LORD, [[H3068]] do not [[H3808]] Your eyes [look] [[H5869]] for truth? [[H530]] You struck them, [[H5221]] but they felt no [[H3808]] pain. [[H2342]] You finished them off, [[H3615]] but they refused [[H3985]] to accept [[H3947]] discipline. [[H4148]] They have made their faces [[H6440]] harder [[H2388]] than stone [[H5553]] and refused [[H3985]] to repent. [[H7725]] 
4 Then I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] “They [[H1992]] are only [[H389]] the poor; [[H1800]] they have played the fool, [[H2973]] for [[H3588]] they do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] the way [[H1870]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the justice [[H4941]] of their God. [[H430]] 
5 I will go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the powerful [[H1419]] and speak [[H1696]] to them. [[H853]] Surely [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] know [[H3045]] the way [[H1870]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the justice [[H4941]] of their God. [[H430]] But [[H389]] they too, [[H1992]] with one accord, [[H3162]] had broken [[H7665]] the yoke [[H5923]] and torn off [[H5423]] the chains. [[H4147]] 
6 Therefore [[H5921]] a lion [[H738]] from the forest [[H3293]] will strike them down, [[H5221]] a wolf [[H2061]] from the desert [[H6160]] will ravage them. [[H7703]] A leopard [[H5246]] will lie in wait [[H8245]] near [[H5921]] their cities, [[H5892]] [and] everyone [[H3605]] who ventures out [[H3318]] will be torn to pieces. [[H2963]] For [[H3588]] their rebellious acts [[H6588]] are many, [[H7231]] [and] their unfaithful deeds [[H4878]] are numerous. [[H6105]] 
7 “Why [[H335]] should I forgive you? [[H5545]] Your children [[H1121]] have forsaken Me [[H5800]] and sworn [[H7650]] by [gods] that are not [[H3808]] gods. [[H430]] I satisfied [[H7650]] their needs, [[H853]] yet they committed adultery [[H5003]] and assembled [[H1413]] at the houses [[H1004]] of prostitutes. [[H2181]] 
8 They are [[H1961]] well-fed, [[H2109]] lusty [[H7904]] stallions, [[H5483]] each [[H376]] neighing [[H6670]] after [[H413]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife. [[H802]] 
9 Should I not [[H3808]] punish [[H6485]] them for [[H5921]] these things?” [[H428]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Should I not [[H3808]] avenge [[H5358]] Myself [[H5315]] on such a nation [[H1471]] as this? [[H2088]] 
10 Go up [[H5927]] through her vineyards [[H8284]] and ravage them, [[H7843]] but do not [[H408]] finish them off. [[H3617]] Strip off [[H5493]] her branches, [[H5189]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] do not [[H3808]] belong to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 For [[H3588]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] have been utterly unfaithful [[H898]] to Me,”  declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 They have lied [[H3584]] about the LORD [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] “He [[H1931]] will not do anything; [[H3808]] harm [[H7451]] will not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] to us; [[H5921]] we will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] sword [[H2719]] or famine. [[H7458]] 
13 The prophets [[H5030]] are [[H1961]] but wind, [[H7307]] for the LORD’s word [[H1699]] is not in them. [[H369]] So let [their own words] [[H3541]] be done [[H6213]] to  them.”  
14 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H3068]] GOD [[H430]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Because [[H3282]] you have spoken [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] I will make [[H5414]] My words [[H1697]] a fire [[H784]] in your mouth [[H6310]] and this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] the wood [[H6086]] it will consume. [[H398]] 
15 Behold, [[H2005]] I am bringing [[H935]] a distant [[H4801]] nation [[H1471]] against you, [[H5921]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel,” [[H3478]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “It [[H1931]] is an established [[H386]] nation, [[H1471]] an ancient [[H5769]] nation, [[H1471]] a nation [[H1471]] whose language [[H3956]] you do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] and whose speech [[H4100]] you do not [[H3808]] understand. [[H8085]] 
16 Their quivers [[H827]] are like open [[H6605]] graves; [[H6913]] they are all [[H3605]] mighty warriors. [[H1368]] 
17 They will devour [[H398]] your harvest [[H7105]] and food; [[H3899]] they will consume [[H398]] your sons [[H1121]] and daughters; [[H1323]] they will eat up [[H398]] your flocks [[H6629]] and herds; [[H1241]] they will feed on [[H398]] your vines [[H1612]] and fig trees. [[H8384]] With the sword [[H2719]] they will destroy [[H7567]] the fortified [[H4013]] cities [[H5892]] in which [[H834]] you [[H859]] trust. [[H982]] 
18 Yet even [[H1571]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] I will not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] a full end [[H3617]] of you. [[H854]] 
19 And [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the people ask, [[H559]] ‘For [[H8478]] what [[H4100]] offense has the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these things to us?’ [[H428]] You are to tell [[H559]] them, [[H413]] ‘Just as [[H834]] you have forsaken [[H5800]] Me [[H853]] and served [[H5647]] foreign [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] in your land, [[H776]] so [[H3651]] will you serve [[H5647]] foreigners [[H2114]] in a land [[H776]] that is not your own.’ [[H3808]] 
20 Declare [[H5046]] this [[H2063]] in the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and proclaim [[H8085]] it in Judah: [[H3063]] 
21 Hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] O foolish [[H5530]] and senseless [[H369]] people, [[H5971]] who have eyes [[H5869]] but do not [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] who have ears [[H241]] but do not [[H3808]] hear. [[H8085]] 
22 Do you not [[H3808]] fear Me? [[H3372]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Do you not [[H3808]] tremble [[H2342]] before Me, [[H6440]] the One who [[H834]] set [[H7760]] the sand [[H2344]] as the boundary [[H1366]] of the sea, [[H3220]] an enduring [[H5769]] barrier [[H2706]] it cannot [[H3808]] cross? [[H5674]] The waves [[H1530]] surge, [[H1607]] but they cannot [[H3808]] prevail. [[H3201]] They roar [[H1993]] but cannot [[H3808]] cross it. [[H5674]] 
23 But these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] have [[H1961]] stubborn [[H5637]] and rebellious [[H4784]] hearts. [[H3820]] They have turned aside [[H5493]] and gone away. [[H1980]] 
24 They have not [[H3808]] said [[H559]] in their hearts, [[H3824]] ‘Let us fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] who gives [[H5414]] the rains, [[H1653]] both autumn [[H3138]] and spring, [[H4456]] in season, [[H6256]] who keeps [[H8104]] for us  the appointed [[H2708]] weeks [[H7620]] of harvest.’ [[H7105]] 
25 Your iniquities [[H5771]] have diverted [[H5186]] these from you; [[H428]] your sins [[H2403]] have deprived [[H4513]] you [[H4480]] of My bounty. [[H2896]] 
26 For [[H3588]] My people [[H5971]] are among [[H4672]] wicked men. [[H7563]] They watch [[H7789]] like fowlers [[H3353]] lying in wait; [[H7918]] they set [[H5324]] a trap; [[H4889]] they catch [[H3920]] men. [[H582]] 
27 Like cages [[H3619]] full of [[H4392]] birds, [[H5775]] so [[H3651]] their houses [[H1004]] are full of [[H4392]] deceit. [[H4820]] Therefore [[H5921]] they have become powerful [[H1431]] and rich. [[H6238]] 
28 They have grown fat [[H8080]] and sleek, [[H6245]] and [[H1571]] have excelled [[H5674]] in evil [[H7451]] matters. [[H1697]] They have not [[H3808]] taken up the cause [[H1779]] of the fatherless, [[H3490]] so they might prosper, [[H6743]] nor have they [[H3808]] defended [[H8199]] the rights [[H4941]] of the needy. [[H34]] 
29 Should I not [[H3808]] punish [[H6485]] them for [[H5921]] these things? [[H428]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Should I not [[H3808]] avenge [[H5358]] Myself [[H5315]] on such a nation [[H1471]] as this? [[H2088]] 
30 A horrible [[H8047]] and shocking thing [[H8186]] has happened [[H1961]] in the land. [[H776]] 
31 The prophets [[H5030]] prophesy [[H5012]] falsely, [[H8267]] and the priests [[H3548]] rule [[H7287]] by [[H5921]] their own authority. [[H3027]] My people [[H5971]] love [[H157]] it so, [[H3651]] but what [[H4100]] will you do [[H6213]] in the end?” [[H319]]
