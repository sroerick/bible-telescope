# Jeremiah 2
[[Jeremiah 1|←]] • [[Jeremiah 3|→]]
1 Now the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying: [[H559]] 
2 “Go [[H1980]] and proclaim [[H7121]] in the hearing [[H241]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] I remember [[H2142]] the devotion [[H2617]] of your youth, [[H5271]] your love [[H160]] as a bride, [[H3623]] how you followed [[H1980]] Me in the wilderness, [[H4057]] in a land [[H776]] not [[H3808]] sown. [[H2232]] 
3 Israel [[H3478]] was holy [[H6944]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the firstfruits [[H7225]] of His harvest. [[H8393]] All [[H3605]] who devoured her [[H398]] found themselves guilty; [[H816]] disaster [[H7451]] came [[H935]] upon them, [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
4 Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] O house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and all [[H3605]] you families [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
5 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] fault [[H5766]] did your fathers [[H1]] find in Me [[H4672]] that [[H3588]] they strayed so far [[H7368]] from Me, [[H5921]] and followed [[H1980]] worthless idols, [[H1892]] and became worthless themselves? [[H1891]] 
6 They did not [[H3808]] ask, [[H559]] ‘Where [[H346]] is the LORD [[H3068]] who brought [[H5927]] us from [[H853]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] who led [[H1980]] us through the wilderness, [[H4057]] through a land [[H776]] of deserts [[H6160]] and pits, [[H7745]] through a land [[H776]] of drought [[H6723]] and darkness, [[H6757]] a land [[H776]] where no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] travels [[H5674]] and [[H8033]] no [[H3808]] one [[H120]] lives? [[H3427]] 
7 I brought [[H935]] you [[H853]] into [[H413]] a fertile [[H3759]] land [[H776]] to eat [[H398]] its fruit [[H6529]] and bounty, [[H2898]] but you came [[H935]] and defiled [[H2930]] My land, [[H776]] and made [[H7760]] My inheritance [[H5159]] detestable. [[H8441]] 
8 The priests [[H3548]] did not [[H3808]] ask, [[H559]] ‘Where [[H346]] is the LORD?’ [[H3068]] The experts [[H8610]] in the law [[H8451]] no [[H3808]] longer knew Me, [[H3045]] and the leaders [[H7462]] rebelled [[H6586]] against Me.  The prophets [[H5030]] prophesied [[H5012]] by Baal [[H1168]] and followed [[H310]] useless [[H3808]] idols. [[H3276]] 
9 Therefore, [[H3651]] I will contend [[H7378]] with [[H854]] you again, [[H5750]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and I will bring a case [[H7378]] against [[H854]] your children’s [[H1121]] children. [[H1121]] 
10 Cross over [[H5674]] to Cyprus [[H3794]] and take a look; [[H7200]] send [[H7971]] to Kedar [[H6938]] and consider [[H995]] carefully; [[H3966]] see [[H7200]] if [[H2005]] there has ever been [[H1961]] anything like this: [[H2063]] 
11 Has a nation [[H1471]] ever changed [[H4171]] its gods? [[H430]] (though they [[H1992]] were no [[H3808]] gods [at all]!) [[H430]] Yet My people [[H5971]] have exchanged [[H4171]] their Glory [[H3519]] for idols [[H3276]] [that are] useless. [[H1094]] 
12 Be stunned [[H8074]] by [[H5921]] this, [[H2063]] O heavens, [[H8064]] be shocked [[H8175]] and utterly [[H3966]] appalled, [[H2717]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 “For [[H3588]] My people [[H5971]] have committed [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] evils: [[H7451]] They have forsaken Me, [[H5800]] the fountain [[H4726]] of living [[H2416]] water, [[H4325]] and they have dug [[H2672]] cisterns for themselves, [[H877]] broken [[H7665]] cisterns [[H877]] that [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] hold [[H3557]] water. [[H4325]] 
14 Is Israel [[H3478]] a slave? [[H5650]] Was he [[H1931]] born into slavery? [[H3211]] Why then [[H4069]] has he become [[H1961]] prey? [[H957]] 
15 The young lions [[H3715]] have roared [[H7580]] at him; [[H5921]] they have growled [[H5414]] with a loud voice. [[H6963]] They have laid [[H7896]] waste [[H8047]] his land; [[H776]] his cities [[H5892]] lie in ruins, [[H3341]] without [[H1097]] inhabitants. [[H3427]] 
16 The men [[H1121]] of Memphis [[H5297]] and Tahpanhes [[H8471]] have shaved [[H7462]] the crown of your head. [[H6936]] 
17 Have you not [[H3808]] brought [[H6213]] this on yourself [[H2063]] by forsaking [[H5800]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] when [[H6256]] He led you [[H1980]] in the way? [[H1870]] 
18 Now [[H6258]] what will you gain [[H4100]] on your way [[H1870]] to Egypt [[H4714]] to drink [[H8354]] the waters [[H4325]] of the Nile? [[H7883]] What will you gain [[H4100]] on your way [[H1870]] to Assyria [[H804]] to drink [[H8354]] the waters [[H4325]] of the Euphrates? [[H5104]] 
19 Your own evil [[H7451]] will discipline you; [[H3256]] your own apostasies [[H4878]] will reprimand you. [[H3198]] Consider [[H3045]] and realize [[H7200]] how [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] and bitter it is [[H4751]] for you to forsake [[H5800]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and to have [[H413]] no [[H3808]] fear of Me,” [[H6345]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
20 “For [[H3588]] long ago [[H5769]] you broke [[H7665]] your yoke [[H5923]] and tore off [[H5423]] your chains, [[H4147]] saying, [[H559]] “I will not [[H3808]] serve!” [[H5647]] Indeed, [[H3588]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] hill [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree [[H6086]] you [[H859]] lay down [[H6808]] as a prostitute. [[H2181]] 
21 I [[H595]] had planted you [[H5193]] like a choice [[H3605]] vine [[H8321]] from the very best [[H571]] seed. [[H2233]] How [[H349]] could you turn yourself [[H2015]] before me,  into a rotten [[H5494]] wild [[H5237]] vine? [[H1612]] 
22 Although [[H3588]] you wash [[H3526]] with lye [[H5427]] and use an abundance [[H7235]] of soap, [[H1287]] the stain [[H3799]] of your guilt [[H5771]] is still before Me,” [[H6440]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
23 “How [[H349]] can you say, [[H559]] ‘I am not [[H3808]] defiled; [[H2930]] I have not [[H3808]] run [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the Baals’? [[H1168]] Look [[H7200]] at your behavior [[H1870]] in the valley; [[H1516]] acknowledge [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] you have done. [[H6213]] You are a swift [[H7031]] young she-camel [[H1072]] galloping here and there, [[H8308]] 
24 a wild donkey [[H6501]] at home in [[H3928]] the wilderness, [[H4057]] sniffing [[H7602]] the wind [[H7307]] in the heat [[H8385]] of her [[H5315]] desire. [[H185]] Who [[H4310]] can restrain her passion? [[H7725]] All [[H3605]] who seek her [[H1245]] need not [[H3808]] weary themselves; [[H3286]] in mating season [[H2320]] they will find her. [[H4672]] 
25 Keep [[H4513]] your feet [[H7272]] from being unshod [[H3182]] and your throat [[H1637]] from thirst. [[H6773]] But you say, [[H559]] ‘It is hopeless! [[H2976]] I love [[H157]] foreign [gods], [[H2114]] and I must go after [[H310]] them.’ [[H1980]] 
26 As the thief [[H1590]] is ashamed [[H1322]] when [[H3588]] he is caught, [[H4672]] so [[H3651]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] is disgraced. [[H954]] They, [[H1992]] their kings, [[H4428]] their officials, [[H8269]] their priests, [[H3548]] and their prophets [[H5030]] 
27 say [[H559]] to a tree, [[H6086]] ‘You [[H859]] are my father,’ [[H1]] and to a stone, [[H68]] ‘You [[H859]] gave birth to me.’ [[H3205]] For [[H3588]] they have turned [[H6437]] their backs [[H6203]] to Me [[H413]] and not [[H3808]] their faces, [[H6440]] yet in the time [[H6256]] of trouble [[H7451]] they beg, [[H559]] ‘Rise up [[H6965]] and save us!’ [[H3467]] 
28 But where [[H346]] are the gods [[H430]] you made for yourself? [[H6213]] Let them rise up [[H6965]] and save you [[H3467]] if they can [[H518]] in your time [[H6256]] of trouble; [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] your gods [[H430]] are [[H1961]] as numerous [[H4557]] as your cities, [[H5892]] O Judah. [[H3063]] 
29 Why [[H4100]] do you bring a case [[H7378]] against Me? [[H413]] You have all [[H3605]] rebelled against Me,” [[H6586]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
30 “I have struck [[H5221]] your sons [[H1121]] in vain; [[H7723]] they accepted [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] discipline. [[H4148]] Your own sword [[H2719]] has devoured [[H398]] your prophets [[H5030]] like a voracious [[H7843]] lion. [[H738]] 
31 You [people] [[H859]] of this generation, [[H1755]] consider [[H7200]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] Have I been [[H1961]] a wilderness [[H4057]] to Israel [[H3478]] or [[H518]] a land [[H776]] of dense darkness? [[H3991]] Why [[H4069]] do My people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘We [are free to] roam; [[H7300]] we will [[H3808]] come [[H935]] to You [[H413]] no more’? [[H5750]] 
32 Does a maiden [[H1330]] forget [[H7911]] her jewelry [[H5716]] or a bride [[H3618]] her wedding sash? [[H7196]] Yet My people [[H5971]] have forgotten Me [[H7911]] for days [[H3117]] without [[H369]] number. [[H4557]] 
33 How [[H4100]] skillfully [[H3190]] you pursue [[H1245]] love; [[H160]] even [[H1571]] the most immoral of women [[H7451]] could learn [[H3925]] from your ways. [[H1870]] 
34 Moreover, [[H1571]] your skirts [[H3671]] are stained [[H4672]] with the blood [[H1818]] of the innocent [[H5355]] poor, [[H34]] though you did not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] them breaking in. [[H4290]] But [[H3588]] in spite of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] these things [[H428]] 
35 you say, [[H559]] ‘I am innocent. [[H5352]] Surely [[H389]] His anger [[H639]] will turn [[H7725]] from me.’ [[H4480]] But I will certainly [[H2005]] judge [[H8199]] you, [[H854]] because [[H5921]] you say, [[H559]] ‘I have not [[H3808]] sinned.’ [[H2398]] 
36 How [[H4100]] unstable you are, [[H235]] constantly [[H3966]] changing [[H8138]] your ways! [[H1870]] You will be disappointed [[H954]] by Egypt [[H4714]] just as [[H834]] you [were] [[H954]] by Assyria. [[H804]] 
37 Moreover, [[H1571]] you will leave [[H3318]] that place [[H2088]] with your hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] your head, [[H7218]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has rejected [[H3988]] those you trust; [[H4009]] you will not [[H3808]] prosper [[H6743]] by their help.”
