# Jeremiah 35
[[Jeremiah 34|←]] • [[Jeremiah 36|→]]
1 This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the LORD [[H3068]] in the days [[H3117]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] 
2 “Go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the Rechabites, [[H7397]] speak [[H1696]] to them, [[H853]] and bring [[H935]] them to [[H413]] one [[H259]] of the chambers [[H3957]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to offer them a drink [[H8248]] of wine.” [[H3196]] 
3 So I took [[H3947]] Jaazaniah [[H2970]] son [[H1121]] of Jeremiah, [[H3414]] the son [[H1121]] of Habazziniah, [[H2262]] and his brothers [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] his sons— [[H1121]] the entire [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of the Rechabites— [[H7397]] 
4 and I brought them into [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] to [[H413]] a chamber [[H3957]] occupied by the sons [[H1121]] of Hanan [[H2605]] son [[H1121]] of Igdaliah, [[H3012]] a man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] This [room was] [[H834]] near [[H681]] the chamber [[H3957]] of the officials, [[H8269]] which [[H834]] was above [[H4605]] the chamber [[H3957]] of Maaseiah [[H4641]] son [[H1121]] of Shallum [[H7967]] the doorkeeper. [[H8104]] 
5 Then I set [[H5414]] pitchers [[H1375]] full [[H4392]] of wine [[H3196]] and cups [[H3563]] before [[H6440]] the men [[H1121]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Rechabites [[H7397]] and said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Drink [[H8354]] some wine.” [[H3196]] 
6 “We do not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] wine,” [[H3196]] they replied, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] our forefather [[H1]] Jonadab [[H3122]] son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] commanded [[H6680]] us, [[H5921]] ‘Neither you [[H859]] nor your descendants [[H1121]] are ever to [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] wine. [[H3196]] 
7 Nor are you ever [[H3808]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] or sow [[H2232]] seed [[H2233]] or plant [[H5193]] a vineyard. [[H3754]] Those things are [[H1961]] not for you. [[H3808]] Instead, [[H3588]] you must live [[H3427]] in tents [[H168]] all [[H3605]] your lives, [[H3117]] so that [[H4616]] you may live [[H2421]] a long [[H7227]] time [[H3117]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] sojourn. [[H1481]] 
8 We have obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of our forefather [[H1]] Jonadab [[H3082]] son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] in all [[H3605]] he commanded us. [[H6680]] So we have not [[H1115]] drunk [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] all [[H3605]] our lives— [[H3117]] neither we [[H587]] [nor] our wives [[H802]] [nor] sons [[H1121]] [nor] daughters. [[H1323]] 
9 Nor have we [[H1115]] built [[H1129]] houses [[H1004]] to live in [[H3427]] [or] [[H3808]] had [[H1961]] vineyards, [[H3754]] fields, [[H7704]] or crops. [[H2233]] 
10 But we have lived [[H3427]] in tents [[H168]] and have obeyed [[H8085]] and done [[H6213]] exactly as [[H3605]] our forefather [[H1]] Jonadab [[H3122]] commanded us. [[H6680]] 
11 But when [[H1961]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] marched [[H5927]] into [[H413]] the land, [[H776]] we said: [[H559]] ‘Come, [[H935]] let us go into [[H935]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] to escape [[H6440]] the armies [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] and the Arameans. [[H758]] So we have remained [[H3427]] in Jerusalem.” [[H3389]] 
12 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah: [[H3414]] 
13 “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] ‘Will you not [[H3808]] accept [[H3947]] discipline [[H4148]] and obey [[H8085]] My words?’ [[H1697]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3069]] 
14 The words [[H1697]] of Jonadab [[H3082]] son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] have been carried out. [[H6965]] He [[H834]] commanded [[H6680]] his sons [[H1121]] not [[H1115]] to drink [[H8354]] wine, [[H3196]] and they have not [[H3808]] drunk [it] [[H8354]] to [[H5704]] this very [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] they have obeyed [[H8085]] the command [[H4687]] of their forefather. [[H1]] But I [[H595]] have spoken [[H1696]] to you [[H413]] again and again, [[H7925]] and you have not [[H3808]] obeyed Me! [[H8085]] 
15 Time and time again [[H7925]] I have sent [[H7971]] you all [[H3605]] My servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] proclaiming: [[H559]] ‘Turn [[H7725]] now, [[H4994]] each of you, [[H376]] from your wicked [[H7451]] ways, [[H1870]] and correct [[H3190]] your actions. [[H4611]] Do not [[H408]] go after [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve them. [[H5647]] Live [[H3427]] in [[H413]] the land [[H127]] that [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] to you  and your fathers. [[H1]] But you have not [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] your ear [[H241]] or listened [[H8085]] to Me. [[H413]] 
16 Yes, [[H3588]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jonadab [[H3082]] son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] carried out [[H6965]] the command [[H4687]] their forefather [[H1]] gave them, [[H6680]] but these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] have not [[H3808]] listened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Me.  
17 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] to [[H413]] Judah [[H3063]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] all [[H3605]] the disaster [[H7451]] I have pronounced [[H1696]] against them, [[H5921]] because [[H3282]] I have spoken [[H1696]] to them [[H413]] but they have not [[H3808]] obeyed, [[H8085]] and I have called to them [[H7121]] but they have not [[H3808]] answered. [[H6030]] 
18 Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] to the house [[H1004]] of the Rechabites: [[H7397]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you have obeyed [[H8085]] the command [[H4687]] of your forefather [[H1]] Jonadab [[H3082]] and have kept [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] his commandments [[H4687]] and have done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he charged you to do, [[H6680]] 
19 this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] Jonadab [[H3122]] son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] will never [[H3808]] fail to have [[H3772]] a man [[H376]] to stand [[H5975]] before Me.’” [[H6440]]
