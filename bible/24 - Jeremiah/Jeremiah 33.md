[[Jeremiah 32|←]] • [[Jeremiah 34|→]]
1 While [Jeremiah] [[H1931]] was still [[H5750]] confined [[H6113]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard, [[H4307]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] [him] [[H3414]] a second time: [[H8145]] 
2 “Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] who made the earth, [[H6213]] the LORD [[H3068]] who formed [[H3335]] it [[H853]] and established it, [[H3559]] the LORD [[H3068]] is His name: [[H8034]] 
3 Call [[H7121]] to Me [[H413]] and I will answer [[H6030]] and show [[H5046]] you  great [[H1419]] and unsearchable things [[H1219]] you do not [[H3808]] know. [[H3045]] 
4 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says [[H559]] about [[H5921]] the houses [[H1004]] of this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] and the palaces [[H1004]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] that have been torn down [[H5422]] for defense against [[H413]] the siege ramps [[H5550]] and the sword: [[H2719]] 
5 Those who come [[H935]] to fight [[H3898]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] will fill [[H4390]] [these houses] [[H854]] with [[H854]] the corpses [[H6297]] of their own men, [[H120]] whom [[H834]] I will strike down [[H5221]] in My anger [[H639]] and in My wrath. [[H2534]] I have hidden [[H5641]] My face [[H6440]] from this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] its wickedness. [[H7451]] 
6 Nevertheless, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H5927]] to it  health [[H724]] and healing, [[H4832]] and I will heal [its people] [[H7495]] and reveal [[H1540]] to them [[H1992]] the abundance [[H6283]] of peace [[H7965]] and truth. [[H571]] 
7 I will restore [[H7725]] Judah [[H3063]] and [[H7622]] Israel [[H3478]] from captivity [[H7622]] and will rebuild them [[H1129]] as in former times. [[H7223]] 
8 And I will cleanse them [[H2891]] from all [[H3605]] the iniquity [[H5771]] they have committed against Me [[H2398]] and forgive [[H5545]] all [[H3605]] the wrongs [[H834]] they have committed [[H2398]] by rebelling against Me. [[H6586]] 
9 So [this city] will bring [[H1961]] Me  renown, [[H8034]] joy, [[H8342]] praise, [[H8416]] and glory [[H8597]] before all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth, [[H776]] who [[H834]] will hear [[H8085]] of all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] I [[H595]] do [[H6213]] for it. [[H853]] They will tremble [[H7264]] in awe [[H6342]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the goodness [[H2896]] and [[H3605]] prosperity [[H7965]] I [[H595]] will provide it. [[H6213]] 
10 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] In this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] you [[H859]] say [[H559]] is a wasteland [[H2720]] without [[H369]] man [[H120]] [or] [[H369]] beast, [[H929]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] that are deserted— [[H8074]] inhabited [[H3427]] by neither [[H369]] man [[H120]] nor [[H369]] beast— [[H929]] there will be heard [[H8085]] again [[H5750]] 
11 the sounds [[H6963]] of joy [[H8342]] [and] [[H6963]] gladness, [[H8057]] the voices [[H6963]] of the bride [[H3618]] [and] [[H6963]] bridegroom, [[H2860]] and the voices [[H6963]] of those bringing [[H935]] thank offerings [[H8426]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] saying: [[H559]] ‘Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is good; [[H2896]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever. [[H5769]] For [[H3588]] I will restore [[H7725]] the land [[H776]] from captivity [[H7622]] as in former times, [[H7223]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] In this [[H2088]] desolate [[H2720]] place, [[H4725]] without [[H369]] man [[H120]] or beast, [[H929]] and in all [[H3605]] its cities, [[H5892]] there will once more [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] pastures [[H5116]] for shepherds [[H7462]] to rest [[H7257]] [their] flocks. [[H6629]] 
13 In the cities [[H5892]] of the hill country, [[H2022]] the foothills, [[H8219]] [and] [[H5892]] the Negev, [[H5045]] in the land [[H776]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] and the cities surrounding [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the flocks [[H6629]] will again [[H5750]] pass [[H5674]] under [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of the one who counts them, [[H4487]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
14 Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when I will fulfill [[H6965]] the gracious [[H2896]] promise [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
15 In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] and at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I will cause to sprout [[H6779]] a Righteous [[H6666]] Branch [[H6780]] of David, [[H1732]] and He will administer [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6666]] in the land. [[H776]] 
16 In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] Judah [[H3063]] will be saved, [[H3467]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] will dwell securely, [[H7931]] and this [[H2088]] is the name [[H834]] by which she will be called: [[H7121]] The LORD [[H3068]] Our Righteousness. [[H6664]] 
17 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] David [[H1732]] will never [[H3808]] lack [[H3772]] a man [[H376]] to sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] 
18 nor [[H3808]] will the priests [[H3548]] who are Levites [[H3881]] ever [[H3605]] fail [[H3772]] to have a man [[H376]] before [[H6440]] Me to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] to burn [[H6999]] grain offerings, [[H4503]] and to present [[H6213]] sacrifices.” [[H2077]] 
19 And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah: [[H3414]] 
20 “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] If [[H518]] you can break [[H6565]] My covenant [[H1285]] with the day [[H3117]] and My covenant [[H1285]] with the night, [[H3915]] so that day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] cease [[H1115]] to occupy [[H1961]] their appointed time, [[H6256]] 
21 then My covenant [[H1285]] may also [[H1571]] be broken [[H6565]] with [[H854]] David [[H1732]] My servant [[H5650]] and with [[H854]] My ministers [[H8334]] the Levites [[H3881]] who are priests, [[H3548]] so that [David] will not have [[H1961]] a son [[H1121]] to reign [[H4427]] on [[H5921]] his throne. [[H3678]] 
22 As [[H834]] the hosts [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] cannot [[H3808]] be counted [[H5608]] [and] the sand [[H2344]] of the sea [[H3220]] cannot [[H3808]] be measured, [[H4058]] so too [[H3651]] will I multiply [[H7235]] the descendants [[H2233]] of My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] and the Levites [[H3881]] who minister [[H8334]] before Me.”  
23 Moreover, the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah: [[H3414]] 
24 “Have you not [[H3808]] noticed [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] are saying: [[H1696]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] has rejected [[H3988]] the two [[H8147]] families [[H4940]] He had chosen’? [[H977]] So they despise [[H5006]] My people [[H5971]] and no longer [[H5750]] regard them [[H1961]] as a nation. [[H1471]] 
25 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] If [[H518]] I have not [[H3808]] established [[H7760]] My covenant [[H1285]] with the day [[H3119]] and the night [[H3915]] and the fixed laws [[H2708]] of heaven [[H8064]] and earth, [[H776]] 
26 then I would also [[H1571]] reject [[H3988]] the seed [[H2233]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and of My servant [[H5650]] David, [[H1732]] so as not to take [[H3947]] from his descendants [[H2233]] rulers [[H4910]] over [[H413]] the descendants [[H2233]] of Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3446]] and Jacob. [[H3290]] For [[H3588]] I will restore them [[H7725]] from captivity [[H7622]] and have compassion on them.” [[H7355]]
