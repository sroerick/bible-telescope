# Jeremiah 26
[[Jeremiah 25|←]] • [[Jeremiah 27|→]]
1 At the beginning [[H7225]] of the reign [[H4468]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] came [[H1961]] from the LORD: [[H3068]] 
2 “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Stand [[H5975]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] house [[H1004]] and speak [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] I have commanded [[H6680]] you to speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] who come [[H935]] to worship [[H7812]] there. [[H1004]] Do not [[H408]] omit [[H1639]] a word. [[H1697]] 
3 Perhaps [[H194]] they will listen [[H8085]] and turn— [[H7725]] each [[H376]] from his evil [[H7451]] way of life— [[H1870]] so that I may relent [[H5162]] of [[H413]] the disaster [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] am planning [[H2803]] to do [[H6213]] to them  because of [[H6440]] the evil [[H7455]] of their deeds. [[H4611]] 
4 And you are to tell [[H559]] them that [[H413]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] If [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to Me [[H413]] and walk [[H1980]] in My law, [[H8451]] which [[H834]] I set [[H5414]] before you, [[H6440]] 
5 and [if you do not] listen [[H8085]] to [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of My servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] whom [[H834]] I [[H595]] have sent [[H7971]] you [[H413]] again [[H7925]] and again [[H7971]] even though you did not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] 
6 then I will make [[H5414]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] like Shiloh, [[H7887]] and [[H853]] I will make [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] an object of cursing [[H7045]] among all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth.” [[H776]] 
7 The priests, [[H3548]] the prophets, [[H5030]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] heard [[H8085]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] speaking [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] 
8 and as soon as [[H1961]] [he] [[H3414]] had finished [[H3615]] telling [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] what the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him to say, [[H1696]] the priests [[H3548]] and prophets [[H5030]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] seized him, [[H8610]] shouting, [[H559]] “You must surely die! [[H4191]] 
9 How [[H4069]] dare you prophesy [[H5012]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H559]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] will become [[H1961]] like Shiloh [[H7887]] and this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will be desolate [[H3427]] and deserted!” [[H2717]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] assembled [[H6950]] against [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
10 When the officials [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] heard [[H8085]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] they went up [[H5927]] from the king’s [[H4428]] palace [[H1004]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and sat [[H3427]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the New [[H2319]] Gate [[H8179]] of the LORD’s [house]. [[H3068]] 
11 Then the priests [[H3548]] and prophets [[H5030]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the officials [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] “This [[H2088]] man [[H376]] [is] worthy [[H4941]] of death, [[H4194]] for [[H3588]] he has prophesied [[H5012]] against [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] as [[H834]] you have heard [[H8085]] with your own ears!” [[H241]] 
12 And Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] and all the people, [[H5971]] “The LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] me to prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] and against [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] you have heard. [[H8085]] 
13 So now, [[H6258]] correct [[H3190]] your ways [[H1870]] and deeds [[H4611]] and obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] so that He [[H3068]] might relent [[H5162]] of [[H413]] the disaster [[H7451]] that [[H834]] He has pronounced [[H1696]] against you. [[H5921]] 
14 As for me, [[H589]] here [[H2005]] I am in your hands; [[H3027]] do [[H6213]] to me  what you think [[H5869]] is good [[H2896]] and right. [[H3477]] 
15 But [[H389]] know [[H3045]] for certain [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you [[H859]] put me to death, [[H4191]] you [[H859]] will bring [[H5414]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] upon yourselves, [[H5921]] on [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] and on [[H413]] its residents; [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] truly [[H571]] the LORD [[H3068]] has sent [[H7971]] me to speak [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in your hearing. [[H241]] 
16 Then the officials [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] told [[H559]] the priests [[H3548]] and prophets, [[H5030]] “This [[H2088]] man [[H376]] [is] not [[H369]] worthy [[H4941]] of death, [[H4194]] for [[H3588]] he has spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] us in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3069]] our God!” [[H430]] 
17 Some of the elders [[H2205]] of the land [[H776]] stood up [[H6965]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of the people, [[H5971]] 
18 “Micah [[H4320]] the Moreshite [[H4183]] prophesied [[H5012]] in the days [[H3117]] of Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and told [[H559]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘Zion [[H6726]] will be plowed [[H2790]] like a field, [[H7704]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] will become [[H1961]] a heap of rubble, [[H5856]] and the temple [[H1004]] mount [[H2022]] a wooded [[H3293]] ridge. [[H1116]] 
19 Did Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] [or] anyone else [[H3605]] in Judah [[H3063]] put him to death? [[H4191]] Did [Hezekiah] not [[H3808]] fear [[H3373]] the LORD [[H3068]] and seek [[H2470]] [His] [[H3068]] favor, [[H6440]] and did not the LORD [[H3068]] relent [[H5162]] of [[H413]] the disaster [[H7451]] He had pronounced [[H1696]] against them? [[H5921]] But we [[H587]] are about to bring [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] harm [[H7451]] on [[H5921]] ourselves! [[H5315]] 
20 Now there was [[H1961]] another man [[H376]] prophesying [[H5012]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] Uriah [[H223]] son [[H1121]] of Shemaiah [[H8098]] from  Kiriath-jearim. [[H7157]] He prophesied [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] and against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] in words [[H1697]] like all [[H3605]] those of Jeremiah. [[H3414]] 
21 King [[H4428]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] and all [[H3605]] his mighty men [[H1368]] and [[H3605]] officials [[H8269]] heard [[H8085]] his words, [[H1697]] and the king [[H4428]] sought [[H1245]] to put him to death. [[H4191]] But when Uriah [[H223]] found out about it, [[H8085]] he fled [[H1272]] in fear [[H3372]] and went [[H935]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] 
22 Then King [[H4428]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] sent [[H7971]] men [[H376]] to Egypt: [[H4714]] Elnathan [[H494]] son [[H1121]] of Achbor [[H5907]] along with [[H854]] some other men. [[H376]] 
23 They brought [[H3318]] Uriah [[H223]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] and took [[H935]] him to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Jehoiakim, [[H3079]] who struck him down [[H5221]] with the sword [[H2719]] and threw [[H7993]] his body [[H5038]] into [[H413]] the burial place [[H6913]] of the common [[H1121]] people. [[H5971]] 
24 Nevertheless, [[H389]] Ahikam [[H296]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphan [[H8227]] supported [[H3027]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] so he was not [[H1115]] handed over to [[H5414]] the people [[H5971]] to be put to death. [[H4191]]
