[[Jeremiah 5|←]] • [[Jeremiah 7|→]]
1 Run for cover, [[H5756]] O sons [[H1121]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] [flee from] [[H7130]] Jerusalem! [[H3389]] Sound [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] in Tekoa; [[H8620]] send up [[H5375]] a signal [[H4864]] over [[H5921]] Beth-haccherem, [[H1021]] for [[H3588]] disaster [[H7451]] looms [[H8259]] from the north, [[H6828]] even great [[H1419]] destruction. [[H7667]] 
2 Though she is beautiful [[H5000]] and delicate, [[H6026]] I will destroy [[H1819]] the Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion. [[H6726]] 
3 Shepherds [[H7462]] and their flocks [[H5739]] will come [[H935]] against her; [[H413]] they will pitch [[H8628]] their tents [[H168]] all around her, [[H5439]] each [[H376]] tending his own portion: [[H3027]] 
4 “Prepare [[H6942]] for battle [[H4421]] against her; [[H5921]] rise up, [[H6965]] let us attack [[H5927]] at noon. [[H6672]] Woe to us, [[H188]] for [[H3588]] the daylight [[H3117]] is fading; [[H6437]] the evening [[H6153]] shadows [[H6752]] grow long. [[H5186]] 
5 Rise up, [[H6965]] let us attack [[H5927]] by night [[H3915]] and destroy [[H7843]] her fortresses!” [[H759]] 
6 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Cut down [[H3772]] the trees [[H6097]] and raise [[H8210]] a siege ramp [[H5550]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] This [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] must be punished; [[H6485]] there is nothing but [[H3605]] oppression [[H6233]] in her midst. [[H7130]] 
7 As a well [[H953]] gushes [[H6979]] its water, [[H4325]] so [[H3651]] she pours out [[H6979]] her evil. [[H7451]] Violence [[H2555]] and destruction [[H7701]] resound [[H8085]] in her;  sickness [[H2483]] and wounds [[H4347]] are ever [[H8548]] before [[H5921]] Me. [[H6440]] 
8 Be warned, [[H3256]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] or [[H6435]] I [[H5315]] will turn away [[H3363]] from you; [[H4480]] I will make [[H7760]] you a desolation, [[H8077]] a land [[H776]] without [[H3808]] inhabitants.” [[H3427]] 
9 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Glean the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel [[H3478]] as thoroughly [[H5953]] as a vine. [[H1612]] Pass your hand [[H3027]] once more [[H7725]] like a grape gatherer [[H1219]] over [[H5921]] the branches.” [[H5552]] 
10 To [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] can I give [[H1696]] this warning? [[H5749]] Who will listen [to me]? [[H8085]] Look, [[H2009]] their ears [[H241]] are closed, [[H6189]] so they cannot [[H3808]] hear. [[H7181]] See, [[H2009]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has become [[H1961]] offensive to them; [[H2781]] they find no [[H3808]] pleasure in it. [[H2654]] 
11 But I am full of [[H4392]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] wrath; [[H2534]] I am tired [[H3811]] of holding it back. [[H3557]] Pour it out [[H8210]] on [[H5921]] the children [[H5768]] in the street, [[H2351]] and on [[H5921]] the young men [[H970]] gathered [[H5475]] together. [[H3162]] For [[H3588]] both [[H1571]] husband [[H376]] and [[H5973]] wife [[H802]] will be captured, [[H3920]] the old [[H2205]] and [[H5973]] the very old. [[H4390]] 
12 Their houses [[H1004]] will be turned over [[H5437]] to others, [[H312]] their fields [[H7704]] and wives [[H802]] as well, [[H3162]] for [[H3588]] I will stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land,” [[H776]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 “For [[H3588]] from the least of them [[H6996]] to [[H5704]] the greatest, [[H1419]] all [[H3605]] are greedy [[H1214]] for gain. [[H1215]] From prophet [[H5030]] to [[H5704]] priest, [[H3548]] all [[H3605]] practice [[H6213]] deceit. [[H8267]] 
14 They have dressed [[H7495]] the wound [[H7667]] of My people [[H5971]] with very little care, [[H7043]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Peace, [[H7965]] peace,’ [[H7965]] when there is no [[H369]] peace [at all]. [[H7965]] 
15 Were they ashamed [[H3001]] of the abomination [[H8441]] they committed? [[H6213]] No, [[H1571]] they were not [[H3808]] at all [[H954]] ashamed. [[H954]] They did not even [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] how to blush. [[H3637]] So [[H3651]] they will fall [[H5307]] among the fallen; [[H5307]] when [[H6256]] I punish them, [[H6485]] they will collapse,” [[H3782]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
16 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Stand [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] the crossroads [[H1870]] and look. [[H7200]] Ask [[H7592]] for the ancient [[H5769]] paths: [[H5410]] Where [[H335]] [is] the good [[H2896]] way? [[H1870]] Then walk [[H1980]] in it  and find [[H4672]] rest [[H4771]] for your souls. [[H5315]] But they said, [[H559]] ‘We will not [[H3808]] walk in it! [[H1980]] 
17 I appointed [[H6965]] watchmen [[H6822]] over you [and said], [[H5921]] ‘Listen [[H7181]] for the sound [[H6963]] of the ram’s horn.’ [[H7782]] But they answered, [[H559]] ‘We will not [[H3808]] listen!’ [[H7181]] 
18 Therefore [[H3651]] hear, [[H8085]] O nations, [[H1471]] and learn, [[H3045]] O congregations, [[H5712]] what will happen [[H834]] to them.  
19 Hear, [[H8085]] O earth! [[H776]] I [[H595]] am bringing [[H935]] disaster [[H7451]] on [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] the fruit [[H6529]] of their own schemes, [[H4284]] for [[H3588]] they have paid no [[H3808]] attention [[H7181]] to [[H5921]] My word [[H1697]] and have rejected [[H3988]] My instruction. [[H8451]] 
20 What use [[H4100]] to Me  is frankincense [[H3828]] from Sheba [[H7614]] or sweet [[H2896]] cane [[H7070]] from a distant [[H4801]] land? [[H776]] Your burnt offerings [[H5930]] are not acceptable; [[H3808]] your sacrifices [[H2077]] do not [[H3808]] please [[H6149]] Me.”  
21 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “I will lay [[H5414]] stumbling blocks [[H4383]] before [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people; [[H5971]] fathers [[H1]] and sons [[H1121]] alike [[H3162]] will be staggered; [[H3782]] friends [[H7453]] and neighbors [[H7934]] will perish.” [[H6]] 
22 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2009]] an army [[H5971]] is coming [[H935]] from the land [[H776]] of the north; [[H6828]] a great [[H1419]] nation [[H1471]] is stirred [[H5782]] from the ends [[H3411]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
23 They grasp [[H2388]] the bow [[H7198]] and spear. [[H3591]] They [[H1931]] are cruel [[H394]] and show no [[H3808]] mercy. [[H7355]] Their voice [[H6963]] roars [[H1993]] like the sea, [[H3220]] and they ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] horses, [[H5483]] lined up [[H6186]] like men [[H376]] in formation [[H4421]] against you, [[H5921]] O Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion.” [[H6726]] 
24 “We have heard [[H8085]] the reports; [[H8089]] our hands [[H3027]] are limp. [[H7503]] Anguish [[H6869]] has gripped us, [[H2388]] pain [[H2427]] like a woman in labor. [[H3205]] 
25 Do not [[H408]] go out [[H3318]] to the fields; [[H7704]] do not [[H408]] walk [[H1980]] the road. [[H1870]] For [[H3588]] the enemy [[H341]] has a sword; [[H2719]] terror [[H4032]] is on every side.” [[H5439]] 
26 “O daughter [[H1323]] of My people, [[H5971]] dress [[H2296]] yourselves in sackcloth [[H8242]] and roll [[H6428]] in ashes. [[H665]] Mourn [[H60]] with bitter [[H8563]] wailing, [[H4553]] as you would [[H6213]] for an only son, [[H3173]] for [[H3588]] suddenly [[H6597]] the destroyer [[H7703]] will come [[H935]] upon us.” [[H5921]] 
27 I have appointed you [[H5414]] a tester of metals [[H969]] among My people, [[H5971]] so you may know [[H3045]] and try [[H974]] their ways. [[H1870]] 
28 All [[H3605]] are hardened [[H5637]] rebels, [[H5493]] walking around [[H1980]] as slanderers. [[H7400]] They are bronze [[H5178]] and iron; [[H1270]] all [[H3605]] of them are corrupt. [[H7843]] 
29 The bellows [[H4647]] blow fiercely, [[H2787]] blasting away [[H800]] the lead [with fire]. [[H5777]] The refining [proceeds] [[H6884]] in vain, [[H7723]] for the wicked [[H7451]] are not [[H3808]] purged. [[H5423]] 
30 They are called [[H7121]] rejected [[H3988]] silver, [[H3701]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has rejected them. [[H3988]]
