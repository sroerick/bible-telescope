# Jeremiah 13
[[Jeremiah 12|←]] • [[Jeremiah 14|→]]
1 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Go [[H1980]] and buy [[H7069]] yourself a linen [[H6593]] loincloth [[H232]] and put [[H7760]] it around [[H5921]] your waist, [[H4975]] but do not [[H3808]] let it touch [[H935]] water.” [[H4325]] 
2 So I bought [[H7069]] a loincloth [[H232]] as the LORD [[H3068]] instructed me, [[H1697]] and I put [[H7760]] it around [[H5921]] my waist. [[H4975]] 
3 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] me a second time: [[H8145]] 
4 “Take [[H3947]] the loincloth [[H232]] that [[H834]] you bought [[H7069]] and are wearing, [[H5921]] and go [[H1980]] at once [[H6965]] to Perath [[H6578]] and hide [[H2934]] it there [[H8033]] in a crevice [[H5357]] of the rocks.” [[H5553]] 
5 So I went [[H1980]] and hid it [[H2934]] at Perath, [[H6578]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded me. [[H6680]] 
6 Many [[H7227]] days [[H3117]] later [[H7093]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Arise, [[H6965]] go [[H1980]] to Perath [[H6578]] and get [[H3947]] the loincloth [[H232]] that [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] you to hide [[H2934]] there.” [[H8033]] 
7 So I went [[H1980]] to Perath [[H6578]] and dug up [[H2658]] the loincloth, [[H232]] and I took [[H3947]] it from [[H4480]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] I had hidden it. [[H2934]] But now [[H2009]] [it] [[H232]] was ruined— [[H7843]] of no [[H3808]] use [[H6743]] at all. [[H3605]] 
8 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me: [[H413]] 
9 “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] In the same way [[H3602]] I will ruin [[H7843]] the pride [[H1347]] of Judah [[H3063]] and [[H853]] the great [[H7227]] pride [[H1347]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
10 These [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] people, [[H5971]] who refuse [[H3987]] to listen [[H8085]] to My words, [[H1697]] who follow [[H1980]] the stubbornness [[H8307]] of their own hearts, [[H3820]] and who go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve [[H5647]] and worship [[H7812]] them, [[H1992]] they will be [[H1961]] like this [[H2088]] loincloth— [[H232]] of no [[H3808]] use [[H6743]] at all. [[H3605]] 
11 For [[H3588]] just as [[H834]] a loincloth [[H232]] clings [[H1692]] to [[H413]] a man’s [[H376]] waist, [[H4975]] so {I have made} [[H3651]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and [[H853]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] cling [[H1692]] to Me, [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] so that they might be [[H1961]] My people [[H5971]] for My renown [[H8034]] and praise [[H8416]] and glory [[H8597]] but they did not [[H3808]] listen. [[H8085]] 
12 Therefore you are to tell [[H559]] them that [[H413]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Every [[H3605]] wineskin [[H5035]] shall be filled [[H4390]] with wine.’ [[H3196]] And when they reply, [[H559]] ‘Don’t we [[H3808]] surely [[H3045]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] wineskin [[H5035]] should be filled [[H4390]] with wine?’ [[H3196]] 
13 then you are to tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I am going to fill [[H4390]] with drunkenness [[H7943]] all [[H3605]] who live [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] land— [[H776]] the kings [[H4428]] who sit [[H3427]] on David’s [[H1732]] throne, [[H3678]] the priests, [[H3548]] the prophets, [[H5030]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
14 I will smash [[H5310]] them against [[H413]] each [[H376]] other, [[H251]] fathers [[H1]] and sons [[H1121]] alike, [[H3162]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] I will allow no [[H3808]] mercy [[H2550]] [or] [[H3808]] pity [[H2347]] [or] [[H3808]] compassion [[H7355]] to keep Me from destroying [[H7843]] them.’”  
15 Listen [[H8085]] and give heed. [[H238]] Do not [[H408]] be arrogant, [[H1361]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken. [[H1696]] 
16 Give [[H5414]] glory [[H3519]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] before [[H2962]] He brings darkness, [[H2821]] before [[H2962]] your feet [[H7272]] stumble [[H5062]] on [[H5921]] the dusky [[H5399]] mountains. [[H2022]] You wait [[H6960]] for light, [[H216]] but He turns it [[H7760]] into deep gloom [[H6757]] and [[H7896]] thick darkness. [[H6205]] 
17 But if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] I [[H5315]] will weep [[H1058]] alone [[H4565]] because of [[H6440]] your pride; [[H1466]] My eyes [[H5869]] will overflow [[H3381]] with tears, [[H1832]] because [[H3588]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] flock [[H5739]] has been taken captive. [[H7617]] 
18 Say [[H559]] to the king [[H4428]] and to the queen mother: [[H1377]] “Take a lowly [[H8213]] seat, [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] your glorious [[H8597]] crowns [[H5850]] have fallen [[H3381]] from your heads. [[H4761]] 
19 The cities [[H5892]] of the Negev [[H5045]] have been shut tight, [[H5462]] and no one [[H369]] can open them. [[H6605]] All [[H3605]] of Judah [[H3063]] has been carried into exile, [[H1540]] wholly [[H7965]] taken captive. [[H1540]] 
20 Lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] and see [[H7200]] those coming [[H935]] from the north. [[H6828]] Where [[H346]] is the flock [[H5739]] entrusted to you, [[H5414]] the sheep [[H6629]] that were your pride? [[H8597]] 
21 What [[H4100]] will you say [[H559]] when [[H3588]] He sets [[H6485]] over you [[H5921]] close [[H441]] allies [[H7218]] whom you [[H859]] yourself trained? [[H3925]] Will not [[H3808]] pangs of anguish [[H2256]] grip you, [[H270]] as [[H3644]] they do a woman [[H802]] in labor? [[H3205]] 
22 And if [[H3588]] you ask [[H559]] yourself, [[H3824]] “Why [[H4069]] has this [[H428]] happened to me?” [[H7122]] it is because of the magnitude [[H7230]] of your iniquity. [[H5771]] Your skirts [[H7757]] have been stripped off, [[H1540]] your body [[H6119]] exposed. [[H2554]] 
23 Can the Ethiopian [[H3569]] change [[H2015]] his skin, [[H5785]] or the leopard [[H5246]] his spots? [[H2272]] Neither [[H1571]] are you [[H859]] able [[H3201]] to do good— [[H3190]] you who are accustomed [[H3928]] to doing evil. [[H7489]] 
24 “I will scatter you [[H6327]] like chaff, [[H7179]] driven [[H5674]] by the desert [[H4057]] wind. [[H7307]] 
25 This [[H2088]] is your lot, [[H1486]] the portion [[H4490]] I have [[H853]] measured to you,” [[H4055]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “because [[H834]] you have forgotten Me [[H7911]] and trusted [[H982]] in falsehood. [[H8267]] 
26 So [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will pull your skirts [[H7757]] up [[H2834]] over [[H5921]] your face, [[H6440]] that your shame [[H7036]] may be seen. [[H7200]] 
27 Your adulteries [[H5004]] and lustful neighings, [[H4684]] your shameless [[H2154]] prostitution [[H2184]] on [[H5921]] the hills [[H1389]] [and] in the fields— [[H7704]] I have seen [[H7200]] your detestable acts. [[H8251]] Woe to you, [[H188]] O Jerusalem! [[H3389]] How long [[H310]] will you remain [[H2891]] unclean?” [[H3808]]
