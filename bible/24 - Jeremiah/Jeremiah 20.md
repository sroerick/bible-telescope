# Jeremiah 20
[[Jeremiah 19|←]] • [[Jeremiah 21|→]]
1 When Pashhur [[H6583]] the priest, [[H3548]] the son [[H1121]] of Immer [[H564]] and the chief [[H5057]] official [[H6496]] in the temple [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] prophesying [[H5012]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] 
2 [he] [[H6583]] had Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] beaten, [[H5221]] and he put [[H5414]] him [[H853]] in [[H5921]] the stocks [[H4115]] at the Upper [[H5945]] Gate [[H8179]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] which [was] [[H834]] by the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 The next day, [[H4283]] when Pashhur [[H6583]] released [[H3318]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H4480]] the stocks, [[H4115]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “The LORD [[H3068]] does not [[H3808]] call [[H7121]] you Pashhur, [[H6583]] but [[H3588]] Magor-missabib. [[H4036]] 
4 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will make you [[H5414]] a terror [[H4032]] to yourself  and to all [[H3605]] your friends. [[H157]] They will fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] of their enemies [[H341]] before your very eyes. [[H5869]] And I will hand Judah [[H3063]] over to [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he will carry them away [[H1540]] to Babylon [[H894]] and put [[H5221]] them to the sword. [[H2719]] 
5 I will give away [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the wealth [[H2633]] of this [[H2063]] city— [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] its products [[H3018]] and valuables, [[H3366]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the treasures [[H214]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah— [[H3063]] to [[H3027]] their enemies. [[H341]] They will plunder them, [[H962]] seize them, [[H3947]] and carry them off [[H935]] to Babylon. [[H894]] 
6 And you, [[H859]] Pashhur, [[H6583]] and all [[H3605]] who live [[H3427]] in your house, [[H1004]] will go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]] You will go [[H935]] to Babylon, [[H894]] and there [[H8033]] you will die [[H4191]] and [[H8033]] be buried— [[H6912]] you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] your friends [[H157]] to whom [[H834]] you have prophesied [[H5012]] these [[H1992]] lies. [[H8267]] 
7 You have deceived me, [[H6601]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and I was deceived. [[H6601]] You have overcome me [[H2388]] and prevailed. [[H3201]] I am [[H1961]] a laughingstock [[H7814]] all [[H3605]] day long; [[H3117]] everyone [[H3605]] mocks [[H3932]] me.  
8 For [[H3588]] whenever [[H1767]] I speak, [[H1696]] I cry out, [[H2199]] I proclaim [[H7121]] violence [[H2555]] and destruction. [[H7701]] For [[H3588]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has become [[H1961]] to me  a reproach [[H2781]] and derision [[H7047]] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]] 
9 If I say, [[H559]] “I will not [[H3808]] mention Him [[H2142]] or speak [[H1696]] any more [[H5750]] in His name,” [[H8034]] [His message] becomes [[H1961]] a fire [[H784]] burning [[H1197]] in my heart, [[H3820]] shut up [[H6113]] in my bones, [[H6106]] and I become weary [[H3811]] of holding it in, [[H3557]] and I cannot [[H3808]] prevail. [[H3201]] 
10 For [[H3588]] I have heard [[H8085]] the whispering [[H1681]] of many, [[H7227]] “Terror [[H4032]] is on every side! [[H4480]] Report him; [[H5046]] let us report him!” [[H5046]] All [[H3605]] my trusted friends [[H582]] watch for [[H8104]] my fall: [[H6761]] “Perhaps [[H194]] he will be deceived [[H6601]] so that we may prevail against him [[H3201]] and take [[H3947]] our vengeance upon him.” [[H5360]] 
11 But the LORD [[H3068]] is with me [[H854]] like a fearsome [[H6184]] warrior. [[H1368]] Therefore, [[H5921]] my persecutors [[H7291]] will stumble [[H3782]] and not [[H3808]] prevail. [[H3201]] Since [[H3588]] they have not [[H3808]] succeeded, [[H7919]] they will be utterly [[H3966]] put to shame, [[H954]] with an everlasting [[H5769]] disgrace [[H3639]] that will never [[H3808]] be forgotten. [[H7911]] 
12 O LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] who examines [[H974]] the righteous, [[H6662]] who sees [[H7200]] the heart [[H3820]] and mind, [[H3629]] let me see [[H7200]] Your vengeance [[H5360]] upon them, [[H1992]] for [[H3588]] to You [[H413]] I have committed [[H1540]] my cause. [[H7379]] 
13 Sing [[H7891]] to the LORD! [[H3068]] Praise [[H1984]] the LORD! [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] He rescues [[H5337]] the life [[H5315]] of the needy [[H34]] from the hands [[H3027]] of evildoers. [[H7489]] 
14 Cursed be [[H779]] the day [[H3117]] I was born! [[H3205]] May the day [[H3117]] my mother [[H517]] bore me [[H3205]] never [[H408]] be blessed. [[H1288]] 
15 Cursed be [[H779]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] brought [[H1319]] my father {the news}, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]] “A son [[H2145]] is born [[H3205]] to you,”  bringing him great joy. [[H8056]] 
16 May [[H1931]] that man [[H376]] be [[H1961]] like the cities [[H5892]] the LORD [[H834]] overthrew [[H2015]] without [[H3808]] compassion. [[H5162]] May he hear [[H8085]] an outcry [[H2201]] in the morning [[H1242]] and a battle cry [[H8643]] at noon, [[H6672]] 
17 because [[H834]] he did not [[H3808]] kill me [[H4191]] in the womb [[H7358]] so that my mother [[H517]] might have been [[H1961]] my grave, [[H6913]] and her womb [[H7358]] forever [[H5769]] enlarged. [[H2030]] 
18 Why [[H4100]] did I come out [[H3318]] of the womb [[H7358]] to see [[H7200]] only trouble [[H5999]] and sorrow, [[H3015]] and to end [[H3615]] my days [[H3117]] in shame? [[H1322]]
