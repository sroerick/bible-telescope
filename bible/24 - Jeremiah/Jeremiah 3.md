1 “If [[H2005]] a man [[H376]] divorces [[H7971]] his wife [[H802]] and she leaves [[H1980]] him [[H853]] to marry [[H1961]] another, [[H312]] can he ever [[H5750]] return [[H7725]] to her? [[H413]] Would not [[H3808]] such [[H1931]] a land [[H776]] be completely [[H2610]] defiled? [[H2610]] But you [[H859]] have played the harlot [[H2181]] with many [[H7227]] lovers— [[H7453]] and you would return [[H7725]] to Me? [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 “Lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] to [[H5921]] the barren heights [[H8205]] and see. [[H7200]] Is there any place where [[H375]] you have not [[H3808]] been violated? [[H7693]] You sat waiting [[H3427]] for [your lovers]  beside [[H5921]] the highways, [[H1870]] like a nomad [[H6163]] in the desert. [[H4057]] You have defiled [[H2610]] the land [[H776]] with your prostitution [[H2184]] and wickedness. [[H7451]] 
3 Therefore the showers [[H7241]] have been withheld, [[H4513]] and no [[H3808]] spring rains [[H4456]] have fallen. [[H1961]] Yet you have [[H1961]] the brazen look [[H4696]] of a prostitute; [[H802]] you refused [[H3985]] to be ashamed. [[H3637]] 
4 Have you not [[H3808]] just [[H6258]] called to Me, [[H7121]] ‘My Father, [[H1]] You [are] [[H859]] my friend [[H441]] from youth. [[H5271]] 
5 Will He be angry [[H5201]] forever? [[H5769]] Will He be indignant [[H8104]] to the end?’ [[H5331]] This [[H2009]] you  have spoken, [[H1696]] but you keep doing [[H6213]] all the evil [[H7451]] you can.” [[H3201]] 
6 Now in the days [[H3117]] of King [[H4428]] Josiah, [[H2977]] the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Have you seen [[H7200]] what [[H834]] faithless [[H4878]] Israel [[H3478]] has done? [[H6213]] She [[H1931]] has gone up [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] hill [[H2022]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree [[H6086]] to prostitute herself [[H2181]] there. [[H8033]] 
7 I thought [[H559]] that after [[H310]] she had done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these things, [[H428]] she would return [[H7725]] to Me. [[H413]] But she did not [[H3808]] return, [[H7725]] and her unfaithful [[H901]] sister [[H269]] Judah [[H3063]] saw it. [[H7200]] 
8 Because [[H5921]] faithless [[H4878]] Israel [[H3478]] had committed adultery, [[H5003]] I gave [[H5414]] her [[H853]] a certificate [[H5612]] of divorce [[H3748]] [and] sent her away. [[H7971]] Yet I saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] her unfaithful [[H898]] sister [[H269]] Judah [[H3063]] had no [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] and [[H1571]] prostituted herself [as well]. [[H2181]] 
9 Indifferent to [[H1961]] her immorality, [[H2184]] [Israel had] defiled [[H2610]] the land [[H776]] and committed adultery [[H5003]] with stones [[H68]] and trees. [[H6086]] 
10 Yet [[H1571]] in spite of all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] her unfaithful [[H901]] sister [[H269]] Judah [[H3063]] did not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to Me [[H413]] with all [[H3605]] her heart, [[H3820]] but only [[H3588]] in pretense,” [[H8267]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Faithless [[H4878]] Israel [[H3478]] has shown herself [[H5315]] more righteous [[H6663]] than unfaithful [[H898]] Judah. [[H3063]] 
12 Go, [[H1980]] proclaim [[H7121]] this [[H428]] message [[H1697]] toward the north: [[H6828]] ‘Return, [[H7725]] O faithless [[H4878]] Israel,’ [[H3478]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] ‘I will no longer [[H3808]] look on you with anger, [[H5307]] for [[H3588]] I [am] [[H589]] merciful,’ [[H2623]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] ‘I will not [[H3808]] be angry [[H5201]] forever. [[H5769]] 
13 Only [[H389]] acknowledge [[H3045]] your guilt, [[H5771]] that [[H3588]] you have rebelled [[H6586]] against the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] You have scattered [[H6340]] your favors [[H1870]] to foreign [gods] [[H2114]] under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree [[H6086]] and have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] My voice,’” [[H6963]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
14 “Return, [[H7725]] O faithless [[H7726]] children,” [[H1121]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am your master, [[H1166]] and I will take [[H3947]] you— [[H853]] one [[H259]] from a city [[H5892]] and two [[H8147]] from a family— [[H4940]] and bring [[H935]] you [[H853]] to Zion. [[H6726]] 
15 Then I will give [[H5414]] you [[H853]] shepherds [[H7462]] after  My own heart, [[H3820]] who will feed [[H7462]] you with knowledge [[H1844]] and understanding. [[H7919]] 
16 In those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] when [[H3588]] you multiply [[H7235]] and increase [[H6509]] in the land,” [[H776]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] will they say, [[H559]] ‘The ark [[H727]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] covenant.’ [[H1285]] It will never [[H3808]] come [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] mind, [[H3820]] and no [[H3808]] one will remember it [[H2142]] or miss it, [[H6485]] nor [[H3808]] will another one [[H5750]] be made. [[H6213]] 
17 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] will be called [[H7121]] The Throne [[H3678]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] will be gathered [[H6960]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] to [honor] [[H413]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] They will no longer [[H3808]] follow [[H1980]] the stubbornness [[H8307]] of their evil [[H7451]] hearts. [[H3820]] 
18 In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] will walk [[H1980]] with [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and they will come [[H935]] together [[H3162]] from the land [[H776]] of the north [[H6828]] to [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] I have given your ancestors [[H1]] as an inheritance. [[H5157]] 
19 Then I [[H595]] said, [[H559]] ‘How [[H349]] I long to make you [[H7896]] My sons [[H1121]] and give [[H5414]] you a desirable [[H2532]] land, [[H776]] the most beautiful [[H6643]] inheritance [[H5159]] of all [[H6635]] the nations.’ [[H1471]] I thought [[H559]] you would call Me [[H7121]] ‘Father’ [[H1]] and never [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] from following Me. [[H310]] 
20 But [[H403]] as a woman [[H802]] may betray [[H898]] her husband, [[H7453]] so [[H3651]] you have betrayed Me, [[H898]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel,” [[H3478]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
21 A voice [[H6963]] is heard [[H8085]] on [[H5921]] the barren heights, [[H8205]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] weeping [[H1065]] and begging for mercy, [[H8469]] because [[H3588]] they have perverted [[H5753]] their ways [[H1870]] [and] forgotten [[H7911]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]] 
22 “Return, [[H7725]] O faithless [[H7726]] children, [[H1121]] [and] I will heal [[H7495]] your faithlessness.” [[H4878]] “Here we are. [[H2005]] We come to You, [[H857]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]] 
23 Surely [[H403]] deception [[H8267]] [comes from] the hills, [[H1389]] commotion [[H1995]] from the mountains, [[H2022]] but surely [[H403]] the salvation [[H8668]] of Israel [[H3478]] is in the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]] 
24 From our youth, [[H5271]] that shameful [god] [[H1322]] has consumed [[H398]] what our fathers [[H1]] have worked for— [[H3018]] their flocks [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] their sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
25 Let us lie down [[H7901]] in our shame; [[H1322]] let our disgrace [[H3639]] cover us. [[H3680]] We have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] both we [[H587]] and our fathers; [[H1]] from our youth [[H5271]] even to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] we have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God.” [[H430]]
