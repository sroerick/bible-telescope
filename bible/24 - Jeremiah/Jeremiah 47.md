# Jeremiah 47
[[Jeremiah 46|←]] • [[Jeremiah 48|→]]
1 This is the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] about [[H413]] the Philistines [[H6430]] before [[H2962]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] conquered [[H5221]] Gaza. [[H5804]] 
2 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “See how [[H2009]] the waters [[H4325]] are rising [[H5927]] from the north [[H6828]] and becoming [[H1961]] an overflowing [[H7857]] torrent. [[H5158]] They will overflow [[H7857]] the land [[H776]] and its fullness, [[H4393]] the cities [[H5892]] and their inhabitants. [[H3427]] The people [[H120]] will cry out, [[H2199]] and all [[H3605]] who dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] will wail [[H3213]] 
3 at the sound [[H6963]] of the galloping [[H8161]] hooves [[H6541]] of stallions, [[H47]] the rumbling [[H7494]] of chariots, [[H7393]] and the clatter [[H1995]] of their wheels. [[H1534]] The fathers [[H1]] will not [[H3808]] turn back [[H6437]] for [[H413]] their sons; [[H1121]] their hands [[H3027]] will hang limp. [[H7510]] 
4 For [[H5921]] the day [[H3117]] has come [[H935]] to destroy [[H7703]] all [[H3605]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] to cut off [[H3772]] from Tyre [[H6865]] and Sidon [[H6721]] every [[H3605]] remaining [[H8300]] ally. [[H5826]] Indeed, [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is about to destroy [[H7703]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] the remnant [[H7611]] from the coasts [[H339]] of Caphtor. [[H3731]] 
5 The people of Gaza [[H5804]] will shave their heads in mourning; [[H7144]] Ashkelon [[H831]] will be silenced. [[H1820]] O remnant [[H7611]] of their valley, [[H6010]] how long [[H5704]] will you gash yourself? [[H1413]] 
6 ‘Alas, [[H1945]] O sword [[H2719]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] how long [[H5704]] until you rest? [[H3808]] Return [[H622]] to [[H413]] your sheath; [[H8593]] cease [[H7280]] and be still!’ [[H1826]] 
7 How [[H349]] can it rest [[H8252]] when the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded it? [[H6680]] He has appointed it [[H3259]] against [[H413]] Ashkelon [[H831]] and the shore [[H2348]] of its coastland.” [[H3220]]
