# Jeremiah 7
[[Jeremiah 6|←]] • [[Jeremiah 8|→]]
1 This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the LORD, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Stand [[H5975]] in the gate [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and proclaim [[H7121]] this [[H2088]] message: [[H1697]] ‘Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] you people of Judah [[H3063]] who enter [[H935]] through these [[H428]] gates [[H8179]] to worship [[H7812]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel: [[H3478]] Correct [[H3190]] your ways [[H1870]] and your deeds, [[H4611]] and I will allow you to live [[H7931]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]] 
4 Do not [[H408]] trust [[H982]] in deceptive [[H8267]] words, [[H1697]] chanting, [[H559]] “This [[H1992]] is the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
5 For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you really change [[H3190]] your ways [[H1870]] and deeds, [[H4611]] if [[H518]] you act [[H6213]] justly [[H4941]] toward one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] 
6 if you no [[H3808]] longer oppress [[H6231]] the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow, [[H490]] and no [[H408]] longer shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] in this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] or follow [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to your own harm, [[H7451]] 
7 then I will allow you to live [[H7931]] in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] in the land [[H776]] I gave [[H5414]] to your fathers [[H1]] forever [[H4480]] and [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]] 
8 But look, [[H2009]] you [[H859]] keep trusting [[H982]] in [[H5921]] deceptive [[H8267]] words [[H1697]] to no [[H1115]] avail. [[H3276]] 
9 Will you steal [[H1589]] and murder, [[H7523]] commit adultery [[H5003]] and perjury, [[H7650]] burn incense [[H6999]] to Baal, [[H1168]] and follow [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] that [[H834]] you have not [[H3808]] known, [[H3045]] 
10 and then come [[H935]] and stand [[H5975]] before Me [[H6440]] in this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] which bears [[H7121]] My name, [[H8034]] and say, [[H559]] “We are delivered, [[H5337]] so [[H4616]] we can continue with [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] abominations”? [[H8441]] 
11 Has this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] bears [[H7121]] My name, [[H8034]] become [[H1961]] a den [[H4631]] of robbers [[H6530]] in your sight? [[H5869]] Yes, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] too [[H1571]] have seen it, [[H7200]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3069]] 
12 But [[H3588]] go [[H1980]] now [[H4994]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] in Shiloh [[H7887]] where [[H834]] I first [[H7223]] made a dwelling [[H7931]] for My name, [[H8034]] and see [[H7200]] what [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] to it  because of [[H6440]] the wickedness [[H7451]] of My people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
13 And now, [[H6258]] because [[H3282]] you have done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things, [[H4639]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and because I have spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] you time and time again [[H7925]] but you would not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] and I have called [[H7121]] to you [[H853]] but you would not [[H3808]] answer, [[H6030]] 
14 therefore what I did [[H6213]] to Shiloh [[H7887]] I will now do [[H6213]] to the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] bears [[H7121]] My name, [[H8034]] the house in which [[H834]] you [[H859]] trust, [[H982]] the place [[H4725]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] to you  and your fathers. [[H1]] 
15 And I will cast you [[H7993]] out of [[H5921]] My presence, [[H6440]] just as [[H834]] I have cast out [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] your brothers, [[H251]] all [[H3605]] the descendants [[H2233]] of Ephraim.’ [[H669]] 
16 As for you, [[H859]] do not [[H408]] pray [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] these [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]] Do not [[H408]] offer [[H5375]] a plea [[H7440]] or petition [[H8605]] on their behalf, [[H1157]] and do not [[H408]] beg Me, [[H6293]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H369]] listen [[H8085]] to you. [[H853]] 
17 Do you not [[H369]] see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] they [[H1992]] are doing [[H6213]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem? [[H3389]] 
18 The sons [[H1121]] gather [[H3950]] wood, [[H6086]] the fathers [[H1]] light [[H1197]] the fire, [[H784]] and the women [[H802]] knead [[H3888]] the dough [[H1217]] to make [[H6213]] cakes [[H3561]] for the Queen [[H4446]] of Heaven; [[H8064]] they pour out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] to other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to [[H4616]] provoke Me to anger. [[H3707]] 
19 But am I the one [[H1992]] they are provoking? [[H3707]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Is it not [[H3808]] themselves [[H853]] they spite, [[H4616]] to their own shame? [[H1322]] 
20 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] My anger, [[H639]] My fury, [[H2534]] will [[H5413]] be poured out on [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] on [[H5921]] man [[H120]] and beast, [[H929]] on [[H5921]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] and [[H5921]] the produce [[H6529]] of the land, [[H127]] and it will burn [[H1197]] and not [[H3808]] be extinguished. [[H3518]] 
21 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Add your burnt offerings [[H5930]] to [[H5921]] your other sacrifices [[H2077]] and eat [[H398]] the meat yourselves! [[H1320]] 
22 For [[H3588]] when [[H3117]] I brought [[H3318]] your fathers [[H1]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] I did not merely [[H3808]] command them [[H6680]] about [[H5921]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sacrifices, [[H2077]] 
23 but [[H3588]] this is what [[H2088]] I commanded them: [[H6680]] Obey Me, [[H8085]] and I will be [[H1961]] your God, [[H430]] and you [[H859]] will be [[H1961]] My people. [[H5971]] You must walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] I have commanded [[H6680]] you, [[H853]] so that [[H4616]] it may go well with you. [[H3190]] 
24 Yet they did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] or pay attention, [[H5186]] but they followed [[H1980]] the stubborn [[H8307]] inclinations [[H4156]] of their own evil [[H7451]] hearts. [[H3820]] They went [[H1961]] backward [[H268]] and not forward. [[H3808]] 
25 From [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] your fathers [[H1]] came out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] I have sent [[H7971]] you [[H413]] all [[H3605]] My servants [[H5650]] the prophets [[H5030]] time and time again. [[H7925]] 
26 Yet they would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to Me [[H413]] [or] [[H3808]] incline [[H5186]] their ear, [[H241]] but they stiffened [[H7185]] their necks [[H6203]] [and] did more evil [[H7489]] than their fathers.’ [[H1]] 
27 When you tell [[H1696]] them [[H413]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] they will not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to you. [[H413]] When you call [[H7121]] to them, [[H413]] they will not [[H3808]] answer. [[H6030]] 
28 Therefore you must say [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] This [[H2088]] is the nation [[H1471]] that [[H834]] would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] and would not [[H3808]] receive [[H3947]] correction. [[H4148]] Truth [[H530]] has perished; [[H6]] it has disappeared [[H3772]] from their lips. [[H6310]] 
29 Cut off [[H1494]] your hair [[H5145]] and throw it away. [[H7993]] Raise up [[H5375]] a lamentation [[H7015]] on [[H5921]] the barren heights, [[H8205]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has rejected [[H3988]] and forsaken [[H5203]] the generation [[H1755]] of His wrath. [[H5678]] 
30 For [[H3588]] the people [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] have done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in My sight, [[H5869]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] They have set up [[H7760]] their abominations [[H8251]] in the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] bears [[H7121]] My name, [[H8034]] and so have defiled it. [[H2930]] 
31 They have built [[H1129]] the high places [[H1116]] of Topheth [[H8612]] in the Valley of Hinnom [[H1516]] so they could burn [[H8313]] their sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] in the fire— [[H784]] something I did not [[H3808]] command, [[H6680]] nor [[H3808]] did it enter [[H5927]] My mind. [[H3820]] 
32 So [[H3651]] beware! [[H2009]] The days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when this place will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be called [[H559]] Topheth [[H8612]] and the Valley of Hinnom, [[H1516]] but [[H3588]] the Valley [[H1516]] of Slaughter. [[H2028]] For they will bury [the dead] [[H6912]] in Topheth [[H8612]] until there is no [[H369]] more room. [[H4725]] 
33 The corpses [[H5038]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] will become [[H1961]] food [[H3978]] for the birds [[H5775]] of the sky [[H8064]] and the beasts [[H929]] of the earth, [[H776]] and there will be no one [[H369]] to scare them away. [[H2729]] 
34 I will remove [[H7673]] from the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] the sounds [[H6963]] of joy [[H8342]] and gladness [[H8057]] and the voices [[H6963]] of the bride [[H3618]] and [[H6963]] bridegroom, [[H2860]] for [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] will become [[H1961]] a wasteland.” [[H2723]]
