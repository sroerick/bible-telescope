# Jeremiah 16
[[Jeremiah 15|←]] • [[Jeremiah 17|→]]
1 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me: [[H413]] 
2 “You must not [[H3808]] marry [[H3947]] [or] [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] sons [[H1121]] or daughters [[H1323]] in this [[H2088]] place.” [[H4725]] 
3 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] concerning [[H5921]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] born in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and [[H5921]] the mothers [[H517]] who bore them, [[H3205]] and the fathers [[H1]] who fathered [[H3205]] them in this [[H2063]] land: [[H776]] 
4 “They will die [[H4191]] from deadly [[H4463]] diseases. [[H8463]] They will not [[H3808]] be mourned [[H5594]] or buried, [[H6912]] but will lie [[H1961]] like dung [[H1828]] on [[H5921]] the ground. [[H127]] They will be finished off [[H3615]] by sword [[H2719]] and famine, [[H7458]] and their corpses [[H5038]] will become [[H1961]] food [[H3978]] for the birds [[H5775]] of the sky [[H8064]] and the beasts [[H929]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
5 Indeed, [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] enter [[H935]] a house [[H1004]] [where there is] a funeral meal. [[H4798]] Do not [[H408]] go [[H1980]] to mourn [[H5594]] or show sympathy, [[H5110]] for [[H3588]] I have removed [[H622]] My peace [[H7965]] from this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] My loving devotion [[H2617]] and [[H853]] compassion. [[H7356]] 
6 Both great [[H1419]] and small [[H6996]] will die [[H4191]] in this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]] They will not [[H3808]] be buried [[H6912]] [or] [[H3808]] mourned, [[H5594]] nor [[H3808]] will anyone cut [[H1413]] himself or shave his head [[H7139]] for them. [[H1992]] 
7 No food [[H3808]] will be offered [[H6536]] to comfort [[H5162]] those who mourn [[H60]] the dead; [[H4191]] not even [[H3808]] a cup [[H3563]] of consolation [[H8575]] will be given [[H8248]] for [[H5921]] the loss of a father [[H1]] or mother. [[H517]] 
8 You must not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] a house [[H1004]] where there is feasting [[H4960]] and sit down [[H3427]] with them [[H854]] to eat [[H398]] and drink. [[H8354]] 
9 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] I am going to remove [[H7673]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] before your very eyes [[H5869]] and in your days, [[H3117]] the sounds [[H6963]] of joy [[H8342]] and gladness, [[H8057]] the voices [[H6963]] of the groom [[H2860]] and the bride. [[H3618]] 
10 When [[H3588]] you tell [[H5046]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] they will ask [[H559]] you, [[H413]] ‘Why [[H5921]] has the LORD [[H3068]] pronounced [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] disaster [[H7451]] against us? [[H5921]] What [[H4100]] is our guilt? [[H5771]] What [[H4100]] is the sin [[H2403]] that [[H834]] we have committed [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] our God? [[H430]] 
11 Then you are to answer them: [[H559]] ‘[It is] because [[H5921]] your fathers [[H1]] have forsaken [[H5800]] Me,’ [[H853]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] ‘and followed [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and served [[H5647]] and worshiped them. [[H7812]] They abandoned Me [[H5800]] and did not [[H3808]] keep [[H8104]] My instruction. [[H8451]] 
12 And you [[H859]] have done [[H6213]] more evil [[H7489]] than your fathers. [[H1]] See how [[H2005]] each of you [[H376]] was following [[H1980]] the stubbornness [[H8307]] of his evil [[H7451]] heart, [[H3820]] instead of [[H1115]] obeying [[H8085]] Me. [[H413]] 
13 So I will cast [[H2904]] you [[H853]] out of [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] into [[H5921]] a land [[H776]] that [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] you [[H859]] nor your fathers [[H1]] have known. [[H3045]] There [[H8033]] you will serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] for [[H834]] I will show [[H5414]] you  no [[H3808]] favor. [[H2594]] 
14 Yet [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when men will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] say, [[H559]] ‘As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] brought [[H5927]] the Israelites {up} [[H1121]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt.’ [[H4714]] 
15 Instead [they will say], [[H3588]] ‘As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] brought [[H5927]] the Israelites {up} [[H1121]] out of the land [[H776]] of the north [[H6828]] and all [[H3605]] the other lands [[H776]] to which [[H834]] He had banished them.’ [[H5080]] For I will return [[H7725]] them to [[H5921]] their land [[H127]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] to their ancestors. [[H1]] 
16 But for now [[H2005]] I will send for [[H7971]] many [[H7227]] fishermen, [[H1771]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and they will catch them. [[H1770]] After that [[H310]] I will send [[H7971]] for many [[H7227]] hunters, [[H6719]] and they will hunt them down [[H6679]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] mountain [[H2022]] and hill, [[H1389]] even from the clefts [[H5357]] of the rocks. [[H5553]] 
17 For [[H3588]] My eyes [[H5869]] [are] on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] their ways. [[H1870]] They are not [[H3808]] hidden [[H5641]] from My face, [[H6440]] and their guilt [[H5771]] is not [[H3808]] concealed [[H6845]] from [[H5048]] My eyes. [[H5869]] 
18 And I will first [[H7223]] repay them [[H7999]] double [[H4932]] their iniquity [[H5771]] and their sin, [[H2403]] because [[H5921]] they have defiled [[H2490]] My land [[H776]] with the carcasses [[H5038]] of their detestable idols, [[H8251]] and they have filled [[H4390]] My inheritance [[H5159]] with their abominations.” [[H8441]] 
19 O LORD, [[H3068]] my strength [[H5797]] and my fortress, [[H4581]] my refuge [[H4498]] in the day [[H3117]] of distress, [[H6869]] the nations [[H1471]] will come [[H935]] to You [[H413]] from the ends [[H657]] of the earth, [[H776]] and they will say, [[H559]] “Our fathers [[H1]] inherited [[H5157]] nothing but [[H389]] lies, [[H8267]] worthless idols [[H1892]] of no [[H369]] benefit at all.” [[H3276]] 
20 Can man [[H120]] make [[H6213]] gods for himself? [[H430]] Such [[H1992]] are not [[H3808]] gods! [[H430]] 
21 “Therefore [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I will inform them, [[H3045]] and this [[H2063]] time [[H6471]] I will make them know [[H3045]] My power [[H3027]] and My might; [[H1369]] then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] My name [[H8034]] is the LORD.” [[H3068]]
