# Jeremiah 40
[[Jeremiah 39|←]] • [[Jeremiah 41|→]]
1 This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H4480]] the LORD [[H3068]] after [[H310]] Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] had released [[H7971]] him [[H853]] at Ramah, [[H7414]] having found [[H3947]] him [[H1931]] bound [[H631]] in chains [[H246]] among [[H8432]] all [[H3605]] the captives [[H1546]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah [[H3063]] who were being exiled [[H1540]] to Babylon. [[H894]] 
2 The captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] found [[H3947]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] decreed [[H1696]] this [[H2063]] disaster [[H7451]] on [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] 
3 and now the LORD [[H3068]] has fulfilled it; [[H935]] He has done [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] He said. [[H1696]] Because [[H3588]] you [people] have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] and have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] His voice, [[H6963]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] has happened [[H1961]] to you.  
4 But now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] I am freeing [[H6605]] you today [[H3117]] from [[H4480]] the chains [[H246]] that [[H834]] were on [[H5921]] your wrists. [[H3027]] If [[H518]] it pleases [[H2896]] you to come [[H935]] with [[H854]] me to Babylon, [[H894]] then come, [[H935]] and I will take care of [[H7760]] you. [[H5921]] But if [[H518]] it seems wrong [[H7489]] to you to come [[H935]] with me [[H854]] to Babylon, [[H894]] go no farther. [[H2308]] Look, [[H7200]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] is before you. [[H6440]] Wherever it seems [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] and right [[H3477]] for you to go, [[H1980]] go [[H1980]] there. [[H8033]] 
5 But before Jeremiah [[H3808]] turned to go, [[H7725]] Nebuzaradan [[H7725]] told him, [[H413]] “Return to Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] has appointed [[H6485]] over the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and stay [[H3427]] with [[H854]] him among [[H8432]] the people, [[H5971]] or [[H176]] go [[H1980]] anywhere else [[H413]] that seems right. [[H3477]] Then the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] gave [[H5414]] him  a ration [[H737]] and a gift [[H4864]] and released him. [[H7971]] 
6 So Jeremiah [[H3414]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] at Mizpah [[H4708]] and stayed [[H3427]] with him [[H854]] among [[H8432]] the people [[H5971]] who were left [[H7604]] in the land. [[H776]] 
7 When all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] and men [[H376]] of the armies [[H2428]] in the field [[H7704]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had appointed [[H6485]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] over the land [[H776]] and that [[H3588]] he had put him in charge [[H6485]] of the men, [[H376]] women, [[H802]] and children [[H2945]] [who were] the poorest [[H1803]] of the land [[H776]] [and] [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] been exiled [[H1540]] to Babylon, [[H894]] 
8 they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] at Mizpah— [[H4708]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] Johanan [[H3110]] and Jonathan [[H3129]] the sons [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] Seraiah [[H8304]] son [[H1121]] of Tanhumeth, [[H8576]] the sons [[H1121]] of Ephai [[H5778]] the Netophathite, [[H5200]] and Jezaniah [[H3153]] son [[H1121]] of the Maacathite: [[H4602]] they [[H1992]] and their men. [[H582]] 
9 Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] swore an oath [[H7650]] to them  and their men, [[H376]] assuring them, [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] to serve [[H5647]] the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] Live [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] and serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and it will go well [[H3190]] for you.  
10 As for me, [[H589]] I will [[H2005]] stay [[H3427]] in Mizpah [[H4709]] to represent [[H5975]] you before [[H6440]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] who [[H834]] come [[H935]] to us. [[H413]] As for you, [[H859]] gather in [[H622]] wine, [[H3196]] summer fruit, [[H7019]] and oil, [[H8081]] place them [[H7760]] in your storage jars, [[H3627]] and live [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] you have taken over. [[H8610]] 
11 When all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] in Moab, [[H4124]] Ammon, [[H1121]] Edom, [[H123]] and all [[H3605]] the other lands [[H776]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had left [[H5414]] a remnant [[H7611]] in Judah [[H3063]] and had appointed [[H6485]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] over them, [[H5921]] 
12 they [[H3064]] all [[H3605]] returned [[H7725]] from all [[H3605]] the places [[H4725]] to which [[H834]] they had been banished [[H5080]] and came [[H935]] to the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] at Mizpah. [[H4708]] And they gathered [[H622]] an abundance [[H7235]] of wine [[H3196]] and summer fruit. [[H7019]] 
13 Meanwhile, Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the armies [[H2428]] in the field [[H7704]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] at Mizpah [[H4708]] 
14 and said to him, [[H559]] “Are you aware [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Baalis [[H1185]] king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] has sent [[H7971]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] to take [[H5221]] your life?” [[H5315]] But Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] did not [[H3808]] believe them. [[H539]] 
15 Then Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah [[H7143]] spoke [[H559]] privately [[H5643]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] at Mizpah. [[H4709]] “Let me go [[H1980]] and kill [[H5221]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah,” [[H5418]] he said. [[H559]] “No [[H3808]] one [[H376]] will know it. [[H3045]] Why [[H4100]] should he take [[H5221]] your life [[H5315]] and scatter [[H6327]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] who have gathered [[H6908]] to you, [[H413]] so that the remnant [[H7611]] of Judah [[H3063]] would perish?” [[H6]] 
16 But Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] “Do not [[H408]] do [[H6213]] such a thing! [[H1697]] What you are [[H859]] saying [[H1696]] about [[H413]] Ishmael [[H3458]] is a lie.” [[H8267]]
