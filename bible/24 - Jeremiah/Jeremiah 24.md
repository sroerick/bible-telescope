# Jeremiah 24
[[Jeremiah 23|←]] • [[Jeremiah 25|→]]
1 After [[H310]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had carried away [[H1540]] Jeconiah [[H3204]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the officials [[H8269]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the craftsmen [[H2796]] and metalsmiths [[H4525]] from Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and had brought [[H935]] them to Babylon, [[H894]] the LORD [[H3068]] showed [[H7200]] me two [[H8147]] baskets [[H1736]] of figs [[H8384]] placed [[H3259]] in front of [[H6440]] the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 One [[H259]] basket [[H1731]] [had] very [[H3966]] good [[H2896]] figs, [[H8384]] like those that ripen early, [[H8384]] but the other [[H259]] basket [[H1731]] contained very [[H3966]] poor [[H7451]] figs, [[H8384]] so bad [[H7455]] they could not [[H3808]] be eaten. [[H398]] 
3 “Jeremiah,” [[H3414]] the LORD [[H3068]] asked, [[H559]] “what [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] see?” [[H7200]] “Figs!” [[H8384]] I replied. [[H559]] “The good [[H2896]] figs [[H8384]] are very [[H3966]] good, [[H2896]] but the bad figs [[H7451]] are very [[H3966]] bad, [[H7451]] so bad [[H7455]] they cannot [[H3808]] be eaten.” [[H398]] 
4 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] 
5 “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Like these [[H428]] good [[H2896]] figs, [[H8384]] so [[H3651]] I regard [[H5234]] as good [[H2896]] the exiles [[H1546]] from Judah, [[H3063]] whom [[H834]] I have sent away [[H7971]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] to the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] 
6 I will keep [[H7760]] My eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] their good [[H2896]] and will return [[H7725]] them to [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]] I will build them up [[H1129]] and not [[H3808]] tear [them] down; [[H2040]] I will plant [[H5193]] them and not [[H3808]] uproot them. [[H5428]] 
7 I will give [[H5414]] them a heart [[H3820]] to know Me, [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] They will be [[H1961]] My people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] their  God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] they will return [[H7725]] to Me [[H413]] with all [[H3605]] their heart. [[H3820]] 
8 But like the bad [[H7451]] figs, [[H8384]] so bad [[H7455]] they cannot [[H3808]] be eaten, [[H398]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] so [[H3651]] I will deal with [[H5414]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] his officials, [[H8269]] and the remnant [[H7611]] of Jerusalem— [[H3389]] those remaining [[H7604]] in this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] and those living [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
9 I will make [[H5414]] them  a horror [[H2113]] and an offense [[H7451]] to all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth, [[H776]] a disgrace, [[H2781]] an object of scorn, [[H4912]] ridicule, [[H8148]] and cursing, [[H7045]] wherever [[H3605]] I have banished them. [[H5080]] 
10 And I will send [[H7971]] the sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague [[H1698]] against them, [[H5704]] until they have perished [[H8552]] from [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] I gave [[H5414]] to them [[H1992]] and their fathers.’” [[H1]]
