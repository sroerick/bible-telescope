# Jeremiah 34
[[Jeremiah 33|←]] • [[Jeremiah 35|→]]
1 This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the LORD [[H3068]] when Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] all [[H3605]] his army, [[H2428]] all [[H3605]] the earthly [[H776]] kingdoms [[H4467]] under his control, [[H4475]] and all [[H3605]] the other nations [[H5971]] were fighting [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and all [[H3605]] its surrounding cities: [[H5892]] 
2 “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] speak [[H559]] to [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and tell [[H559]] him [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] I am about to hand this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] over to [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he will burn it down. [[H8313]] 
3 As for you, [[H859]] you will not [[H3808]] escape [[H4422]] his grasp [[H3027]] but [[H3588]] will surely be captured [[H8610]] and handed over to [[H3027]] him. [[H5414]] You will see [[H7200]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] eye [[H5869]] to [[H854]] eye [[H5869]] and speak to him [[H1696]] face [[H6310]] to face; [[H6310]] and you will go [[H935]] to Babylon. [[H894]] 
4 Yet [[H389]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] O Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] concerning you: [[H5921]] You will not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] by the sword; [[H2719]] 
5 you will die [[H4191]] in peace. [[H7965]] As [spices] were burned [[H4955]] for your fathers, [[H1]] the former [[H7223]] kings [[H4428]] who [[H834]] preceded [[H1961]] you, [[H6440]] so [people] will burn [spices] [[H8313]] for you [[H3651]] and lament, [[H5594]] ‘Alas, [[H1945]] O master!’ [[H113]] For [[H3588]] I Myself [[H589]] have spoken [[H1696]] this word, [[H1697]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
6 In Jerusalem, then, [[H3389]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] related [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] 
7 as the army [[H2428]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] was fighting [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and the remaining [[H3498]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah— [[H3063]] against [[H413]] Lachish [[H3923]] and Azekah. [[H5825]] For [[H3588]] these [[H2007]] were the only remaining [[H7604]] fortified [[H4013]] cities [[H5892]] left [[H5892]] in Judah. [[H3063]] 
8 After [[H310]] King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] had made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] to proclaim [[H7121]] liberty, [[H1865]] the word [[H1697]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the LORD [[H3069]] 
9 that each man [[H376]] should free [[H7971]] his Hebrew [[H5680]] slaves, [[H5650]] [both male] and female, [[H5680]] and no [[H1115]] one [[H376]] should hold [[H5647]] his fellow [[H251]] Jew {in bondage}. [[H3064]] 
10 So all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] entered [[H935]] into this covenant [[H1285]] agreed [[H8085]] to free [[H7971]] their menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants [[H8198]] and no longer [[H1115]] to hold them in bondage. [[H5647]] They obeyed [[H8085]] and released them, [[H7971]] 
11 but later [[H310]] they changed their minds [[H7725]] and took back [[H7725]] the menservants [[H5650]] and [[H853]] maidservants [[H8198]] they had freed, [[H7971]] and they forced them [[H3533]] to become slaves [[H5650]] again. [[H8198]] 
12 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the LORD, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] 
13 “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] I [[H595]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] your forefathers [[H1]] when [[H3117]] I brought them out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery, [[H5650]] saying: [[H559]] 
14 Every [[H7093]] seventh [[H7651]] year, [[H8141]] each [[H376]] of you must free [[H7971]] his Hebrew [[H5680]] brother [[H251]] who [[H834]] has sold himself [[H4376]] to you.  He may serve [[H5647]] you six [[H8337]] years, [[H8141]] but then you must let him go [[H7971]] free. [[H2670]] But your fathers [[H1]] did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] or incline [[H5186]] their ear. [[H241]] 
15 In this day [[H3117]] you [[H859]] repented [[H7725]] and did [[H6213]] what pleased [[H3477]] Me; [[H5869]] each [[H376]] of you proclaimed [[H7121]] liberty [[H1865]] for his neighbor. [[H7453]] You made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] before Me [[H6440]] in the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] bears [[H7121]] My name. [[H8034]] 
16 But now you have changed your minds [[H7725]] and profaned [[H2490]] My name. [[H8034]] Each of you [[H376]] has taken back [[H7725]] the menservants and maidservants [[H5650]] whom [[H834]] you had set [[H7971]] at liberty [[H2670]] to go wherever they wanted, [[H5315]] and you have again forced [[H3533]] them [[H853]] to be [[H1961]] your slaves. [[H5650]] 
17 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] You [[H859]] have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] Me; [[H413]] you have not proclaimed [[H7121]] freedom, [[H1865]] each man [[H376]] for his brother [[H251]] and for his neighbor. [[H7453]] So now [[H2005]] I proclaim [[H7121]] freedom [[H1865]] for you,  declares [[H5002]] the LORD— [[H3068]] [freedom] to [fall] [[H413]] by sword, [[H2719]] by [[H413]] plague, [[H1698]] and by [[H413]] famine! [[H7458]] I will make you [[H5414]] a horror [[H2113]] to all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
18 And those who have transgressed [[H5674]] My covenant [[H1285]] and have not [[H3808]] fulfilled [[H6965]] the terms [[H1697]] of the covenant [[H1285]] they made [[H3772]] before Me, [[H6440]] I will treat [[H5414]] like the calf [[H5695]] they cut [[H3772]] in two [[H8147]] in order to pass [[H5674]] between [[H996]] its pieces. [[H1335]] 
19 The officials [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the court officials, [[H5631]] the priests, [[H3548]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] who passed [[H5674]] between [[H996]] the pieces [[H1335]] of the calf, [[H5695]] 
20 I will hand over [[H5414]] to [[H3027]] their enemies [[H341]] who seek [[H1245]] their lives. [[H5315]] Their corpses [[H5038]] will become [[H1961]] food [[H3978]] for the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] and the beasts [[H929]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
21 I will hand Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and his officials [[H8269]] over to [[H5414]] their enemies [[H341]] who seek [[H1245]] their lives, [[H5315]] to the army [[H2428]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] that had withdrawn [[H5927]] from you. [[H5921]] 
22 Behold, [[H2005]] I am going to give the command, [[H6680]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and I will bring them back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city. [[H5892]] They will fight [[H3898]] against it, [[H5921]] capture it, [[H3920]] and burn it down. [[H8313]] And [[H853]] I will make [[H5414]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] a desolation, [[H8077]] without [[H369]] inhabitant.” [[H3427]]
