# Jeremiah 14
[[Jeremiah 13|←]] • [[Jeremiah 15|→]]
1 [This is] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] concerning [[H5921]] the drought: [[H1226]] 
2 “Judah [[H3063]] mourns [[H56]] and her gates [[H8179]] languish. [[H535]] [Her people] wail [[H6937]] for the land, [[H776]] and a cry [[H6682]] goes up [[H5927]] from Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
3 The nobles [[H117]] send [[H7971]] their servants [[H6810]] for water; [[H4325]] they go [[H935]] to [[H5921]] the cisterns, [[H1356]] but find [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] water [[H4325]] their jars [[H3627]] return [[H7725]] empty. [[H7387]] They are ashamed [[H954]] and humiliated; [[H3637]] they cover [[H2645]] their heads. [[H7218]] 
4 The ground [[H127]] is cracked [[H2865]] because [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] rain [[H1653]] has fallen on the land. [[H776]] The farmers [[H406]] are ashamed; [[H954]] they cover [[H2645]] their heads. [[H7218]] 
5 Even [[H3588]] the doe [[H365]] in the field [[H7704]] deserts [[H5800]] her newborn fawn [[H3205]] because [[H3588]] there is [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] grass. [[H1877]] 
6 Wild donkeys [[H6501]] stand [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] barren heights; [[H8205]] they pant [[H7602]] for air [[H7307]] like jackals; [[H8577]] their eyes [[H5869]] fail [[H3615]] for [[H3588]] lack [[H369]] of pasture.” [[H6212]] 
7 Although [[H518]] our iniquities [[H5771]] testify against us, [[H6030]] O LORD, [[H3068]] act [[H6213]] for the sake [[H4616]] of Your name. [[H8034]] Indeed, [[H3588]] our rebellions [[H4878]] are many; [[H7231]] we have sinned against You. [[H2398]] 
8 O Hope [[H4723]] of Israel, [[H3478]] its Savior [[H3467]] in times [[H6256]] of distress, [[H6869]] why [[H4100]] are You [[H1961]] like a stranger [[H1616]] in the land, [[H776]] like a traveler [[H732]] who stays but a night? [[H5186]] 
9 Why [[H4100]] are You [[H1961]] like a man [[H376]] taken by surprise, [[H1724]] like a warrior [[H1368]] powerless [[H3201]] to save? [[H3467]] Yet You [[H859]] are among us, [[H7130]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and we are called [[H7121]] by Your name. [[H8034]] Do not [[H408]] forsake us! [[H3240]] 
10 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] about this [[H2088]] people: [[H5971]] “Truly [[H3651]] they love [[H157]] to wander; [[H5128]] they have not [[H3808]] restrained [[H2820]] their feet. [[H7272]] So the LORD [[H3068]] does not [[H3808]] accept them; [[H7521]] He will now [[H6258]] remember [[H2142]] their guilt [[H5771]] and call their sins to account.” [[H6485]] 
11 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Do not [[H408]] pray [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] the well-being [[H2896]] of this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]] 
12 Although [[H3588]] they may fast, [[H6684]] I will not [[H369]] listen to [[H8085]] their cry; [[H7440]] although [[H3588]] they may offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and grain offerings, [[H4503]] I will not [[H369]] accept them. [[H7521]] Instead, [[H3588]] I [[H595]] will finish them off [[H3615]] by sword [[H2719]] and famine [[H7458]] and plague.” [[H1698]] 
13 “Ah, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD!” [[H3069]] I replied, [[H559]] “Look, [[H2009]] the prophets [[H5030]] are telling them, [[H559]] ‘You will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] the sword [[H2719]] or suffer [[H1961]] famine, [[H7458]] but [[H3588]] I will give [[H5414]] you  lasting [[H571]] peace [[H7965]] in this [[H2088]] place.’” [[H4725]] 
14 “The prophets [[H5030]] are prophesying [[H5012]] lies [[H8267]] in My name,” [[H8034]] the LORD [[H3068]] replied. [[H559]] “I did not [[H3808]] send them [[H7971]] [or] [[H3808]] appoint them [[H6680]] [or] [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] to them. [[H413]] They [[H1992]] are prophesying [[H5012]] to you  a false [[H8267]] vision, [[H2377]] a worthless divination, [[H7081]] the futility [[H457]] and delusion [[H8649]] of their own minds. [[H3820]] 
15 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] about [[H5921]] the prophets [[H5030]] who prophesy [[H5012]] in My name, [[H8034]] though I [[H589]] did not [[H3808]] send them, [[H7971]] and who [[H1992]] say, [[H559]] ‘No [[H3808]] sword [[H2719]] or famine [[H7458]] will touch [[H1961]] this [[H2063]] land.’ [[H776]] By sword [[H2719]] and famine [[H7458]] these very [[H1992]] prophets [[H5030]] will meet their end! [[H8552]] 
16 And the people [[H5971]] to whom [[H834]] they [[H1992]] prophesy [[H5012]] will be [[H1961]] thrown [[H7993]] into the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] because of [[H6440]] famine [[H7458]] and sword. [[H2719]] There will be no [[H369]] one to bury [[H6912]] them [[H1992]] or their [[H1992]] wives, [[H802]] their sons [[H1121]] or their daughters. [[H1323]] I will pour out [[H8210]] their own evil [[H7451]] upon them. [[H5921]] 
17 You are to speak [[H559]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] to them: [[H413]] “My eyes [[H5869]] overflow [[H3381]] with tears; [[H1832]] day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] they do not [[H408]] cease, [[H1820]] for [[H3588]] the virgin [[H1330]] daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] has been shattered [[H7665]] by a crushing [[H1419]] blow, [[H7667]] a severely [[H3966]] grievous [[H2470]] wound. [[H4347]] 
18 If [[H518]] I go out [[H3318]] to the country, [[H7704]] I see [[H2009]] those slain [[H2491]] by the sword; [[H2719]] if [[H518]] I enter [[H935]] the city, [[H5892]] I see [[H2009]] those ravaged [[H8463]] by famine! [[H7458]] For [[H3588]] both [[H1571]] prophet [[H5030]] and [[H1571]] priest [[H3548]] travel [[H5503]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] they do not [[H3808]] know.” [[H3045]] 
19 Have You rejected [[H3988]] Judah [[H3063]] completely? [[H3988]] Do You [[H5315]] despise [[H1602]] Zion? [[H6726]] Why [[H4069]] have You stricken us [[H5221]] so that we are beyond [[H369]] healing? [[H4832]] We hoped [[H6960]] for peace, [[H7965]] but no [[H369]] good has come, [[H2896]] and for the time [[H6256]] of healing, [[H4832]] but there [[H2009]] was only terror. [[H1205]] 
20 We acknowledge [[H3045]] our wickedness, [[H7562]] O LORD, [[H3068]] the guilt [[H5771]] of our fathers; [[H1]] indeed, [[H3588]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against You.  
21 For the sake of [[H4616]] Your name [[H8034]] do not [[H408]] despise us; [[H5006]] do not [[H408]] disgrace [[H5034]] Your glorious [[H3519]] throne. [[H3678]] Remember [[H2142]] Your covenant [[H1285]] with us; [[H854]] do not [[H408]] break it. [[H6565]] 
22 Can [[H3426]] the worthless idols [[H1892]] of the nations [[H1471]] bring rain? [[H1652]] Do the skies alone [[H8064]] send [[H5414]] showers? [[H7241]] Is this not [[H3808]] by You, [[H859]] O LORD [[H3068]] our God? [[H430]] So we put our hope in You, [[H6960]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] have done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these things. [[H428]]
