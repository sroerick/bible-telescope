# Deuteronomy 24
[[Deuteronomy 23|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 25|→]]
1 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] marries [[H1166]] a woman, [[H802]] but [[H518]] she becomes displeasing [[H3808]] to him because [[H3588]] he finds [[H4672]] some [[H1697]] indecency [[H6172]] in her,  he may write [[H3789]] her  a certificate [[H5612]] of divorce, [[H3748]] hand it to [[H5414]] her, [[H3027]] and send her away [[H7971]] from his house. [[H1004]] 
2 If, after leaving [[H3318]] his house, [[H1004]] she goes [[H1980]] and becomes [[H1961]] another [[H312]] man’s wife, [[H376]] 
3 and the second [[H314]] man [[H376]] hates her, [[H8130]] writes [[H3789]] her  a certificate [[H5612]] of divorce, [[H3748]] hands it to [[H5414]] her, [[H3027]] and sends her away [[H7971]] from his house, [[H1004]] or [[H176]] if [[H3588]] he dies, [[H4191]] 
4 the husband [[H1167]] who [[H834]] divorced her [[H7971]] first [[H7223]] may [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] marry [[H3947]] her again [[H7725]] after [[H310]] she has been defiled, [[H2930]] for [[H3588]] that [is] [[H1931]] an abomination [[H8441]] to [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] You must not [[H3808]] bring sin [[H2398]] upon the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you as an inheritance. [[H5159]] 
5 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] is newly [[H2319]] married, [[H3947]] he must not [[H3808]] be sent [[H3318]] to war [[H6635]] or [[H3808]] be pressed into [[H5674]] any [[H3605]] duty. [[H1697]] For one [[H259]] year [[H8141]] he is [[H1961]] free [[H5355]] to stay at home [[H1004]] and bring joy [[H8055]] to the wife [[H802]] he has married. [[H3947]] 
6 Do not [[H3808]] take a pair of millstones [[H7347]] or even an upper millstone [[H7393]] as security for a debt, [[H2254]] because [[H3588]] that would be [[H1931]] taking one’s livelihood [[H5315]] as security. [[H2254]] 
7 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] is caught [[H4672]] kidnapping [[H1589]] one [[H5315]] of his Israelite [[H1121]] brothers, [[H251]] whether he treats him as a slave [[H6014]] or sells him, [[H4376]] the [[H1931]] kidnapper [[H1590]] must die. [[H4191]] You must purge [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] from among you. [[H7130]] 
8 In cases of infectious [[H5061]] skin diseases, [[H6883]] be careful [[H8104]] to diligently [[H8104]] follow [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] the Levitical [[H3881]] priests [[H3548]] instruct [[H3384]] you. [[H853]] Be careful [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] I have commanded them. [[H6680]] 
9 Remember [[H2142]] what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] did [[H6213]] to Miriam [[H4813]] on the journey [[H1870]] after you had left [[H3318]] Egypt. [[H4714]] 
10 When [[H3588]] you lend [[H5383]] anything [[H4859]] to your neighbor, [[H7453]] do not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] his house [[H1004]] to collect [[H5670]] security. [[H5667]] 
11 You are to stand [[H5975]] outside [[H2351]] while the man [[H376]] to whom [[H859]] you are lending [[H5383]] brings [[H3318]] the security [[H5667]] out [[H2351]] to you. [[H413]] 
12 If [[H518]] he [[H1931]] is a poor [[H6041]] man, [[H376]] you must not [[H3808]] go to sleep [[H7901]] with the security {in your possession}; [[H5667]] 
13 be sure to return [[H7725]] [it] [[H5667]] to him  by sunset, [[H935]] so that he may sleep [[H7901]] in his own cloak [[H8008]] and bless you, [[H1288]] and this will be [[H1961]] credited to you as righteousness [[H6666]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
14 Do not [[H3808]] oppress [[H6231]] a hired hand [[H7916]] who is poor [[H6041]] and needy, [[H34]] [whether] he is a brother [[H251]] or [[H176]] a foreigner residing [[H1616]] in one of your towns. [[H8179]] 
15 You are to pay [[H5414]] his wages [[H7939]] each day [[H3117]] before [[H3808]] sunset, [[H8121]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is poor [[H6041]] and depends [[H5375]] on them. [[H413]] Otherwise [[H3808]] he may cry out [[H7121]] to the LORD [[H3068]] against you, [[H5921]] and you will be guilty of sin. [[H2399]] 
16 Fathers [[H1]] shall not [[H3808]] be put to death [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] their children, [[H1121]] nor children [[H1121]] for [[H5921]] their fathers; [[H1]] each [[H376]] is to die [[H4191]] for his own sin. [[H2399]] 
17 Do not [[H3808]] deny [[H5186]] justice [[H4941]] to the foreigner [[H1616]] or the fatherless, [[H3490]] and do not [[H3808]] take a widow’s [[H490]] cloak [[H899]] as security. [[H2254]] 
18 Remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] you were [[H1961]] slaves [[H5650]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] redeemed you [[H6299]] from that place. [[H8033]] Therefore [[H5921]] I [[H595]] am commanding [[H6680]] you to do [[H6213]] this. [[H2088]] 
19 If [[H3588]] you are harvesting [[H7114]] in your field [[H7704]] and forget [[H7911]] a sheaf [[H6016]] [there], [[H7704]] do not [[H3808]] go back [[H7725]] to get it. [[H3947]] It is [[H1961]] to be left for the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow, [[H490]] so that [[H4616]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] may bless [[H1288]] you in all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of your hands. [[H3027]] 
20 When [[H3588]] you beat [[H2251]] the olives from your trees, [[H2132]] you must not [[H3808]] go over [[H6286]] the branches again. [[H310]] What remains will be [[H1961]] for the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow. [[H490]] 
21 When [[H3588]] you gather the grapes [[H1219]] of your vineyard, [[H3754]] you must not [[H3808]] go over [the vines] [[H5953]] again. [[H310]] What remains will be [[H1961]] for the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow. [[H490]] 
22 Remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] you were [[H1961]] slaves [[H5650]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] Therefore [[H5921]] I [[H595]] am commanding [[H6680]] you to do [[H6213]] this. [[H2088]]
