# Deuteronomy 34
[[Deuteronomy 33|←]] • [[Joshua 1|→]]
1 Then Moses [[H4872]] went up [[H5927]] from the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] to [[H413]] Mount [[H2022]] Nebo, [[H5015]] to the top [[H7218]] of Pisgah, [[H6449]] which [[H834]] faces [[H5921]] Jericho. [[H3405]] And the LORD [[H3068]] showed him [[H7200]] the whole [[H3605]] land— [[H776]] from Gilead [[H1568]] as far [[H5704]] as Dan, [[H1835]] 
2 all [[H3605]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] the land [[H776]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] as far as [[H5704]] the Western [[H314]] Sea, [[H3220]] 
3 the Negev [[H5045]] and the region [[H3603]] from the Valley [[H1237]] of Jericho, [[H3405]] the City [[H5892]] of Palms, [[H8558]] [and] all the way [[H5704]] to Zoar. [[H6820]] 
4 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “This [[H2063]] is the land [[H776]] I swore to give [[H7650]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob, [[H3290]] when I said, [[H559]] ‘I will give [[H5414]] it to your descendants.’ [[H2233]] I have let you see [[H7200]] it with your own eyes, [[H5869]] but you will not [[H3808]] cross into it.” [[H5674]] 
5 So Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] died [[H4191]] there [[H8033]] in the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] as [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said. [[H6310]] 
6 And He buried [[H6912]] him [[H853]] in a valley [[H1516]] in the land [[H776]] of Moab [[H4124]] facing [[H4136]] Beth-peor, [[H1047]] and no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] knows [[H3045]] the location of his grave. [[H6900]] 
7 Moses [was] [[H4872]] a hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he died, [[H4194]] yet his eyes [[H5869]] were not [[H3808]] weak, [[H3543]] and his vitality [[H3893]] had not [[H3808]] diminished. [[H5127]] 
8 The Israelites [[H1121]] grieved [[H1058]] for Moses [[H4872]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] thirty [[H7970]] days, [[H3117]] until the time [[H3117]] of weeping [[H1065]] and mourning [[H60]] for Moses [[H4872]] came to an end. [[H8552]] 
9 Now Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] was filled [[H4392]] with the spirit [[H7307]] of wisdom [[H2451]] because [[H3588]] Moses [[H4872]] had laid [[H5564]] his hands [[H3027]] on him. [[H5921]] So the Israelites [[H1121]] obeyed [[H8085]] him [[H413]] and did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
10 Since that time, [[H5750]] no [[H3808]] prophet [[H5030]] has arisen [[H6965]] in Israel [[H3478]] like Moses, [[H4872]] whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] knew [[H3045]] face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face [[H6440]] 
11 in all [[H3605]] the signs [[H226]] and wonders [[H4159]] the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] him to do [[H6213]] against the land [[H776]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] to Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his officials [[H5650]] and all [[H3605]] his land— [[H776]] 
12 and in all [[H3605]] the mighty [[H2389]] acts of power [[H3027]] and terrifying deeds [[H4172]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] performed [[H6213]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]
