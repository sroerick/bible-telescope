# Deuteronomy 20
[[Deuteronomy 19|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 21|→]]
1 When [[H3588]] you go out [[H3318]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] your enemies [[H341]] and see [[H7200]] horses, [[H5483]] chariots, [[H7393]] and an army [[H5971]] larger [[H7227]] than yours, [[H4480]] do not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them; [[H1992]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who brought you [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] is with you. [[H5973]] 
2 When you are about to [[H1961]] go [[H7126]] into [[H413]] battle, [[H4421]] the priest [[H3548]] is to come forward [[H5066]] and address [[H1696]] the army, [[H5971]] 
3 saying [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Hear, [[H8085]] O Israel, [[H3478]] today [[H3117]] you [[H859]] are going [[H7131]] into battle [[H4421]] with [[H5921]] your enemies. [[H341]] Do not [[H408]] be fainthearted [[H7401]] [or] [[H408]] be afraid; [[H3372]] do not [[H408]] be alarmed [[H2648]] or terrified [[H6206]] because of them. [[H6440]] 
4 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] [is] He who goes [[H1980]] with you [[H5973]] to fight [[H3898]] for you  against [[H5973]] your enemies, [[H341]] to give you the victory.” [[H3467]] 
5 Furthermore, the officers [[H7860]] are to address [[H1696]] the army, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] “Has any [[H4310]] man [[H376]] built [[H1129]] a new [[H2319]] house [[H1004]] and not [[H3808]] dedicated it? [[H2596]] Let him return [[H1980]] home, [[H1004]] or [[H6435]] he may die [[H4191]] in battle [[H4421]] and another [[H312]] man [[H376]] dedicate it. [[H2596]] 
6 Has any [[H4310]] man [[H376]] planted [[H5193]] a vineyard [[H3754]] and not [[H3808]] begun to enjoy its fruit? [[H2490]] Let him return [[H1980]] home, [[H1004]] or [[H6435]] he may die [[H4191]] in battle [[H4421]] and another [[H312]] man [[H376]] enjoy its fruit. [[H2490]] 
7 Has any [[H4310]] man [[H376]] become pledged [[H781]] to a woman [[H802]] and not [[H3808]] married her? [[H3947]] Let him return [[H1980]] home, [[H1004]] or [[H6435]] he may die [[H4191]] in battle [[H4421]] and another [[H312]] man [[H376]] marry her.” [[H3947]] 
8 Then the officers [[H7860]] shall speak [[H1696]] further [[H3254]] to [[H413]] the army, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] “Is any [[H4310]] man [[H376]] afraid [[H3373]] or fainthearted? [[H7390]] Let him return [[H1980]] home, [[H1004]] so that the hearts [[H3824]] of his brothers [[H251]] will not [[H3808]] melt [[H4549]] like his own.” [[H3824]] 
9 When the officers [[H7860]] have finished [[H3615]] addressing [[H1696]] the army, [[H5971]] they are to appoint [[H6485]] commanders [[H8269]] to lead it. [[H7218]] 
10 When [[H3588]] you approach [[H7126]] a city [[H5892]] to fight [[H3898]] against it, [[H5921]] you are to make an offer [[H7121]] of peace. [[H7965]] 
11 If [[H518]] they accept [[H6030]] your offer of peace [[H7965]] and open [their gates], [[H6605]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] [there] [[H4672]] will become [[H1961]] forced laborers [[H4522]] to serve you. [[H5647]] 
12 But if [[H518]] they refuse [[H3808]] to make peace [[H7999]] with you [[H5973]] and wage [[H6213]] war [[H4421]] against you, [[H5973]] lay siege [[H6696]] to [that city]. [[H5921]] 
13 When the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has delivered it [[H5414]] into your hands, [[H3027]] you must strike down [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2138]] with the sword. [[H2719]] 
14 But [[H7535]] the women, [[H802]] children, [[H2945]] livestock, [[H929]] and whatever [[H3605]] else is [[H1961]] in the city— [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] its spoil— [[H7998]] you may take as plunder, [[H962]] and you shall use [[H398]] the spoil [[H7998]] of your enemies [[H341]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] gives you. [[H5414]] 
15 This is how [[H3651]] you are to treat [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] that are far away [[H7350]] from you [[H4480]] and do not [[H3808]] belong to the [[H428]] nations nearby. [[H1471]] 
16 However, [[H7535]] in the cities [[H5892]] of the [[H428]] nations [[H5971]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you  as an inheritance, [[H5159]] you must not leave alive [[H2421]] anything [[H3605]] that breathes. [[H5397]] 
17 You must completely destroy [[H2763]] them— [[H2763]] the Hittites [[H2850]] and the Amorites, [[H567]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] and the Perizzites, [[H6522]] the Hivites [[H2340]] and the Jebusites— [[H2983]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has commanded you, [[H6680]] 
18 so that [[H4616]] they cannot [[H3808]] teach [[H3925]] you to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the detestable things [[H8441]] they do [[H6213]] for their gods [[H430]] [and] cause you to sin [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
19 When [[H3588]] you lay siege [[H6696]] to [[H413]] a city [[H5892]] for an extended [[H7227]] time [[H3117]] while fighting [[H3898]] against it [[H5921]] to capture it, [[H8610]] you must not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] its trees [[H6086]] by putting [[H5080]] an ax [[H1631]] to them, [[H5921]] because [[H3588]] you can eat their fruit. [[H398]] You must not [[H3808]] cut them down. [[H3772]] Are the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] human, [[H120]] that you should besiege them? [[H4692]] 
20 But [[H7535]] you may destroy [[H7843]] the trees [[H6086]] that [[H834]] you know [[H3045]] do not [[H3808]] produce fruit. [[H3978]] [Use them] [[H3772]] to build [[H1129]] siege works [[H4692]] against [[H5921]] the city [[H5892]] that [[H834]] is waging [[H6213]] war [[H4421]] against you, [[H5973]] until [[H5704]] it falls.
