# Deuteronomy 4
[[Deuteronomy 3|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 5|→]]
1 Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H6258]] O Israel, [[H3478]] the statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] I [[H595]] am teaching [[H3925]] you [[H853]] to follow [[H6213]] so that [[H4616]] you may live, [[H2421]] enter, [[H935]] and take possession of [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] is giving you. [[H5414]] 
2 You must not [[H3808]] add [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] or subtract [[H1639]] from [[H4480]] what [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you, [[H853]] so that you may keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] I [[H595]] am giving you. [[H6680]] 
3 Your eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] did [[H6213]] at Baal-peor, [[H1187]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] destroyed [[H8045]] from among you [[H7130]] all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] followed [[H1980]] Baal of Peor. [[H1187]] 
4 But you [[H859]] who held fast [[H1695]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] [are] alive [[H2416]] to this day, [[H3117]] every one of you. [[H3605]] 
5 See, [[H7200]] I have taught [[H3925]] you [[H853]] statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] has commanded me, [[H6680]] so that you may follow [[H6213]] them in [[H7130]] the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are about to enter [[H935]] and possess. [[H3423]] 
6 Observe them [[H6213]] carefully, [[H8104]] for [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] will show your wisdom [[H2451]] and understanding [[H998]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the peoples, [[H5971]] who [[H834]] shall hear [[H8085]] of all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] statutes [[H2706]] and say, [[H559]] “Surely [[H7535]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] nation [[H1471]] [is] a wise [[H2450]] and understanding [[H995]] people. [[H5971]] 
7 For [[H3588]] what [[H4310]] nation [[H1471]] [is so] great [[H1419]] as to have [[H834]] a god [[H430]] [as] near [[H7138]] to them [[H413]] as the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] is to us whenever [[H3605]] we call [[H7121]] on Him? [[H413]] 
8 And what [[H4310]] nation [[H1471]] [is so] great [[H1419]] as to have righteous [[H6662]] statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] like this [[H2063]] entire [[H3605]] law [[H8451]] I [[H595]] set [[H5414]] before you today? [[H6440]] 
9 Only [[H7535]] be on your guard [[H8104]] and diligently [[H3966]] watch [[H8104]] yourselves, [[H5315]] so that you do not [[H6435]] forget [[H7911]] the things [[H1697]] your eyes [[H5869]] have seen, [[H7200]] and so that they do not [[H6435]] slip [[H5493]] from your heart [[H3824]] as [[H3605]] long as you live. [[H2416]] Teach [[H3045]] them to your children [[H1121]] and grandchildren. [[H1121]] 
10 The day [[H3117]] you stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] at Horeb, [[H2722]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Gather [[H6950]] the people [[H5971]] before Me [[H853]] to hear [[H8085]] My words, [[H1697]] so that [[H834]] they may learn [[H3925]] to fear [[H3372]] Me [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] they [[H1992]] live [[H2416]] on [[H5921]] the earth, [[H127]] and that [[H853]] they may teach them [[H3925]] to their children. [[H1121]] 
11 You came near [[H7126]] and stood [[H5975]] at the foot [[H8478]] of the mountain, [[H2022]] a mountain [[H2022]] blazing [[H1197]] with fire [[H784]] to [[H5704]] the heavens, [[H8064]] with black clouds [[H6051]] and deep [[H6205]] darkness. [[H2822]] 
12 And the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to you [[H413]] out of [[H8432]] the fire. [[H784]] You [[H859]] heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the words, [[H1697]] but saw [[H7200]] no [[H369]] form; [[H8544]] there was only [[H2108]] a voice. [[H6963]] 
13 He declared [[H5046]] to you [[H853]] His covenant, [[H1285]] the Ten [[H6235]] Commandments [[H1697]] He commanded [[H6680]] you to follow, [[H6213]] which He wrote [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] tablets [[H3871]] of stone. [[H68]] 
14 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded me [[H6680]] to teach [[H3925]] you [[H853]] the statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] you are to follow [[H6213]] in the land [[H776]] into which [[H8033]] you [[H859]] are crossing [[H5674]] to possess. [[H3423]] 
15 So since [[H3588]] you saw [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] form [[H8544]] of any kind [[H3605]] on the day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to you [[H413]] out of [[H8432]] the fire [[H784]] at Horeb, [[H2722]] be careful [[H8104]] 
16 that you do not [[H6435]] act corruptly [[H7843]] and make [[H6213]] an idol [[H6459]] for yourselves  of any form [[H8544]] or [[H3605]] shape, [[H5566]] whether in the likeness [[H8403]] of a male [[H2145]] or [[H176]] female, [[H5347]] 
17 of any [[H3605]] beast [[H929]] on the earth [[H776]] or bird [[H6833]] that [[H834]] flies [[H5774]] in the air, [[H8064]] 
18 [or] [[H8403]] of any [[H3605]] creature that crawls [[H7430]] on the ground [[H127]] or [[H3605]] fish [[H1710]] in the waters [[H4325]] below. [[H8478]] 
19 When you look [[H5375]] to the heavens [[H8064]] and see [[H7200]] the sun [[H8121]] and [[H853]] moon [[H3394]] and stars— [[H3556]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven— [[H8064]] do not [[H6435]] be enticed [[H5080]] to bow down [[H7812]] and worship [[H5647]] what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has apportioned [[H2505]] to all [[H3605]] the nations [[H5971]] under [[H8478]] heaven. [[H8064]] 
20 Yet the LORD [[H3068]] has taken [[H3947]] you [[H853]] and brought [[H3318]] you [[H853]] out of the iron [[H1270]] furnace, [[H3564]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] to be [[H1961]] the people [[H5971]] of His inheritance, [[H5159]] as you are today. [[H3117]] 
21 The LORD, however, [[H3068]] was angry [[H599]] with me [[H5921]] on account of you, [[H1697]] and He swore [[H7650]] that I would not [[H1115]] cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] and enter [[H935]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you  as an inheritance. [[H5159]] 
22 For I will not [[H369]] be crossing [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] because [[H3588]] I [[H595]] must die [[H4191]] in this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]] But you [[H859]] shall cross over [[H5674]] and take possession of [[H3423]] that [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land. [[H776]] 
23 Be careful [[H8104]] that you do not [[H6435]] forget [[H7911]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] that [[H834]] He made [[H3772]] with you; [[H5973]] do not make [[H6213]] an idol [[H6459]] for yourselves  in the form [[H8544]] of anything [[H3605]] He [[H3068]] has forbidden you. [[H6680]] 
24 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is a consuming [[H398]] fire, [[H784]] a jealous [[H7067]] God. [[H410]] 
25 After [[H3588]] you have [[H3205]] children [[H1121]] and grandchildren [[H1121]] and you have been in the land [[H776]] a long time, [[H3462]] if you then act corruptly [[H7843]] and make [[H6213]] an idol [[H6459]] in the form [[H8544]] of anything, [[H3605]] doing [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] [and] provoking Him to anger, [[H3707]] 
26 I call heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] as witnesses [[H5749]] against you this day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] you will quickly [[H4118]] perish [[H6]] from [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are crossing [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to possess. [[H3423]] You will not [[H3808]] live long [[H748]] upon it, [[H5921]] but [[H3588]] will be utterly destroyed. [[H8045]] 
27 Then the LORD [[H3068]] will scatter [[H6327]] you among the peoples, [[H5971]] and only a few of you [[H4962]] will survive [[H7604]] among the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] will drive you. [[H5090]] 
28 And there [[H8033]] you will serve [[H5647]] man-made [[H4639]] gods [[H430]] of wood [[H6086]] and stone, [[H68]] which [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] [or] [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] [or] [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] [or] [[H3808]] smell. [[H7306]] 
29 But if from there [[H8033]] you will seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] you will find [[H4672]] Him [[H3588]] if you seek [[H1875]] Him with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and all [[H3605]] your soul. [[H5315]] 
30 When you are in distress [[H6862]] and all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] have happened to you, [[H4672]] then in later [[H319]] days [[H3117]] you will return [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and listen [[H8085]] to His voice. [[H6963]] 
31 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] [is] a merciful [[H7349]] God; [[H410]] He will not [[H3808]] abandon you [[H7503]] [or] [[H3808]] destroy you [[H7843]] [or] [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] the covenant [[H1285]] with your fathers, [[H1]] which [[H834]] He swore to them by oath. [[H7650]] 
32 Indeed, [[H3588]] ask [[H7592]] now [[H4994]] from one end [[H7097]] of the heavens [[H8064]] to [[H5704]] [the other] [[H7097]] about the days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] long [[H7223]] preceded [[H1961]] you, [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] created [[H1254]] man [[H120]] on [[H5921]] earth: [[H776]] Has anything as [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] as this [[H1697]] ever happened [[H1961]] or [[H176]] been reported? [[H8085]] 
33 Has a people [[H5971]] ever heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of God [[H430]] speaking [[H1696]] out of [[H8432]] the fire, [[H784]] as [[H834]] you [[H859]] have, [[H8085]] and lived? [[H2421]] 
34 Or [[H176]] has any god [[H430]] tried [[H5254]] to take [[H3947]] as his own  a nation [[H1471]] out of [[H7130]] another nation— [[H1471]] by trials, [[H4531]] signs, [[H226]] wonders, [[H4159]] and war, [[H4421]] by a strong [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] and an outstretched [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] and by great [[H1419]] terrors— [[H4172]] as [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] did [[H6213]] for you in Egypt, [[H4714]] before your eyes? [[H5869]] 
35 You [[H859]] were shown [these things] [[H7200]] so that you would know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is God; [[H430]] there is no [[H369]] other [[H5750]] besides Him. [[H905]] 
36 He let you hear [[H8085]] His voice [[H6963]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] to discipline you, [[H3256]] and on [[H5921]] earth [[H776]] He showed [[H7200]] you [[H853]] His great [[H1419]] fire, [[H784]] and you heard [[H8085]] His words [[H1697]] out of [[H8432]] the fire. [[H784]] 
37 Because [[H8478]] He loved [[H157]] your fathers, [[H1]] He chose [[H977]] their descendants [[H2233]] after them [[H310]] and brought you [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] by His presence [[H6440]] and great [[H1419]] power, [[H3581]] 
38 to drive out [[H3423]] before you [[H4480]] nations [[H1471]] greater [[H1419]] and mightier [than you], [[H6099]] and to bring you [[H935]] into their land [[H776]] and give it [[H5414]] as your  inheritance, [[H5159]] as it is today. [[H3117]] 
39 Know therefore [[H3045]] this day [[H3117]] and take [[H7725]] to [[H413]] heart [[H3824]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is God [[H430]] in heaven [[H8064]] above [[H4605]] and on [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] below; [[H8478]] there is no [[H369]] other. [[H5750]] 
40 Keep [[H8104]] His statutes [[H2706]] and commandments, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] am giving you today, [[H6680]] so that [[H834]] you and your children [[H1121]] after you [[H310]] may prosper, [[H3190]] and that [[H4616]] you may live long [[H748]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you for all time.” [[H3605]] 
41 Then [[H227]] Moses [[H4872]] set aside [[H914]] three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to the east [[H4217]] 
42 to which [[H8033]] a manslayer [[H7523]] could flee [[H5127]] after killing [[H7523]] his neighbor [[H7453]] unintentionally [[H1097]] without [[H3808]] prior [[H4480]] malice. [[H8130]] To save his own life, [[H2425]] he could flee [[H5127]] to [[H413]] one [[H259]] of these [[H411]] cities: [[H5892]] 
43 Bezer [[H1221]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] on the plateau [[H4334]] belonging to the Reubenites, [[H7206]] Ramoth [[H7216]] in Gilead [[H1568]] belonging to the Gadites, [[H1425]] or Golan [[H1474]] in Bashan [[H1316]] belonging to the Manassites. [[H4520]] 
44 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] Moses [[H4872]] set [[H7760]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
45 These [are] [[H428]] the testimonies, [[H5713]] statutes, [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] Moses [[H4872]] proclaimed [[H1696]] to [[H413]] them [[H1121]] after they had come out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] 
46 while they were in the valley [[H1516]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] facing [[H4136]] Beth-peor [[H1047]] in the land [[H776]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] who [[H834]] lived [[H3427]] in Heshbon [[H2809]] and was defeated [[H5221]] by Moses [[H4872]] and the Israelites [[H1121]] after they had come out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
47 They took possession of [[H3423]] his land [[H776]] and the land [[H776]] of Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan— [[H1316]] the two [[H8147]] Amorite [[H567]] kings [[H4428]] who [[H834]] were across [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to the east— [[H4217]] 
48 extending from Aroer [[H6177]] on [[H5921]] the rim [[H8193]] of the Arnon [[H769]] Valley [[H5158]] as far as [[H5704]] Mount [[H2022]] Siyon [[H7865]] (that is, [[H1931]] Hermon), [[H2768]] 
49 including all [[H3605]] the Arabah [[H6160]] on the east [[H4217]] side [[H5676]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] and as far as [[H5704]] the sea [[H3220]] of the Arabah, [[H6160]] below [[H8478]] the slopes [[H794]] of Pisgah. [[H6449]]
