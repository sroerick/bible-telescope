# Deuteronomy 15
[[Deuteronomy 14|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 16|→]]
1 At the end [[H7093]] of every seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] you must cancel debts. [[H8059]] 
2 This [[H2088]] is the manner [[H1697]] of remission: [[H8059]] Every [[H3605]] creditor [[H1167]] shall cancel [[H8058]] what [[H834]] he has loaned [[H5383]] his neighbor. [[H7453]] He is not [[H3808]] to collect [[H5065]] anything [[H853]] from his neighbor [[H7453]] or brother, [[H251]] because [[H3588]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] time of release [[H8059]] has been proclaimed. [[H7121]] 
3 You may collect [[H5065]] something from a foreigner, [[H5237]] but you [[H3027]] must forgive [[H8058]] whatever [[H834]] your brother [[H251]] owes you. [[H1961]] 
4 There will be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] poor among you, [[H34]] however, [[H657]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will surely bless you [[H1288]] in the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you  to possess [[H3423]] as an inheritance, [[H5159]] 
5 if [[H518]] only [[H7535]] you obey [[H8085]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and are careful [[H8104]] to follow [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2063]] commandments [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving you today. [[H6680]] 
6 When the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] blesses you [[H1288]] as [[H834]] He has promised, [[H1696]] you will lend [[H5670]] to many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] but borrow [[H5670]] from none; [[H3808]] you will rule [[H4910]] over many [[H7227]] nations, [[H1471]] but be ruled [[H4910]] by none. [[H3808]] 
7 If [[H3588]] there is [[H1961]] a poor man [[H34]] among  your brothers [[H251]] within any [[H259]] of the gates [[H8179]] in the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you, [[H5414]] you are not [[H3808]] to harden [[H553]] your heart [[H3824]] [or] [[H3808]] shut [[H7092]] your hand [[H3027]] from your poor [[H34]] brother. [[H251]] 
8 Instead, [[H3588]] you are to open [[H6605]] your hand [[H3027]] to him  and freely loan [[H5670]] him [[H5670]] whatever [[H1767]] he needs. [[H4270]] 
9 Be careful [[H8104]] not to harbor [[H6435]] this wicked [[H1100]] thought [[H1697]] in [[H5973]] your heart, [[H3824]] “The seventh [[H7651]] year, [[H8141]] the year [[H8141]] of release, [[H8059]] is near,” [[H7126]] so that you look upon [[H5869]] your poor [[H34]] brother [[H251]] begrudgingly [[H7489]] and give him [[H5414]] nothing. [[H3808]] He will cry out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] against you, [[H5921]] and you will be [[H1961]] guilty of sin. [[H2399]] 
10 Give generously [[H5414]] to him,  and do not [[H3808]] let your heart [[H3824]] be grieved [[H7489]] [when you do so]. [[H5414]] And because of [[H1558]] this [[H2088]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] will bless [[H1288]] you in all [[H3605]] your work [[H4639]] and in everything [[H3605]] to which you put [[H4916]] your hand. [[H3027]] 
11 For [[H3588]] there will never [[H3808]] cease [[H2308]] to be poor [[H34]] in [[H7130]] the land; [[H776]] that is why [[H5921]] I [[H595]] am commanding you [[H6680]] to [[H559]] open [[H6605]] wide [[H6605]] your hand [[H3027]] to your brother [[H251]] and to the poor [[H6041]] and needy [[H34]] in your land. [[H776]] 
12 If [[H3588]] a fellow [[H251]] Hebrew, [[H5680]] a man or [[H176]] a woman, [[H5680]] sells himself [[H4376]] to you  and serves you [[H5647]] six [[H8337]] years, [[H8141]] in the seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] you must set [[H7971]] him free. [[H2670]] 
13 And when [[H3588]] you release him, [[H7971]] do not [[H3808]] send him away [[H7971]] empty-handed. [[H7387]] 
14 You are to furnish [[H6059]] him liberally [[H6059]] from your flock, [[H6629]] your threshing floor, [[H1637]] and your winepress. [[H3342]] You shall give [[H5414]] to him  as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has blessed you. [[H1288]] 
15 Remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] you were [[H1961]] slaves [[H5650]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] redeemed you; [[H6299]] that is why [[H5921]] I [[H595]] am giving [[H6680]] you [[H853]] this [[H2088]] command [[H1697]] today. [[H3117]] 
16 But if [[H3588]] your servant says [[H559]] to you, [[H413]] ‘I do not [[H3808]] want to leave you,’ [[H3318]] because [[H3588]] he loves [[H157]] you [[H853]] and your household [[H1004]] and [[H3588]] is well off [[H2895]] with you, [[H5973]] 
17 take [[H3947]] an awl [[H4836]] and pierce [it] [[H5414]] through his ear [[H241]] into the door, [[H1817]] and he will become [[H1961]] your  servant [[H5650]] for life. [[H5769]] And [[H637]] treat [[H6213]] your maidservant [[H519]] the same way. [[H3651]] 
18 Do not [[H3808]] regard it [[H5869]] as a hardship [[H7185]] to set [[H7971]] [your servant] [[H853]] free, [[H2670]] because [[H3588]] his six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] of service [[H5647]] were worth twice [[H4932]] the wages [[H7939]] of a hired hand. [[H7916]] And the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will bless you [[H1288]] in all [[H3605]] you do. [[H6213]] 
19 You must set apart [[H6942]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H1060]] male [[H2145]] produced [[H3205]] by your herds [[H1241]] and flocks. [[H6629]] You are not [[H3808]] to put the firstborn [[H1060]] of your oxen [[H7794]] to work [[H5647]] [or] [[H3808]] shear [[H1494]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of your flock. [[H6629]] 
20 Each year [[H8141]] you [[H859]] and your household [[H1004]] are to eat it [[H398]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] will choose. [[H977]] 
21 But if [[H3588]] [an animal] has [[H1961]] a defect, [[H3971]] is lame [[H6455]] or [[H176]] blind, [[H5787]] or has any [[H3605]] serious [[H7451]] flaw, [[H3971]] you must not [[H3808]] sacrifice [[H2076]] it to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
22 Eat it [[H398]] within your gates; [[H8179]] both [[H3162]] the unclean [[H2931]] person and the clean [may eat it] [[H2889]] as if it were a gazelle [[H6643]] or deer. [[H354]] 
23 But [[H7535]] you must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the blood; [[H1818]] pour [[H8210]] it on [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] like water. [[H4325]]
