# Deuteronomy 25
[[Deuteronomy 24|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 26|→]]
1 If [[H3588]] there is [[H1961]] a dispute [[H7379]] between [[H996]] men, [[H582]] they are to go [[H5066]] to [[H413]] court [[H4941]] to be judged, [[H8199]] so that the innocent [[H6662]] may be acquitted [[H6663]] and the guilty [[H7563]] condemned. [[H7561]] 
2 If [[H518]] the guilty man [[H7563]] deserves to be beaten, [[H5221]] the judge [[H8199]] shall have him lie down [[H5307]] and be flogged [[H5221]] in his presence [[H6440]] with the number [[H4557]] of lashes [[H1767]] his crime deserves. [[H7564]] 
3 He may receive [[H5221]] no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] than forty {lashes}, [[H705]] lest [[H6435]] your brother [[H251]] be beaten [[H5221]] any more [[H3254]] than [[H5921]] that [[H428]] and be degraded [[H7034]] in your sight. [[H5869]] 
4 Do not [[H3808]] muzzle [[H2629]] an ox [[H7794]] while it is treading out the grain. [[H1758]] 
5 When [[H3588]] brothers [[H251]] dwell [[H3427]] together [[H3162]] and one [[H259]] of them [[H1992]] dies [[H4191]] without [[H369]] a son, [[H1121]] the widow [[H802]] must not [[H3808]] marry [[H1961]] outside [the family]. [[H2351]] Her husband’s brother [[H2993]] is to take her [[H3947]] as his  wife [[H802]] and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law for her. [[H2992]] 
6 The first son [[H1060]] she bears [[H3205]] will carry [[H6965]] on [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of the dead [[H4191]] brother, [[H251]] so that his name [[H8034]] will not [[H3808]] be blotted out [[H4229]] from Israel. [[H3478]] 
7 But if [[H518]] the man [[H376]] does not [[H3808]] want [[H2654]] to marry [[H3947]] his brother’s widow, [[H2994]] she [[H2994]] is to go [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] at the city gate [[H8179]] and say, [[H559]] “My husband’s brother [[H2993]] refuses [[H3985]] to preserve [[H6965]] his brother’s [[H251]] name [[H8034]] in Israel. [[H3478]] He is not [[H3808]] willing [[H14]] to perform the duty of a brother-in-law for me. [[H2992]] 
8 Then the elders [[H2205]] of his city [[H5892]] shall summon [[H7121]] him  and speak [[H1696]] with him. [[H413]] If he persists [[H5975]] and says, [[H559]] “I do not [[H3808]] want [[H2654]] to marry her,” [[H3947]] 
9 his brother’s widow [[H2994]] shall go up [[H5066]] to him [[H413]] in the presence [[H5869]] of the elders, [[H2205]] remove [[H2502]] his sandal, [[H5275]] spit [[H3417]] in his face, [[H6440]] and declare, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3602]] is done [[H6213]] to the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] maintain [[H1129]] his brother’s [[H251]] line.” [[H1004]] 
10 And his family name [[H8034]] in Israel [[H3478]] will be called [[H7121]] “The House [[H1004]] of the Unsandaled.” [[H5275]] 
11 If [[H3588]] two men [[H376]] are fighting, [[H5327]] and the wife [[H802]] of one [[H259]] steps in [[H7126]] to rescue [[H5337]] her husband [[H376]] from [[H3027]] the one striking him, [[H5221]] and she reaches out [[H7971]] her hand [[H3027]] and grabs [[H2388]] his genitals, [[H4016]] 
12 you are to cut off [[H7112]] her hand. [[H3709]] You must show her no pity. [[H2347]] 
13 You shall not [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] two differing weights [[H68]] in your bag, [[H3599]] one heavy [[H1419]] and one light. [[H6996]] 
14 You shall not [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] two differing measures [[H374]] in your house, [[H1004]] a larger [[H1419]] and a smaller. [[H6996]] 
15 You must maintain [[H1961]] accurate [[H8003]] and honest [[H6664]] weights [[H68]] [and] [[H8003]] measures, [[H374]] so that [[H4616]] you may live long [[H748]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you. [[H5414]] 
16 For [[H3588]] everyone [[H3605]] who behaves [[H6213]] dishonestly [[H5766]] in regard to these things [[H428]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
17 Remember [[H2142]] what [[H834]] the Amalekites [[H6002]] did [[H6213]] to you  along your way [[H1870]] from [[H3318]] Egypt, [[H4714]] 
18 how [[H834]] they met you [[H7136]] on your journey [[H1870]] when you [[H859]] were tired [[H3023]] and weary, [[H5889]] and they attacked [[H2179]] all [[H3605]] your stragglers; [[H2826]] they had no [[H3808]] fear [[H3373]] of God. [[H430]] 
19 When the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] gives you rest [[H5117]] from [[H3605]] the enemies [[H341]] all around you [[H5439]] in the land [[H776]] [He] [[H3068]] is giving [[H5414]] you to possess [[H3423]] as an inheritance, [[H5159]] you are to blot out [[H4229]] the memory [[H2143]] of Amalek [[H6002]] from under [[H8478]] heaven. [[H8064]] Do not [[H3808]] forget! [[H7911]]
