# Deuteronomy 12
[[Deuteronomy 11|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 13|→]]
1 These [are] [[H428]] the statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] you must be careful [[H8104]] to follow [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] you [[H859]] live [[H2416]] in the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] has given [[H5414]] you to possess. [[H3423]] 
2 Destroy completely [[H6]] all [[H3605]] the places [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the nations [[H1471]] you [[H859]] are dispossessing [[H3423]] have served [[H5647]] their gods— [[H430]] atop [[H5921]] the high [[H7311]] mountains, [[H2022]] on [[H5921]] the hills, [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree. [[H6086]] 
3 Tear down [[H5422]] their altars, [[H4196]] smash [[H7665]] their sacred pillars, [[H4676]] burn up [[H8313]] their Asherah poles, [[H842]] cut down [[H1438]] the idols [[H6456]] of their gods, [[H430]] and wipe out [[H6]] their names [[H8034]] from [[H4480]] every place. [[H4725]] 
4 You shall not [[H3808]] worship [[H6213]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in this way. [[H3651]] 
5 Instead, [[H3588]] you must seek [[H1875]] the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will choose [[H977]] from among all [[H3605]] your tribes [[H7626]] to establish [[H7760]] as a dwelling [[H7933]] for His Name, [[H8034]] and there [[H8033]] you must go. [[H935]] 
6 To that place [[H8033]] you are to bring [[H935]] your burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sacrifices, [[H2077]] your tithes [[H4643]] and heave offerings, [[H8641]] your vow offerings [[H5088]] and freewill offerings, [[H5071]] as well as the firstborn [[H1062]] of your herds [[H1241]] and flocks. [[H6629]] 
7 There, [[H8033]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] [you and] your households [[H1004]] shall eat [[H398]] and rejoice [[H8055]] in all [[H3605]] you do, [[H4916]] because [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has blessed you. [[H1288]] 
8 You are not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] as [[H3605]] we [[H587]] are doing [[H6213]] here [[H6311]] today, [[H3117]] [where] everyone [[H376]] [does] what [[H3605]] seems right [[H3477]] in his own eyes. [[H5869]] 
9 For [[H3588]] you have not [[H3808]] yet [[H5704]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the resting place [[H4496]] and the inheritance [[H5159]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] is giving you. [[H5414]] 
10 When you cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] and live [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you as an inheritance, [[H5157]] and He gives you rest [[H5117]] from all [[H3605]] the enemies [[H341]] around you [[H5439]] and you live [[H3427]] in security, [[H983]] 
11 then the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will choose [[H977]] a dwelling [[H7931]] for His Name. [[H8034]] And there [[H8033]] you are to bring [[H935]] everything [[H3605]] I [[H595]] command you: [[H6680]] your burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sacrifices, [[H2077]] your tithes [[H4643]] and special gifts, [[H8641]] and all [[H3605]] the choice [[H4005]] offerings [[H5088]] you vow [[H5087]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 And you shall rejoice [[H8055]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God— [[H430]] you, [[H859]] your sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] and your menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H519]] and the Levite [[H3881]] within your gates, [[H8179]] since [[H3588]] he has no [[H369]] portion [[H2506]] or inheritance [[H5159]] among you. [[H854]] 
13 Be careful [[H8104]] not [[H6435]] to offer [[H5927]] your burnt offerings [[H5930]] in just any [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] you see; [[H7200]] 
14 you must offer [[H5927]] [them] [[H5930]] only [[H3588]] in the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] will choose [[H977]] in one [[H259]] of your tribal territories, [[H7626]] and there [[H8033]] you shall do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] command you. [[H6680]] 
15 But [[H7535]] whenever [[H3605]] you [[H5315]] wish, [[H185]] you may slaughter [[H2076]] and eat [[H398]] meat [[H1320]] within any [[H3605]] of your gates, [[H8179]] according to the blessing [[H1293]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has given you. [[H5414]] Those who are clean [[H2889]] or unclean [[H2931]] may eat it, [[H398]] as they would a gazelle [[H6643]] or deer, [[H354]] 
16 but [[H7535]] you must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the blood; [[H1818]] pour [[H8210]] it on [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] like water. [[H4325]] 
17 Within your gates [[H8179]] you must [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the tithe [[H4643]] of your grain [[H1715]] or new wine [[H8492]] or oil, [[H3323]] the firstborn [[H1062]] of your herds [[H1241]] or flocks, [[H6629]] any [[H3605]] of the offerings [[H5088]] that [[H834]] you have vowed to give, [[H5087]] or your freewill offerings [[H5071]] or special gifts. [[H8641]] 
18 Instead, [[H3588]] you must eat them [[H398]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] at the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will choose— [[H977]] you, [[H859]] your sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] your menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H519]] and the Levite [[H3881]] within your gates. [[H8179]] Rejoice [[H8055]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in all [[H3605]] you do, [[H4916]] 
19 and be careful [[H8104]] not [[H6435]] to neglect [[H5800]] the Levites [[H3881]] as [[H3605]] long as you live in [[H5921]] your land. [[H127]] 
20 When [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] expands [[H7337]] your territory [[H1366]] as [[H834]] He has promised, [[H1696]] and you [[H5315]] crave [[H183]] meat [[H1320]] and say, [[H559]] “I want to eat [[H398]] meat,” [[H1320]] you may eat [[H398]] it [[H1320]] whenever [[H3605]] you [[H5315]] want. [[H185]] 
21 If [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] chooses [[H977]] to put [[H7760]] His Name [[H8034]] is too far [[H7368]] from you, [[H4480]] you may slaughter [[H2076]] any of the herd [[H1241]] or flock [[H6629]] He [[H3068]] has given you, [[H5414]] as [[H834]] I have commanded you, [[H6680]] and you may eat [[H398]] it within your gates [[H8179]] whenever [[H3605]] you [[H5315]] want. [[H185]] 
22 Indeed, [[H389]] you may eat [[H398]] it as [[H834]] you would eat [[H398]] a gazelle [[H6643]] or deer; [[H354]] both [[H3162]] the clean [[H2889]] and the unclean [[H2931]] may eat it. [[H398]] 
23 Only [[H7535]] be sure [[H2388]] not [[H1115]] to eat [[H398]] the blood, [[H1818]] because [[H3588]] the blood [[H1818]] is the life, [[H5315]] and you must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the life [[H5315]] with [[H5973]] the meat. [[H1320]] 
24 You must not eat [the blood]; [[H398]] pour [[H8210]] it on [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] like water. [[H4325]] 
25 Do not [[H3808]] eat it, [[H398]] so that [[H4616]] it may go well [[H3190]] with you and your children [[H1121]] after you, [[H310]] because [[H3588]] you will be doing [[H6213]] what is right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
26 But [[H7535]] you are to take [[H5375]] your holy things [[H6944]] and your vow offerings [[H5088]] and go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] will choose. [[H977]] 
27 Present [[H6213]] the meat [[H1320]] and blood [[H1818]] of your burnt offerings [[H5930]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] The blood [[H1818]] of your other sacrifices [[H2077]] must be poured out [[H8210]] beside [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] but you may eat [[H398]] the meat. [[H1320]] 
28 Be careful [[H8104]] to obey [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] I [[H595]] command you, [[H6680]] so that [[H4616]] it may always go well [[H3190]] with you and your children [[H1121]] after you, [[H310]] because [[H3588]] you will be doing [[H6213]] what is good [[H2896]] and right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
29 When [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] cuts off [[H3772]] before you [[H6440]] the nations [[H1471]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to dispossess, [[H3423]] and you drive them out [[H3423]] and live [[H3427]] in their land, [[H776]] 
30 be careful [[H8104]] not [[H6435]] to be ensnared [[H5367]] by their ways [[H310]] after [[H310]] they have been destroyed [[H8045]] before you. [[H6440]] Do not [[H6435]] inquire [[H1875]] about their gods, [[H430]] asking, [[H559]] “How [[H349]] do these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] serve [[H5647]] their gods? [[H430]] I will [[H589]] do [[H6213]] likewise.” [[H1571]] 
31 You must not [[H3808]] [worship] [[H6213]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in this way, [[H3651]] because [[H3588]] they practice [[H6213]] for their gods [[H430]] every [[H3605]] abomination [[H8441]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] hates. [[H8130]] They even [[H3588]] burn [[H8313]] their sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] in the fire [[H784]] [as sacrifices] to their gods. [[H430]] 
32 See that you do [[H8104]] everything [[H3605]] I [[H595]] command you; [[H6680]] do not [[H3808]] add [[H3254]] to it [[H5921]] or subtract [[H1639]] from it. [[H4480]]
