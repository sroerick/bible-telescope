# Deuteronomy 26
[[Deuteronomy 25|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 27|→]]
1 When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you as an inheritance, [[H5159]] and you take possession of it [[H3423]] and settle [[H3427]] in it,  
2 you must take [[H3947]] some of the firstfruits [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] the produce [[H6529]] of the ground [[H127]] that [[H834]] you bring in [[H935]] from the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you  and put [them] [[H7760]] in a basket. [[H2935]] Then go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will choose [[H977]] as a dwelling [[H7931]] for His name, [[H8034]] 
3 go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] who [[H834]] is [[H1961]] serving at that [[H1992]] time, [[H3117]] and say [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “I declare [[H5046]] today [[H3117]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] that [[H3588]] I have entered [[H935]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] swore [[H7650]] to our fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] us.  
4 Then the priest [[H3548]] shall take [[H3947]] the basket [[H2935]] from your hands [[H3027]] and place it [[H3240]] before [[H6440]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] 
5 and you are to declare [[H6030]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] “My father [[H1]] was a wandering [[H6]] Aramean, [[H761]] and he went down [[H3381]] to Egypt [[H4714]] few in number [[H4592]] and lived [[H1481]] there [[H8033]] and became [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] nation, [[H1471]] mighty [[H6099]] and numerous. [[H7227]] 
6 But the Egyptians [[H4713]] mistreated us [[H7489]] and afflicted us, [[H6031]] putting us [[H5414]] to hard [[H7186]] labor. [[H5656]] 
7 So we called out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of our fathers; [[H1]] and the LORD [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] our voice [[H6963]] and saw [[H7200]] our misery, [[H6040]] toil, [[H5999]] and oppression. [[H3906]] 
8 Then the LORD [[H3068]] brought us [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] and an outstretched [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] with great [[H1419]] terror, [[H4172]] signs, [[H226]] and wonders. [[H4159]] 
9 And He brought us [[H935]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and gave [[H5414]] us this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]] 
10 And now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] I have brought [[H935]] the firstfruits [[H6529]] of the land [[H127]] that [[H834]] You, O LORD, [[H3068]] have given [[H5414]] me.”  Then you are to place [the basket] [[H3240]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and bow down [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] Him. [[H3068]] 
11 So you shall rejoice— [[H8056]] you, [[H859]] the Levite, [[H3881]] and the foreigner dwelling [[H1616]] among you— [[H7130]] in all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] things the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has given [[H5414]] to you  and your household. [[H1004]] 
12 When [[H3588]] you have finished laying aside [[H3615]] a tenth [[H4643]] of all [[H3605]] of your produce [[H8393]] in the third [[H7992]] year, [[H8141]] the year [[H8141]] of the tithe, [[H4643]] you are to give [[H5414]] it to the Levite, [[H3881]] the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow, [[H490]] that they may eat [[H398]] and be filled [[H7646]] within your gates. [[H8179]] 
13 Then you shall declare [[H559]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] “I have removed [[H1197]] from [[H4480]] [my] house [[H1004]] the sacred [portion] [[H6944]] and [[H1571]] have given it [[H5414]] to the Levite, [[H3881]] the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow, [[H490]] according to all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] You have given me. [[H6680]] I have not [[H3808]] transgressed [[H5674]] or forgotten [[H7911]] Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
14 I have not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] any of [the sacred portion] [[H4480]] while in mourning, [[H205]] or removed [[H1197]] any of it [[H4480]] while unclean, [[H2931]] or offered [[H5414]] any of [[H4480]] it for the dead. [[H4191]] I have obeyed [[H8085]] the LORD [[H3068]] my God; [[H430]] I have done [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] You commanded me. [[H6680]] 
15 Look down [[H8259]] from [[H4480]] Your holy [[H6944]] habitation, [[H4583]] from heaven, [[H8064]] and bless [[H1288]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] and the land [[H127]] You have given [[H5414]] us,  as [[H834]] You swore [[H7650]] to our fathers, [[H1]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey.” [[H1706]] 
16 The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] commands you [[H6680]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] to follow [[H6213]] these [[H428]] statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances. [[H4941]] You must be careful [[H8104]] to follow [[H6213]] them [[H853]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and all [[H3605]] your soul. [[H5315]] 
17 Today [[H3117]] you have proclaimed [[H559]] that the LORD [[H3068]] is [[H1961]] your God [[H430]] and that you will walk [[H1980]] in His ways, [[H1870]] keep [[H8104]] His statutes [[H2706]] and commandments [[H4687]] and ordinances, [[H4941]] and listen [[H8085]] to His voice. [[H6963]] 
18 And today [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] has proclaimed you [[H559]] to be [[H1961]] His  people, [[H5971]] a treasured possession [[H5459]] as [[H834]] He promised, [[H1696]] and that you are to keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] His commandments, [[H4687]] 
19 and that He will set you [[H5414]] high [[H5945]] in praise [[H8416]] and name [[H8034]] and honor [[H8597]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] He has made, [[H6213]] and that you will be [[H1961]] a holy [[H6918]] people [[H5971]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] as [[H834]] He promised.
