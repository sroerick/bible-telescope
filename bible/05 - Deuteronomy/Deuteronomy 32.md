# Deuteronomy 32
[[Deuteronomy 31|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 33|→]]
1 “Give ear, [[H238]] O heavens, [[H8064]] and I will speak; [[H1696]] hear, [[H8085]] O earth, [[H776]] the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]] 
2 Let my teaching [[H3948]] fall [[H6201]] like rain [[H4306]] and my speech [[H565]] settle [[H5140]] like dew, [[H2919]] like gentle rain [[H8164]] on [[H5921]] new grass, [[H1877]] like showers [[H7241]] on [[H5921]] tender plants. [[H6212]] 
3 For [[H3588]] I will proclaim [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Ascribe [[H3051]] greatness [[H1433]] to our God! [[H430]] 
4 [He is] the Rock, [[H6697]] His work [[H6467]] is perfect; [[H8549]] all [[H3605]] His ways [[H1870]] are just. [[H4941]] A God [[H410]] of faithfulness [[H530]] without [[H369]] injustice, [[H5766]] righteous [[H6662]] and upright [[H3477]] [is] He. [[H1931]] 
5 [His people] have acted corruptly [[H7843]] toward Him;  their spot [is] [[H3971]] not [[H3808]] that of His children, [[H1121]] but of a perverse [[H6141]] and crooked [[H6618]] generation. [[H1755]] 
6 Is this [[H2063]] how you repay [[H1580]] the LORD, [[H3068]] O foolish [[H5036]] and senseless [[H3808]] people? [[H5971]] Is He [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] your Father [[H1]] and Creator? [[H7069]] Has He not [[H1931]] made you [[H6213]] and established you? [[H3559]] 
7 Remember [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of old; [[H5769]] consider [[H995]] the years [[H8141]] long [[H1755]] past. [[H1755]] Ask [[H7592]] your father, [[H1]] and he will tell you, [[H5046]] your elders, [[H2205]] and they will inform you. [[H559]] 
8 When the Most High [[H5945]] gave the nations [[H1471]] their inheritance, [[H5157]] when He divided [[H6504]] the sons [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] He set [[H5324]] the boundaries [[H1367]] of the peoples [[H5971]] according to the number [[H4557]] of the sons [[H1121]] of God. [[H3478]] 
9 But [[H3588]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] portion [[H2506]] is His people, [[H5971]] Jacob [[H3290]] His allotted [[H2256]] inheritance. [[H5159]] 
10 He found him [[H4672]] in a desolate [[H4057]] land, [[H776]] in a barren, [[H8414]] howling [[H3214]] wilderness; [[H3452]] He surrounded him, [[H5437]] He instructed him, [[H995]] He guarded him [[H5341]] as the apple [[H380]] of His eye. [[H5869]] 
11 As an eagle [[H5404]] stirs up [[H5782]] its nest [[H7064]] and hovers [[H7363]] over [[H5921]] its young, [[H1469]] He spread [[H6566]] His wings [[H3671]] to catch them; [[H3947]] He carried them [[H5375]] on [[H5921]] His pinions. [[H84]] 
12 The LORD [[H3068]] alone [[H910]] led him, [[H5148]] and no [[H369]] foreign [[H5236]] god [[H410]] [was] with him. [[H5973]] 
13 He made him ride [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] the heights [[H1116]] of the land [[H776]] and fed him [[H398]] the produce [[H8570]] of the field. [[H7704]] He nourished [[H3243]] him with honey [[H1706]] from the rock [[H5553]] and oil [[H8081]] from the flinty [[H2496]] crag, [[H6697]] 
14 with curds [[H2529]] from the herd [[H1241]] and milk [[H2461]] from the flock, [[H6629]] with [[H5973]] the fat [[H2459]] of lambs, [[H3733]] with rams [[H352]] from Bashan, [[H1121]] and goats, [[H6260]] with [[H5973]] the choicest [[H2459]] grains [[H3629]] of wheat. [[H2406]] From the juice [[H1818]] of the finest grapes [[H6025]] you drank [[H8354]] the wine. [[H2561]] 
15 But Jeshurun [[H3484]] grew fat [[H8080]] and kicked— [[H1163]] becoming fat, [[H8080]] bloated, [[H5666]] and gorged. [[H3780]] He abandoned [[H5203]] the God [[H433]] who made him [[H6213]] and scorned [[H5034]] the Rock [[H6697]] of his salvation. [[H3444]] 
16 They provoked His jealousy [[H7065]] with foreign gods; [[H2114]] they enraged Him [[H3707]] with abominations. [[H8441]] 
17 They sacrificed [[H2076]] to demons, [[H7700]] not [[H3808]] to God, [[H433]] to gods [[H430]] they had not [[H3808]] known, [[H3045]] to newly arrived [gods], [[H2319]] which your fathers [[H1]] did not [[H3808]] fear. [[H8175]] 
18 You ignored [[H7876]] the Rock [[H6697]] who brought you forth; [[H3205]] you forgot [[H7911]] the God [[H410]] who gave you birth. [[H2342]] 
19 When the LORD [[H3068]] saw this, [[H7200]] He rejected [them], [[H5006]] provoked to anger [[H3708]] by His sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] 
20 He said: [[H559]] I will hide [[H5641]] My face from them; [[H6440]] I will see [[H7200]] what [will be] [[H4100]] their end. [[H319]] For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are a perverse [[H8419]] generation— [[H1755]] children [[H1121]] of unfaithfulness. [[H529]] 
21 They [[H1992]] have provoked My jealousy [[H7065]] by [that which is] not [[H3808]] God; [[H410]] they have enraged Me [[H3707]] with their worthless idols. [[H1892]] So I [[H589]] will make them jealous [[H7065]] by those who are not [[H3808]] a people; [[H5971]] I will make them angry [[H3707]] by a nation [[H1471]] without understanding. [[H5036]] 
22 For [[H3588]] a fire [[H784]] has been kindled [[H6919]] by My anger, [[H639]] and it burns [[H3344]] to [[H5704]] the depths [[H8482]] of Sheol; [[H7585]] it consumes [[H398]] the earth [[H776]] and its produce, [[H2981]] and scorches [[H3857]] the foundations [[H4146]] of the mountains. [[H2022]] 
23 I will heap [[H5595]] disasters [[H7451]] upon them; [[H5921]] I will spend [[H3615]] My arrows [[H2671]] against them.  
24 They will be wasted [[H4198]] from hunger, [[H7458]] ravaged [[H3898]] by pestilence [[H7565]] and bitter [[H4815]] plague; [[H6986]] I will send [[H7971]] the fangs [[H8127]] of wild beasts [[H929]] against them,  with [[H5973]] the venom [[H2534]] of vipers that slither [[H2119]] in the dust. [[H6083]] 
25 Outside, [[H2351]] the sword [[H2719]] will take their children, [[H7921]] and inside, [[H2315]] terror will strike [[H367]] the young man [[H970]] and [[H1571]] the young woman, [[H1330]] the infant [[H3243]] and [[H5973]] the gray-haired [[H7872]] man. [[H376]] 
26 I would have said [[H559]] I will cut them to pieces [[H6284]] and blot out [[H7673]] their memory [[H2143]] from mankind, [[H582]] 
27 if I had not [[H3884]] dreaded [[H1481]] the taunt [[H3708]] of the enemy, [[H341]] lest [[H6435]] their adversaries [[H6862]] misunderstand [[H5234]] and say: [[H559]] ‘Our own hand [[H3027]] has prevailed; [[H7311]] it was not [[H3808]] the LORD [[H3068]] who did [[H6466]] all [[H3605]] this.’ [[H2063]] 
28 Israel [[H1992]] is a nation [[H1471]] devoid [[H6]] of counsel [[H6098]] with no [[H369]] understanding [[H8394]] among them.  
29 If only [[H3863]] they were wise, [[H2449]] they would understand [[H7919]] it; [[H2063]] they would comprehend [[H995]] their fate. [[H319]] 
30 How [[H349]] could one man [[H259]] pursue [[H7291]] a thousand, [[H505]] or two [[H8147]] put ten thousand [[H7233]] to flight, [[H5127]] unless [[H518]] their Rock [[H6697]] had sold them, [[H4376]] unless the LORD [[H3068]] had given them up? [[H5462]] 
31 For [[H3588]] their rock [[H6697]] is not [[H3808]] like our Rock, [[H6697]] even our enemies [[H341]] concede. [[H6414]] 
32 But [[H3588]] their vine [is] [[H1612]] from the vine [[H1612]] of Sodom [[H5467]] and from the fields [[H7709]] of Gomorrah. [[H6017]] Their grapes [[H6025]] are poisonous; [[H7219]] Their  clusters [are] [[H811]] bitter. [[H4846]] 
33 Their wine [[H3196]] is the venom [[H2534]] of serpents, [[H8577]] the deadly [[H393]] poison [[H7219]] of cobras. [[H6620]] 
34 Have I not [[H3808]] stored up [[H3647]] these things, [[H1931]] sealed up [[H2856]] within My [[H5978]] vaults? [[H214]] 
35 Vengeance [[H5359]] is Mine;  I will repay. [[H8005]] In due time [[H6256]] their foot [[H7272]] will slip; [[H4131]] for [[H3588]] their day [[H3117]] of disaster [[H343]] is near, [[H7138]] and their doom [[H6264]] is coming quickly. [[H2363]] 
36 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will judge [[H1777]] His people [[H5971]] and have compassion [[H5162]] on [[H5921]] His servants [[H5650]] when [[H3588]] He sees [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] their strength [[H3027]] is gone [[H235]] and no one [remains], [[H657]] slave [[H6113]] or free. [[H5800]] 
37 He will say: [[H559]] Where [[H335]] are their gods, [[H430]] the rock [[H6697]] in which  they took refuge, [[H2620]] 
38 which [[H834]] ate [[H398]] the fat [[H2459]] of their sacrifices [[H2077]] and drank [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] of their drink offerings? [[H5257]] Let them rise up [[H6965]] and help you; [[H5826]] let them give you [[H1961]] shelter! [[H5643]] 
39 See [[H7200]] now [[H6258]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am He; [[H1931]] there is no [[H369]] God [[H430]] besides Me. [[H5978]] I [[H589]] bring death [[H4191]] and I give life; [[H2421]] I wound [[H4272]] and I [[H589]] heal, [[H7495]] and [there is] no one [[H369]] who can deliver [[H5337]] from My hand. [[H3027]] 
40 For [[H3588]] I lift up [[H5375]] My hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] heaven [[H8064]] and declare: [[H559]] As surely as I [[H595]] live [[H2416]] forever, [[H5769]] 
41 when [[H518]] I sharpen [[H8150]] My flashing [[H1300]] sword, [[H2719]] and My hand [[H3027]] grasps it [[H270]] in judgment, [[H4941]] I will take [[H7725]] vengeance [[H5359]] on My adversaries [[H6862]] and repay [[H7999]] those who hate Me. [[H8130]] 
42 I will make My arrows [[H2671]] drunk [[H7937]] with blood, [[H1818]] while My sword [[H2719]] devours [[H398]] flesh— [[H1320]] the blood [[H1818]] of the slain [[H2491]] and captives, [[H7633]] the heads [[H7218]] of the enemy [[H341]] leaders. [[H6546]]

[[H5650]] He will take [[H7725]] vengeance [[H5359]] on His adversaries [[H6862]] He will cleanse [[H3722]] His land [[H127]] [and] His people.” [[H5971]] 
44 Then Moses [[H4872]] came [[H935]] with Joshua [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] and recited [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the people. [[H5971]] 
45 When Moses [[H4872]] had finished [[H3615]] reciting [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] 
46 he said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Take [[H7760]] to heart [[H3824]] all [[H3605]] these words [[H1697]] I [[H595]] testify [[H5749]] among you  today, [[H3117]] so that [[H834]] you may command [[H6680]] your children [[H1121]] to carefully [[H8104]] follow [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law. [[H8451]] 
47 For [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] are not [[H3808]] idle [[H7386]] words [[H1697]] to you, [[H4480]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] are your life, [[H2416]] and by them [[H2088]] you will live long [[H748]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] you [[H859]] are crossing [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to possess.” [[H3423]] 
48 On that [[H2088]] same [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
49 “Go up [[H5927]] into [[H413]] the Abarim [[H5682]] Range [[H2022]] to Mount [[H2022]] Nebo, [[H5015]] in the land [[H776]] of Moab [[H4124]] across [[H5921]] from [[H6440]] Jericho, [[H3405]] and view [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] am giving [[H5414]] to the Israelites [[H1121]] as their own possession. [[H272]] 
50 And there [[H8033]] on the mountain [[H2022]] that [[H834]] you [[H859]] climb, [[H5927]] you will die [[H4191]] and be gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] your people, [[H5971]] just as [[H834]] your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] died [[H4191]] on Mount [[H2022]] Hor [[H2023]] and was gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] his people. [[H5971]] 
51 For [[H5921]] at the waters [[H4325]] of Meribah-kadesh [[H4808]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin, [[H6790]] both of you broke faith [[H4603]] with Me  among [[H8432]] the Israelites [[H1121]] by [[H5921]] failing [[H3808]] to treat Me as holy [[H6942]] in their [[H1121]] presence. [[H8432]] 
52 Although [[H3588]] you shall see [[H7200]] from a distance [[H5048]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] am giving [[H5414]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] you shall not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] [it].” [[H413]]
