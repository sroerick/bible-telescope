# Deuteronomy 33
[[Deuteronomy 32|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 34|→]]
1 This [[H2063]] is the blessing [[H1293]] that [[H834]] Moses, [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] pronounced [[H1288]] upon the Israelites [[H1121]] before [[H6440]] his death. [[H4194]] 
2 He said: [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] came [[H935]] from Sinai [[H5514]] and dawned [[H2224]] upon us  from Seir; [[H8165]] He shone forth [[H3313]] from Mount [[H2022]] Paran [[H6290]] and came [[H857]] with myriads [[H7233]] of holy ones, [[H6944]] with flaming fire [[H799]] at His right hand. [[H3225]] 
3 Surely [[H637]] You love [[H2245]] the people; [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] the holy ones [are] [[H6918]] in Your hand, [[H3027]] and they [[H1992]] sit down [[H8497]] at Your feet; [[H7272]] each receives [[H5375]] Your words— [[H1703]] 
4 the law [[H8451]] that Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H6680]] us,  the possession [[H4181]] of the congregation [[H6952]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] 
5 So [the LORD] became [[H1961]] King [[H4428]] in Jeshurun [[H3484]] when the leaders [[H7218]] of the people [[H5971]] gathered, [[H622]] together with [[H3162]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
6 Let Reuben [[H7205]] live [[H2421]] and not [[H408]] die, [[H4191]] nor [[H1961]] his men [[H4962]] be few.” [[H4557]] 
7 And [[H2063]] concerning Judah [[H3063]] he said: [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] hear [[H8085]] the cry [[H6963]] of Judah [[H3063]] and bring [[H935]] him to [[H413]] his people. [[H5971]] With his own hands [[H3027]] he defends his cause, [[H7227]] but may You be [[H1961]] a help [[H5828]] against his foes.” [[H6862]] 
8 Concerning Levi [[H3878]] he said: [[H559]] “[Give] Your Thummim [to Levi] [[H8550]] and Your Urim [[H224]] to Your godly [[H2623]] one, [[H376]] whom [[H834]] You tested [[H5254]] at Massah [[H4532]] and contested [[H7378]] at [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Meribah. [[H4809]] 
9 He said [[H559]] of his father [[H1]] and mother, [[H517]] ‘I do not [[H3808]] consider them.’ [[H7200]] He disregarded [[H3808]] his brothers [[H251]] and did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] his own sons, [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] they kept [[H8104]] Your word [[H565]] and maintained [[H5341]] Your covenant. [[H1285]] 
10 They will teach [[H3384]] Your ordinances [[H4941]] to Jacob [[H3290]] and Your law [[H8451]] to Israel; [[H3478]] they will set [[H7760]] incense [[H6988]] before You [[H639]] and whole burnt offerings [[H3632]] on [[H5921]] Your altar. [[H4196]] 
11 Bless [[H1288]] his substance, [[H2428]] O LORD, [[H3069]] and accept [[H7521]] the work [[H6467]] of his hands. [[H3027]] Smash [[H4272]] the loins [[H4975]] of those who rise against him, [[H6965]] and of his foes [[H8130]] so they can [[H4480]] rise [no more].” [[H6965]] 
12 Concerning Benjamin [[H1144]] he said: [[H559]] “May the beloved [[H3039]] of the LORD [[H3068]] rest [[H7931]] secure [[H983]] in Him; [[H5921]] [God] shields [[H2653]] him [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] day long, [[H3117]] and upon His shoulders [[H3802]] he rests.” [[H7931]] 
13 Concerning Joseph [[H3130]] he said: [[H559]] “May his land [[H776]] be blessed [[H1288]] by the LORD [[H3068]] with the dew [[H2919]] of heaven’s [[H8064]] bounty [[H4022]] and the watery depths [[H8415]] that lie [[H7257]] beneath, [[H8478]] 
14 with the bountiful [[H4022]] harvest [[H8393]] from the sun [[H8121]] and the abundant [[H4022]] yield [[H1645]] of the seasons, [[H3391]] 
15 with the best [[H7218]] of the ancient [[H6924]] mountains [[H2042]] and the bounty [[H4022]] of the everlasting [[H5769]] hills, [[H1389]] 
16 with the choice gifts [[H4022]] of the land [[H776]] and everything in it, [[H4393]] and with the favor [[H7522]] of Him who dwelt [[H7931]] in the burning bush. [[H5572]] May these rest [[H935]] on the head [[H7218]] of Joseph [[H3130]] and crown the brow [[H6936]] of the prince [[H5139]] of his brothers. [[H251]] 
17 His  majesty [is like] [[H1926]] a firstborn [[H1060]] bull [[H7794]] and his horns [[H7161]] like those [[H7161]] of a wild ox. [[H7214]] With them he will gore [[H5055]] the nations, [[H5971]] even to the ends [[H657]] of the earth. [[H776]] Such [[H1992]] are the myriads [[H7233]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and such [[H1992]] are the thousands [[H505]] of Manasseh.” [[H4519]] 
18 Concerning Zebulun [[H2074]] he said: [[H559]] “Rejoice, [[H8055]] Zebulun, [[H2074]] in your journeys, [[H3318]] and Issachar, [[H3485]] in your tents. [[H168]] 
19 They will call [[H7121]] the peoples [[H5971]] to a mountain; [[H2022]] there [[H8033]] they will offer [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] of righteousness. [[H6664]] For [[H3588]] they will feast on [[H3243]] the abundance [[H8228]] of the seas [[H3220]] and the hidden [[H8226]] treasures [[H2934]] of the sand.” [[H2344]] 
20 Concerning Gad [[H1410]] he said: [[H559]] “Blessed [is] [[H1288]] he who enlarges [[H7337]] [the domain of] Gad! [[H1410]] He lies down [[H7931]] like a lion [[H3833]] and tears off [[H2963]] an arm [[H2220]] or [[H637]] a head. [[H6936]] 
21 He chose [[H7200]] the best [land] [[H7225]] for himself,  because [[H3588]] a ruler’s [[H2710]] portion [[H2513]] was reserved for him [[H5603]] there. [[H8033]] He came [[H857]] with the leaders [[H7218]] of the people; [[H5971]] he administered [[H6213]] the justice [[H6666]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and His ordinances [[H4941]] for [[H5973]] Israel.” [[H3478]] 
22 Concerning Dan [[H1835]] he said: [[H559]] “Dan [is] [[H1835]] a lion’s [[H738]] cub, [[H1482]] leaping [[H2187]] out of [[H4480]] Bashan.” [[H1316]] 
23 Concerning Naphtali [[H5321]] he said: [[H559]] “Naphtali [[H5321]] is abounding [[H7649]] with favor, [[H7522]] full [[H4392]] of the blessing [[H1293]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] he shall take possession [[H3423]] of the Sea [[H3220]] and the south.” [[H1864]] 
24 Concerning Asher [[H836]] he said: [[H559]] “May Asher [[H836]] be the most blessed [[H1288]] of sons; [[H1121]] may he be [[H1961]] the most favored [[H7521]] among his brothers [[H251]] and dip [[H2881]] his foot [[H7272]] in oil. [[H8081]] 
25 May the bolts of your gate [[H4515]] be iron [[H1270]] and bronze, [[H5178]] and your strength [[H1679]] match your days. [[H3117]] 
26 There is none [[H369]] like the God [[H410]] of Jeshurun, [[H3484]] who rides [[H7392]] the heavens [[H8064]] to your aid, [[H5828]] and the clouds [[H7834]] in His majesty. [[H1346]] 
27 The eternal [[H6924]] God [[H430]] is your dwelling place, [[H4585]] and underneath [[H8478]] are the everlasting [[H5769]] arms. [[H2220]] He drives out [[H1644]] the enemy [[H341]] before you, [[H6440]] giving the command, [[H559]] ‘Destroy [him]!’ [[H8045]] 
28 So Israel [[H3478]] dwells [[H7931]] securely; [[H983]] the fountain [[H5869]] of Jacob [[H3290]] lives untroubled [[H910]] in [[H413]] a land [[H776]] of grain [[H1715]] and new wine, [[H8492]] where even [[H637]] the heavens [[H8064]] drip [[H6201]] with dew. [[H2919]] 
29 Blessed [are] you, [[H835]] O Israel! [[H3478]] Who [[H4310]] is like you, [[H3644]] a people [[H5971]] saved [[H3467]] by the LORD? [[H3068]] He is the shield [[H4043]] that protects you, [[H5828]] the sword [[H2719]] in which you boast. [[H1346]] Your enemies [[H341]] will cower before you, [[H3584]] and you [[H859]] shall trample [[H1869]] their high places.” [[H1116]]
