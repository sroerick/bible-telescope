# Deuteronomy 19
[[Deuteronomy 18|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 20|→]]
1 When [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has cut off [[H3772]] the nations [[H1471]] whose land [[H776]] He [[H3068]] is giving you, [[H5414]] so that you drive them out [[H3423]] and settle [[H3427]] in their cities [[H5892]] and houses, [[H1004]] 
2 then you are to set apart [[H914]] for yourselves  three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] within [[H8432]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you to possess. [[H3423]] 
3 You are to build [[H3559]] roads [[H1870]] for yourselves  and divide into three regions [[H8027]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you as an inheritance, [[H5157]] so that any [[H3605]] manslayer [[H7523]] can flee [[H5127]] to these cities. [[H8033]] 
4 Now this [[H2088]] is the situation [[H1697]] regarding the manslayer [[H7523]] who [[H834]] flees [[H5127]] [to one of these cities] [[H8033]] to save his life, [[H2425]] having killed [[H5221]] his neighbor [[H7453]] accidentally, [[H1097]] without [[H3808]] intending to harm him: [[H8130]] 
5 If [[H834]] he goes [[H935]] into the forest [[H3293]] with [[H854]] his neighbor [[H7453]] to cut [[H2404]] timber [[H6086]] and swings [[H5080]] his ax [[H1631]] to chop down [[H3772]] a tree, [[H6086]] but the blade flies off [[H5394]] the handle [[H6086]] and strikes [[H4672]] and kills [[H4191]] his neighbor, [[H7453]] he [[H1931]] may flee [[H5127]] to [[H413]] one [[H259]] of these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] to save his life. [[H2425]] 
6 Otherwise, [[H6435]] the avenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] might pursue [[H7291]] the manslayer [[H7523]] in a rage, [[H3824]] overtake him [[H5381]] since the distance [[H1870]] is great, [[H7235]] and strike [[H5221]] him dead [[H5315]] though he did not [[H369]] deserve [[H4941]] to die, [[H4194]] since [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] did not [[H3808]] intend any harm. [[H8130]] 
7 This is why [[H5921]] I [[H595]] am commanding [[H6680]] you to set apart [[H914]] three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] for yourselves.  
8 And if [[H518]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] enlarges [[H7337]] your territory, [[H1366]] as [[H834]] He swore [[H7650]] to your fathers, [[H1]] and gives [[H5414]] you  all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] He promised [[H1696]] them, [[H1]] 
9 and if [[H3588]] you carefully observe [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2063]] commandments [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving you [[H6680]] today, [[H3117]] loving [[H157]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] and walking [[H1980]] in His ways [[H1870]] at all times, [[H3605]] then you are to add [[H3254]] three [[H7969]] more [[H5750]] cities [[H5892]] to [[H5921]] these [[H428]] three. [[H7969]] 
10 Thus innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] will not [[H3808]] be shed [[H8210]] in [[H7130]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you as an inheritance, [[H5159]] so that you will not be [[H1961]] guilty of bloodshed. [[H1818]] 
11 If, however, [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] hates [[H8130]] his neighbor [[H7453]] and lies in wait, [[H693]] attacks [[H6965]] him [[H5921]] and kills him, [[H5221]] and then flees [[H5127]] to [[H413]] one [[H259]] of these [[H411]] cities, [[H5892]] 
12 the elders [[H2205]] of his city [[H5892]] must send for him, [[H7971]] bring [[H3947]] him [[H853]] back, [[H8033]] and hand him over to [[H5414]] the avenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] to die. [[H4191]] 
13 You must show him no pity. [[H2347]] You are to purge [[H1197]] from Israel [[H3478]] the guilt of shedding innocent [[H5355]] blood, [[H1818]] that it may go well with you. [[H2896]] 
14 You must not [[H3808]] move [[H5253]] your neighbor’s [[H7453]] boundary marker, [[H1366]] which was set up [[H1379]] by your ancestors [[H7223]] [to mark] the inheritance [[H5159]] you shall receive [[H5157]] in the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you to possess. [[H3423]] 
15 A lone [[H259]] witness [[H5707]] is not sufficient [[H3808]] to establish [[H6965]] any [[H3605]] wrongdoing [[H5771]] [or] [[H3605]] sin [[H2403]] against a man, [[H376]] regardless of what [[H3605]] offense [[H2399]] he may have committed. [[H2398]] A matter [[H1697]] must be established [[H6965]] by [[H5921]] the testimony [[H6310]] of two [[H8147]] or [[H176]] three [[H7969]] witnesses. [[H5707]] 
16 If [[H3588]] a false [[H2555]] witness [[H5707]] testifies [[H6030]] against someone, [[H376]] accusing him of a crime, [[H5627]] 
17 both [[H8147]] parties [[H376]] to the dispute [[H7379]] must stand [[H5975]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] the priests [[H3548]] and judges [[H8199]] who [[H834]] are [[H1961]] [in office] [[H1992]] at that [[H1992]] time. [[H3117]] 
18 The judges [[H8199]] shall investigate [[H1875]] thoroughly, [[H3190]] and if [[H2009]] the witness [[H5707]] is proven to be a liar [[H8267]] who has falsely [[H8267]] accused [[H6030]] his brother, [[H251]] 
19 you must do [[H6213]] to him as [[H834]] he intended [[H2161]] to do [[H6213]] to his brother. [[H251]] You must purge [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] from among you. [[H7130]] 
20 Then the rest [of the people] [[H7604]] will hear [[H8085]] and be afraid, [[H3372]] and they will never [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] do [[H6213]] anything [[H1697]] so [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] among you. [[H7130]] 
21 You must show no pity: [[H3808]] life [[H5315]] for life, [[H5315]] eye [[H5869]] for eye, [[H5869]] tooth [[H8127]] for tooth, [[H8127]] hand [[H3027]] for hand, [[H3027]] [and] foot [[H7272]] for foot. [[H7272]]
