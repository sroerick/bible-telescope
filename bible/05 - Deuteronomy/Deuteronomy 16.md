[[Deuteronomy 15|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 17|→]]
1 Observe [[H8104]] the month [[H2320]] of Abib [[H24]] and celebrate [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] because [[H3588]] in the month [[H2320]] of Abib [[H24]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] brought you out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] by night. [[H3915]] 
2 You are to offer [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] the Passover sacrifice [[H6453]] from the herd [[H1241]] or flock [[H6629]] in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] will choose [[H977]] as a dwelling [[H7931]] for His Name. [[H8034]] 
3 You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] leavened bread [[H2557]] with it; [[H5921]] for seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] you are to eat [[H398]] with it [[H5921]] unleavened bread, [[H4682]] the bread [[H3899]] of affliction, [[H6040]] because [[H3588]] you left [[H3318]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] in haste— [[H2649]] so that [[H4616]] you may remember [[H2142]] for the rest [[H3605]] of your life [[H2416]] the day [[H3117]] you left [[H3318]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
4 No [[H3808]] yeast [[H7603]] is to be found [[H7200]] in all [[H3605]] your land [[H1366]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and none [[H3808]] of [[H4480]] the meat [[H1320]] you sacrifice [[H2076]] in the evening [[H6153]] of the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] shall remain [[H3885]] until morning. [[H1242]] 
5 You are not [[H3808]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] the Passover animal [[H6453]] in any [[H259]] of the towns [[H8179]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you. [[H5414]] 
6 You must only [[H3588]] offer [[H2076]] the Passover sacrifice [[H6453]] at [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will choose [[H977]] as a dwelling [[H7931]] for His Name. [[H8034]] Do this in the evening [[H6153]] as the sun [[H8121]] sets, [[H935]] at the same time [[H4150]] you departed [[H3318]] from Egypt. [[H4714]] 
7 And you shall roast [[H1310]] and eat it [[H398]] in the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will choose, [[H977]] and in the morning [[H1242]] you shall return [[H1980]] to your tents. [[H168]] 
8 For six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] you must eat [[H398]] unleavened bread, [[H4682]] and on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] you shall hold a solemn assembly [[H6116]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and you must not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] any work. [[H4399]] 
9 You are to count off [[H5608]] seven [[H7651]] weeks [[H7620]] [from] [[H5608]] [the time] [[H7620]] you first put the sickle [[H2770]] to the standing grain. [[H7054]] 
10 And you shall celebrate [[H6213]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Weeks [[H7620]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] with a freewill offering [[H5071]] that [[H834]] you give [[H5414]] in proportion to how [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has blessed you, [[H1288]] 
11 and you shall rejoice [[H8055]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] He [[H3068]] will choose [[H977]] as a dwelling [[H7931]] for His Name— [[H8034]] you, [[H859]] your sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] your menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H519]] and the Levite [[H3881]] within your gates, [[H8179]] as well as the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widows [[H490]] among you. [[H7130]] 
12 Remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] you were [[H1961]] slaves [[H5650]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and carefully [[H8104]] follow [[H6213]] these [[H428]] statutes. [[H2706]] 
13 You are to celebrate [[H6213]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Tabernacles [[H5521]] for seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] after you have gathered [[H622]] [the produce of] your threshing floor [[H1637]] and your winepress. [[H3342]] 
14 And you shall rejoice [[H8055]] in your feast— [[H2282]] you, [[H859]] your sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] your menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H519]] and the Levite, [[H3881]] as well as the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widows [[H490]] among you. [[H8179]] 
15 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] you shall celebrate a feast [[H2287]] for the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in the place [[H4725]] He [[H3068]] will choose, [[H977]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will bless [[H1288]] you in all [[H3605]] your produce [[H8393]] and in all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of your hands, [[H3027]] so that your joy [[H8056]] will be [[H1961]] complete. [[H389]] 
16 Three [[H7969]] times [[H6471]] a year [[H8141]] all [[H3605]] your men [[H2138]] are to appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in the place [[H4725]] He will choose: [[H977]] at the Feast [[H2282]] of Unleavened Bread, [[H4682]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Weeks, [[H7620]] and the Feast [[H2282]] of Tabernacles [[H5521]] No one [[H3808]] should appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] empty-handed. [[H7387]] 
17 Everyone [[H376]] must appear with a gift [[H4979]] as he is able, [[H3027]] according to the blessing [[H1293]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has given you. [[H5414]] 
18 You are to appoint [[H5414]] judges [[H8199]] and officials [[H7860]] for your tribes [[H7626]] in every [[H3605]] town [[H8179]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you. [[H5414]] They are to judge [[H8199]] the people [[H5971]] with righteous [[H6664]] judgment. [[H4941]] 
19 Do not [[H3808]] deny [[H5186]] justice [[H4941]] or show partiality. [[H5234]] Do not [[H3808]] accept [[H3947]] any bribes, [[H7810]] for [[H3588]] a bribe [[H7810]] blinds [[H5786]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the wise [[H2450]] and twists [[H5557]] the words [[H1697]] of the righteous. [[H6662]] 
20 Pursue [[H7291]] justice, [[H6664]] and justice alone, [[H6664]] so that [[H4616]] you may live, [[H2421]] and you may possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you. [[H5414]] 
21 You shall not [[H3808]] plant [[H5193]] any [[H3605]] kind of tree [[H6086]] as an Asherah pole [[H842]] next to [[H681]] the altar [[H4196]] you will build [[H6213]] for the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] 
22 and do not [[H3808]] set up [[H6965]] for yourselves  a sacred pillar, [[H4676]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hates. [[H8130]]
