# Deuteronomy 10
[[Deuteronomy 9|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 11|→]]
1 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Chisel [[H6458]] two [[H8147]] stone [[H68]] tablets [[H3871]] like the first ones, [[H7223]] come up [[H5927]] to Me [[H413]] on the mountain, [[H2022]] and make [[H6213]] an ark [[H727]] of wood. [[H6086]] 
2 And I will write [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] the tablets [[H3871]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the first [[H7223]] tablets, [[H3871]] which [[H834]] you broke; [[H7665]] and you are to place [[H7760]] them in the ark.” [[H727]] 
3 So I made [[H6213]] an ark [[H727]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood, [[H6086]] cut [[H6458]] two [[H8147]] stone [[H68]] tablets [[H3871]] like the first ones, [[H7223]] and climbed [[H5927]] the mountain [[H2022]] with the two [[H8147]] tablets [[H3871]] in my hands. [[H3027]] 
4 And [the LORD] wrote [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] the tablets [[H3871]] what had been written [[H4385]] previously, [[H7223]] the Ten [[H6235]] Commandments [[H1697]] that [[H834]] He [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] you on the mountain [[H2022]] out of [[H8432]] the fire [[H784]] on the day [[H3117]] of the assembly. [[H6951]] The LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] them to me, [[H413]] 
5 and I went back [[H6437]] down [[H3381]] the mountain [[H2022]] and placed [[H7760]] the tablets [[H3871]] in the ark [[H727]] I had made, [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded me, [[H6680]] and there [[H8033]] they have remained. [[H1961]] 
6 The Israelites [[H1121]] traveled [[H5265]] from  Beeroth Bene-jaakan [[H885]] to Moserah, [[H4149]] where [[H8033]] Aaron [[H175]] died [[H4191]] and was buried, [[H6912]] and Eleazar [[H499]] his son [[H1121]] succeeded him as priest. [[H3547]] 
7 From [[H4480]] there [[H8033]] they traveled [[H5265]] to Gudgodah, [[H1412]] and from Gudgodah [[H1412]] to Jotbathah, [[H3193]] a land [[H776]] with streams [[H5158]] of water. [[H4325]] 
8 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the LORD [[H3068]] set apart [[H914]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Levi [[H3878]] to carry [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] to serve Him, [[H8334]] and to pronounce blessings [[H1288]] in His name, [[H8034]] as [they do] to this day. [[H5704]] 
9 That is why [[H5921]] Levi [[H3881]] has [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] portion [[H2506]] or inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H5973]] his brothers; [[H251]] the LORD [[H3068]] is his inheritance, [[H5159]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] promised him. [[H1696]] 
10 I [[H595]] stayed [[H5975]] on the mountain [[H2022]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights, [[H3915]] like the first [[H7223]] time, [[H3117]] and that [[H1931]] time [[H6471]] the LORD [[H3068]] again [[H1571]] listened [[H8085]] to me [[H413]] [and] [[H3068]] agreed [[H14]] not [[H3808]] to destroy you. [[H7843]] 
11 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Get up. [[H6965]] Continue [[H1980]] your journey [[H4550]] ahead of [[H6440]] the people, [[H5971]] that they may enter [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] I swore [[H7650]] to  their fathers [[H1]] to give them.” [[H5414]] 
12 “And now, [[H6258]] O Israel, [[H3478]] what [[H4100]] does the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] ask [[H7592]] of you [[H5973]] but [[H3588]] to fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] by walking [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] His ways, [[H1870]] to love Him, [[H157]] to serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] your soul, [[H5315]] 
13 [and] to keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2708]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] am giving you [[H6680]] this day [[H3117]] for your own good? [[H2896]] 
14 Behold, [[H2005]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] belong the heavens, [[H8064]] even the highest [[H8064]] heavens, [[H8064]] and the earth [[H776]] and everything in it. [[H3605]] 
15 Yet [[H7535]] the LORD [[H3068]] has set His affection [[H2836]] on your fathers [[H1]] and loved [[H157]] them. [[H853]] And He has chosen you, [[H977]] their descendants [[H2233]] after [[H310]] them,  above all [[H3605]] the peoples, [[H5971]] even to this day. [[H3117]] 
16 Circumcise [[H4135]] your hearts, therefore, [[H3824]] and stiffen [[H7185]] your necks [[H6203]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]] 
17 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is God [[H430]] of gods [[H430]] and Lord [[H136]] of lords, [[H113]] the great, [[H1419]] mighty, [[H1368]] and awesome [[H3372]] God, [[H410]] showing no [[H3808]] partiality [[H5375]] and accepting [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] bribe. [[H7810]] 
18 He executes [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] for the fatherless [[H3490]] and widow, [[H490]] and He loves [[H157]] the foreigner, [[H1616]] giving [[H5414]] him  food [[H3899]] and clothing. [[H8071]] 
19 So you also must love [[H157]] the foreigner, [[H1616]] since [[H3588]] you yourselves were [[H1961]] foreigners [[H1616]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
20 You are to fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and serve Him. [[H5647]] Hold fast to Him [[H1692]] and take your oaths [[H7650]] in His name. [[H8034]] 
21 He [[H1931]] is your praise [[H8416]] and He [[H1931]] is your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] has done [[H6213]] for you [[H853]] these [[H428]] great [[H1419]] and awesome wonders [[H3372]] your eyes [[H5869]] have seen. [[H7200]] 
22 Your fathers [[H1]] went down [[H3381]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] seventy [[H7657]] in all, [[H5315]] and now [[H6258]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has made [[H7760]] you as numerous [[H7230]] as the stars [[H3556]] in the sky. [[H8064]]
