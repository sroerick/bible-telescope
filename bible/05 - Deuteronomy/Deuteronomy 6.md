# Deuteronomy 6
[[Deuteronomy 5|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 7|→]]
1 These are [[H2063]] the commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has instructed [[H6680]] me to teach you [[H3925]] to follow [[H6213]] in the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are about to enter [[H5674]] and possess, [[H3423]] 
2 so that you [[H4616]] and your children [[H1121]] and grandchildren [[H1121]] may fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of your lives [[H2416]] by keeping [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] His statutes [[H2708]] and commandments [[H4687]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] give [[H6680]] you, [[H859]] and so that [[H4616]] your days [[H3117]] may be prolonged. [[H748]] 
3 Hear, [[H8085]] O Israel, [[H3478]] and be careful [[H8104]] to observe them, [[H6213]] so that [[H834]] you may prosper [[H3190]] and multiply [[H7235]] greatly [[H3966]] in a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] just as [[H834]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] has promised [[H1696]] you.  
4 Hear, [[H8085]] O Israel: [[H3478]] The LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] the LORD [[H3068]] is One. [[H259]] 
5 And you shall love [[H157]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] your soul [[H5315]] and with all [[H3605]] your strength. [[H3966]] 
6 These [[H428]] words [[H1697]] I [[H595]] am commanding you [[H6680]] today [[H3117]] are to be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] your hearts. [[H3824]] 
7 And you shall teach them diligently [[H8150]] to your children [[H1121]] and speak of them [[H1696]] when you sit [[H3427]] in your house [[H1004]] and when you walk [[H1980]] along the road, [[H1870]] when you lie down [[H7901]] and when you get up. [[H6965]] 
8 Tie them [[H7194]] as reminders [[H226]] on [[H5921]] your hands [[H3027]] and bind them [[H1961]] on your foreheads. [[H996]] 
9 Write [[H3789]] them on [[H5921]] the doorposts [[H4201]] of your houses [[H1004]] and on your gates. [[H8179]] 
10 And when [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] brings [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] He swore [[H7650]] to your fathers, [[H1]] to Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob, [[H3290]] that He would give [[H5414]] you—  [a land with] great [[H1419]] and splendid [[H2896]] cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] you did not [[H3808]] build, [[H1129]] 
11 with houses [[H1004]] full of [[H4392]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2898]] thing with which [[H834]] you did not [[H3808]] fill them, [[H4390]] with wells [[H953]] that [[H834]] you did not [[H3808]] dig, [[H2672]] and with vineyards [[H3754]] and olive groves [[H2132]] that [[H834]] you did not [[H3808]] plant— [[H5193]] and when you eat [[H398]] and are satisfied, [[H7646]] 
12 be careful [[H8104]] not [[H6435]] to forget [[H7911]] the LORD [[H3068]] who [[H834]] brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery. [[H5650]] 
13 Fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] serve Him, [[H5647]] and take your oaths [[H7650]] using only His name. [[H8034]] 
14 Do not [[H3808]] follow [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] the gods [[H430]] of the peoples [[H5971]] around you. [[H5439]] 
15 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who is among you, [[H7130]] is a jealous [[H7067]] God. [[H410]] Otherwise, [[H6435]] the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will be kindled against you, [[H2734]] and He will wipe you [[H8045]] off [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]] 
16 Do not [[H3808]] test [[H5254]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] as [[H834]] you tested Him [[H5254]] at Massah. [[H4532]] 
17 You are to diligently [[H8104]] keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and the testimonies [[H5713]] and statutes [[H2706]] He has commanded you. [[H6680]] 
18 Do [[H6213]] what is right [[H3477]] and good [[H2896]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] so that [[H4616]] it may be well [[H3190]] with you  and that you may enter [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] which the LORD [[H3068]] your God swore [[H7650]] to give your fathers, [[H1]] 
19 driving out [[H1920]] all [[H3605]] your enemies [[H341]] before you, [[H6440]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has said. [[H1696]] 
20 In the future, [[H4279]] when [[H3588]] your son [[H1121]] asks you, [[H7592]] “What [[H4100]] is the meaning of the decrees [[H5713]] and statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] has commanded you?” [[H6680]] 
21 then you are to tell [[H559]] him, [[H1121]] “We were [[H1961]] slaves [[H5650]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] but the LORD [[H3068]] brought us out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand. [[H3027]] 
22 Before our eyes [[H5869]] the LORD [[H3068]] inflicted [[H5414]] great [[H1419]] and devastating [[H7451]] signs [[H226]] and wonders [[H4159]] on Egypt, [[H4714]] on Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and on all [[H3605]] his household, [[H1004]] 
23 but He brought us [[H3318]] from there [[H8033]] to [[H4616]] lead us in [[H935]] and give [[H5414]] us the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] He had sworn [[H7650]] to our fathers. [[H1]] 
24 And the LORD [[H3068]] commanded us [[H6680]] to observe [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] statutes [[H2706]] and to fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] that we might always prosper [[H2896]] and be preserved, [[H2421]] [as we are] this day. [[H3117]] 
25 And if we are careful [[H8104]] to observe [[H6213]] every [[H3605]] one of these [[H2063]] commandments [[H4687]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] just as [[H834]] He has commanded us, [[H6680]] then that [[H3588]] will be [[H1961]] our  righteousness.” [[H6666]]
