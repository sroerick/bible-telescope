# Deuteronomy 13
[[Deuteronomy 12|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 14|→]]
1 If [[H3588]] a prophet [[H5030]] or [[H176]] dreamer [[H2492]] of dreams [[H2472]] arises [[H6965]] among you [[H7130]] and proclaims [[H5414]] a sign [[H226]] or [[H176]] wonder [[H4159]] to you, [[H413]] 
2 and if the sign [[H226]] or wonder [[H4159]] he has spoken [[H1696]] to you [[H413]] comes about, [[H935]] but he says, [[H559]] “Let us follow [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] (which you have not [[H3808]] known) [[H3045]] and let us worship them,” [[H5647]] 
3 you must not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of that [[H1931]] prophet [[H5030]] or [[H176]] dreamer. [[H2492]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is testing you [[H5254]] to find out [[H3045]] whether [[H3426]] you love [[H157]] [Him] [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] your soul. [[H5315]] 
4 You are to follow [[H1980]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] and [[H853]] fear Him. [[H3372]] Keep [[H8104]] His commandments [[H4687]] and listen [[H8085]] to His voice; [[H6963]] serve [[H5647]] Him  and hold Him fast. [[H1692]] 
5 Such a [[H1931]] prophet [[H5030]] or [[H176]] dreamer [[H2492]] must be put to death, [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] he has advocated [[H1696]] rebellion [[H5627]] against [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who brought you out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and redeemed you [[H6299]] from the house [[H1004]] of slavery, [[H5650]] in order to turn you [[H5080]] from the way [[H1870]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has commanded you [[H6680]] to walk. [[H1980]] So you must purge [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] from among you. [[H7130]] 
6 If [[H3588]] your very own brother, [[H251]] or [[H176]] your son [[H1121]] or [[H176]] daughter, [[H1323]] or [[H176]] the wife [[H802]] you embrace, [[H2436]] or [[H176]] your closest friend [[H7453]] secretly [[H5643]] entices you, [[H5496]] saying, [[H559]] “Let us go [[H1980]] and worship [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods” [[H430]] (which [[H834]] neither you [[H859]] nor [[H3808]] your fathers [[H1]] have known, [[H3045]] 
7 the gods [[H430]] of the peoples [[H5971]] around you, [[H5439]] whether near [[H7138]] or [[H176]] far, [[H7350]] from [[H4480]] one end [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] to the other [[H5704]] ), [[H776]] 
8 you must not [[H3808]] yield [[H14]] to him  or listen [[H8085]] to him. [[H413]] Show him no [[H3808]] pity, [[H2347]] and do not [[H3808]] spare [[H2550]] him [[H3808]] or shield [[H3680]] him. [[H5921]] 
9 Instead, [[H3588]] you must surely kill him. [[H2026]] Your hand [[H3027]] must be [[H1961]] the first [[H7223]] against him  to put him to death, [[H4191]] and then [[H314]] the hands [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]] 
10 Stone him [[H5619]] to death [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] trying [[H1245]] to turn you [[H5080]] away from [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery. [[H5650]] 
11 Then all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] will hear [[H8085]] and be afraid, [[H3372]] and will never [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] do [[H6213]] such [[H1697]] a wicked [[H7451]] thing [[H2088]] among you. [[H7130]] 
12 If, [[H3588]] regarding one [[H259]] of the cities [[H5892]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you  to inhabit, [[H3427]] you hear [[H8085]] it said [[H559]] 
13 that wicked [[H1100]] men [[H376]] have arisen [[H3318]] from among you [[H7130]] and led the people [[H3427]] of their city [[H5892]] astray, [[H5080]] saying, [[H559]] “Let us go [[H1980]] and serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods” [[H430]] (which [[H834]] you have not [[H3808]] known), [[H3045]] 
14 then you must inquire, [[H1875]] investigate, [[H2713]] and interrogate [[H7592]] thoroughly. [[H3190]] And if [[H2009]] it is established with certainty [[H571]] that this [[H2063]] abomination [[H8441]] has been committed [[H6213]] among you, [[H7130]] 
15 you must surely strike down [[H5221]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of that [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] with the sword. [[H2719]] Destroy [[H2763]] with [[H6310]] the sword [[H2719]] all [its people] [[H3605]] and livestock. [[H929]] 
16 And [[H853]] you are to gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] its plunder [[H7998]] in [[H413]] the middle [[H8432]] of the public square, [[H7339]] and completely burn [[H8313]] the city [[H5892]] and all [[H3605]] its plunder [[H7998]] as a whole burnt offering [[H3632]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] [The city] must remain [[H1961]] a mound of ruins [[H8510]] forever, [[H5769]] never [[H3808]] to be rebuilt. [[H1129]] 
17 Nothing [[H3808]] set apart for destruction [[H2764]] shall be found [[H1692]] in your hands, [[H3027]] so that [[H4616]] the LORD [[H3068]] will turn [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] His fierce anger, [[H2740]] grant [[H5414]] you mercy, [[H7356]] show you compassion, [[H7355]] and multiply you [[H7235]] as [[H834]] He swore [[H7650]] to your fathers, [[H1]] 
18 because [[H3588]] you obey [[H8085]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] keeping [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] His commandments [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving you today, [[H6680]] doing [[H6213]] what is right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]
