# Deuteronomy 31
[[Deuteronomy 30|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 32|→]]
1 Then Moses [[H4872]] went out [[H1980]] and spoke [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]] 
2 “I [[H595]] am now [[H3117]] a hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] years old; [[H1121]] I am [[H3201]] no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] able to come [[H3318]] and go, [[H935]] and the LORD [[H3068]] has said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘You shall not [[H3808]] cross [[H5674]] the [[H2088]] Jordan.’ [[H3383]] 
3 The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] Himself [[H1931]] will cross over [[H5674]] ahead of you. [[H6440]] He [[H1931]] will destroy [[H8045]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] before you, [[H6440]] and you will dispossess them. [[H3423]] Joshua [[H3091]] will cross [[H5674]] ahead of you, [[H6440]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has said. [[H1696]] 
4 And the LORD [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] to them  as [[H834]] He did [[H6213]] to Sihon [[H5511]] and Og, [[H5747]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] when [[H834]] He destroyed [[H8045]] them [[H853]] along with their land. [[H776]] 
5 The LORD [[H3068]] will deliver them over [[H5414]] to you, [[H6440]] and you must do [[H6213]] to them  exactly as [[H3605]] I have commanded [[H6680]] you. [[H853]] 
6 Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous; [[H553]] do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or terrified [[H6206]] of them, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] it is the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] who [[H1931]] goes [[H1980]] with you; [[H5973]] He will never [[H3808]] leave you [[H7503]] [nor] [[H3808]] forsake you.” [[H5800]] 
7 Then Moses [[H4872]] called [[H7121]] for Joshua [[H3091]] and said [[H559]] to him [[H413]] in the presence [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] “Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous, [[H553]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] will go [[H935]] with [[H854]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] swore [[H7650]] to their fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] them,  and you [[H859]] shall give it to them as an inheritance. [[H5157]] 
8 The LORD [[H3068]] Himself [[H1931]] goes [[H1980]] before you; [[H6440]] He [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] with you. [[H5973]] He will never [[H3808]] leave you [[H7503]] or forsake you. [[H5800]] Do not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] or discouraged.” [[H2865]] 
9 So Moses [[H4872]] wrote down [[H3789]] this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] and gave [[H5414]] it to [[H413]] the priests, [[H3548]] the sons [[H1121]] of Levi, [[H3878]] who carried [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
10 Then Moses [[H4872]] commanded them, [[H6680]] “At the end [[H7093]] of [every] seven [[H7651]] years, [[H8141]] at the appointed time [[H4150]] in the year [[H8141]] of remission [of debt], [[H8059]] during the Feast [[H2282]] of Tabernacles, [[H5521]] 
11 when all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] comes [[H935]] before [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] at the place [[H4725]] He will choose, [[H977]] you are to read [[H7121]] this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] in the hearing [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
12 Assemble [[H6950]] the people— [[H5971]] men, [[H376]] women, [[H802]] children, [[H2945]] and the foreigners [[H1616]] within your gates— [[H8179]] so that [[H4616]] they may listen [[H8085]] and learn [[H3925]] to fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and follow [[H6213]] carefully [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law. [[H8451]] 
13 Then their children [[H1121]] who [[H834]] do not [[H3808]] know [the law] [[H3045]] will listen [[H8085]] and learn [[H3925]] to fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] as [[H3605]] long as you [[H859]] live [[H2416]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] you [[H859]] are crossing [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to possess.” [[H3423]] 
14 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Behold, [[H2005]] the time [[H3117]] of your death [[H4191]] is near. [[H7126]] Call [[H7121]] Joshua [[H3091]] and present yourselves [[H3320]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] so that I may commission him.” [[H6680]] So Moses [[H4872]] and Joshua [[H3091]] went [[H1980]] and presented themselves [[H3320]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
15 Then the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] at the tent [[H168]] in a pillar [[H5982]] of cloud, [[H6051]] and the cloud [[H6051]] stood [[H5975]] over [[H5921]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the tent. [[H168]] 
16 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “You will soon [[H2009]] rest [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] your fathers, [[H1]] and these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] will rise up [[H6965]] and prostitute themselves [[H2181]] with [[H310]] the foreign [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] of the land [[H776]] they [[H1931]] are entering. [[H935]] They will forsake [[H5800]] Me and break [[H6565]] the covenant [[H1285]] I have made [[H3772]] with them. [[H854]] 
17 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] My anger [[H639]] will burn [[H2734]] against them,  and I will abandon them [[H5800]] and hide [[H5641]] My face [[H6440]] from them, [[H1992]] so that they will be [[H1961]] consumed, [[H398]] and many [[H7227]] troubles [[H7451]] and afflictions [[H6869]] will befall them. [[H4672]] On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they will say, [[H559]] ‘Have not [[H3808]] these [[H428]] disasters [[H7451]] come upon us [[H4672]] because [[H5921]] our God [[H430]] is no [[H369]] longer with us? [[H7130]] 
18 And [[H595]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will surely [[H5640]] hide [[H5641]] My face [[H6440]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] they have done [[H6213]] by turning [[H6437]] to [[H413]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]] 
19 Now therefore, [[H6258]] write down [[H3789]] for yourselves  this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] and teach [[H3925]] it to the Israelites; [[H1121]] have them recite [[H7760]] it, [[H6310]] so that [[H4616]] [it] [[H2063]] may be [[H1961]] a witness [[H5707]] for Me  against [them]. [[H1121]] 
20 When [[H3588]] I have brought them [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H127]] I swore [[H7650]] to give their fathers, [[H1]] a land flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] they will eat [[H398]] their fill [[H7646]] and prosper. [[H1878]] Then they will turn [[H6437]] to [[H413]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] and worship them, [[H5647]] and they will reject Me [[H5006]] and break [[H6565]] My covenant. [[H1285]] 
21 And when [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] troubles [[H7451]] and afflictions [[H6869]] have come upon them, [[H4672]] this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] will testify [[H6030]] against them, [[H6440]] because [[H3588]] it will not be forgotten [[H7911]] from the lips [[H6310]] of their descendants. [[H2233]] For [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] their inclination, [[H3336]] even before [[H2962]] I bring [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] I swore to give them. [[H7650]] 
22 So that very [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Moses [[H4872]] wrote down [[H3789]] this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] and taught it [[H3925]] to the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
23 Then the LORD commissioned [[H6680]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] and said, [[H559]] “Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous, [[H553]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] will bring [[H935]] the Israelites [[H1121]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] I swore to give [[H7650]] them,  and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] with you.” [[H5973]] 
24 When Moses [[H4872]] had finished [[H3615]] writing [[H3789]] in a book [[H5612]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] from beginning to end, [[H8552]] 
25 he gave this command to [[H6680]] the Levites [[H3881]] who carried [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] 
26 “Take [[H3947]] this [[H2088]] Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] and place [[H7760]] it [[H853]] beside [[H6654]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] so that it may remain [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] as a witness [[H5707]] against you.  
27 For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] know [[H3045]] how rebellious [[H4805]] and stiff-necked you are. [[H6203]] If you are already [[H1961]] rebelling [[H4784]] against [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] while I am still [[H5750]] alive, [[H2416]] how much more [[H637]] will you rebel after [[H310]] my death! [[H4194]] 
28 Assemble [[H6950]] before me [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of your tribes [[H7626]] and [all] your officers [[H7860]] so that I may speak [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in their hearing [[H241]] and call heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] to witness [[H5749]] against them.  
29 For [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] after [[H310]] my death [[H4194]] you will become utterly corrupt [[H7843]] and turn [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] the path [[H1870]] I have commanded you. [[H6680]] And in [[H319]] the days {to come}, [[H3117]] disaster [[H7451]] will befall [[H7122]] you [[H853]] because [[H3588]] you will do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to provoke Him to anger [[H3707]] by the work [[H4639]] of your hands. [[H3027]] 
30 Then Moses [[H4872]] recited aloud [[H1696]] to the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] [from beginning] [[H5704]] to end: [[H8552]]
