# Deuteronomy 9
[[Deuteronomy 8|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 10|→]]
1 Hear, [[H8085]] O Israel. [[H3478]] Today [[H3117]] you [[H859]] are about to cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to go in [[H935]] and dispossess [[H3423]] nations [[H1471]] greater [[H1419]] and stronger [[H6099]] than you, [[H4480]] with large [[H1419]] cities [[H5892]] fortified [[H1219]] to the heavens. [[H8064]] 
2 The people [[H5971]] are strong [[H1419]] and tall, [[H7311]] the descendants [[H1121]] of the Anakim. [[H6062]] You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] about them [[H834]] and you [[H859]] have heard it said, [[H8085]] “Who [[H4310]] can stand up [[H3320]] to [[H6440]] the sons [[H1121]] of Anak?” [[H6061]] 
3 But understand [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] goes across [[H5674]] ahead of you [[H6440]] as a consuming [[H398]] fire; [[H784]] He [[H1931]] will destroy them [[H8045]] and subdue them [[H3665]] before you. [[H6440]] And you will drive them out [[H3423]] and annihilate them [[H6]] swiftly, [[H4118]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has told you. [[H1696]] 
4 When the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has driven them out [[H1920]] before you, [[H6440]] do not [[H408]] say [[H559]] in your heart, [[H3824]] “Because of my righteousness [[H6666]] the LORD [[H3068]] has brought me in [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] this [[H2063]] land.” [[H776]] Rather, the LORD [[H3068]] will drive out [[H3423]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] before you [[H6440]] because of their wickedness. [[H7564]] 
5 It is not [[H3808]] by your righteousness [[H6666]] or uprightness [[H3476]] of heart [[H3824]] that you [[H859]] are going in [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] their land, [[H776]] but [it is] because [[H3588]] of their wickedness [[H7564]] that the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will drive out [[H3423]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] before you, [[H6440]] to [[H4616]] keep [[H6965]] the promise [[H1697]] He [[H3068]] swore [[H7650]] to your fathers, [[H1]] to Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob. [[H3290]] 
6 Understand, then, [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it is not [[H3808]] by your righteousness [[H6666]] that the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you this [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] to possess, [[H3423]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a stiff-necked [[H7186]] people. [[H5971]] 
7 Remember this [[H2142]] and never [[H408]] forget [[H7911]] how [[H834]] you provoked [[H7107]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] From [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] you left [[H3318]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] until [[H5704]] you reached [[H935]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] you have been [[H1961]] rebelling [[H4784]] against [[H5973]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
8 At Horeb [[H2722]] you provoked [[H7107]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He [[H3068]] was angry enough [[H599]] to destroy [[H8045]] you. [[H853]] 
9 When I went up [[H5927]] on the mountain [[H2022]] to receive [[H3947]] the tablets [[H3871]] of stone, [[H68]] the tablets [[H3871]] of the covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] made [[H3772]] with you, [[H5973]] I stayed [[H3427]] on the mountain [[H2022]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights. [[H3915]] I ate [[H398]] no [[H3808]] bread [[H3899]] and drank [[H8354]] no [[H3808]] water. [[H4325]] 
10 Then the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] me the two [[H8147]] stone [[H68]] tablets, [[H3871]] inscribed [[H3789]] by the finger [[H676]] of God [[H430]] with the exact [[H3605]] words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to you [[H5973]] out of [[H8432]] the fire [[H784]] on the mountain [[H2022]] on the day [[H3117]] of the assembly. [[H6951]] 
11 And [[H1961]] at the end [[H7093]] of forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights, [[H3915]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] me the two [[H8147]] stone [[H68]] tablets, [[H3871]] the tablets [[H3871]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] 
12 and the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Get up [[H6965]] and go down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] here [[H2088]] at once, [[H4118]] for [[H3588]] your people [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] you brought [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] have corrupted [themselves]. [[H7843]] How quickly [[H4118]] they have turned aside [[H5493]] from the way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] I commanded them; [[H6680]] they have made [[H6213]] for themselves  a molten image. [[H4541]] 
13 The LORD [[H3068]] also said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “I have seen [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and indeed, [[H2009]] they [[H1931]] are a stiff-necked [[H7186]] people. [[H5971]] 
14 Let Me alone, [[H7503]] so that I may destroy them [[H8045]] and blot out [[H4229]] their name [[H8034]] from [[H4480]] under [[H8478]] heaven. [[H8064]] Then I will make [[H6213]] you into a nation [[H1471]] mightier [[H6099]] and greater [[H7227]] than they.” [[H4480]] 
15 So I went back [[H6437]] down [[H3381]] the mountain [[H2022]] while it [[H2022]] was blazing [[H1197]] with fire, [[H784]] with the two [[H8147]] tablets [[H3871]] of the covenant [[H1285]] in [[H5921]] my hands. [[H3027]] 
16 And I saw [[H7200]] how [[H2009]] you had sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] you had made [[H6213]] for yourselves  a molten [[H4541]] calf. [[H5695]] You had turned aside [[H5493]] quickly [[H4118]] from [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded you. [[H6680]] 
17 So I took hold [[H8610]] of the two [[H8147]] tablets [[H3871]] and threw [[H7993]] them out of [[H5921]] my hands, [[H3027]] shattering [[H7665]] them before your eyes. [[H5869]] 
18 Then I fell down [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] for forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights, [[H3915]] as [I had done] the first time. [[H7223]] I did not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] or drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the sin [[H2403]] you had committed [[H2398]] in doing [[H6213]] what was evil [[H7451]] in the LORD’s [[H3068]] sight [[H5869]] and provoking Him to anger. [[H3707]] 
19 For [[H3588]] I was afraid [[H3025]] of the anger [[H639]] and wrath [[H2534]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had directed [[H7107]] against you, [[H5921]] enough to destroy you. [[H8045]] But the LORD [[H3068]] listened [[H8085]] to me [[H413]] this [[H1931]] time [[H6471]] as well. [[H1571]] 
20 The LORD [[H3068]] was angry [[H599]] enough [[H3966]] with Aaron [[H175]] to destroy him, [[H8045]] but at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I also [[H1571]] prayed [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] Aaron. [[H175]] 
21 And [[H853]] I took [[H3947]] that [[H834]] sinful thing, [[H2403]] the calf [[H5695]] you had made, [[H6213]] and burned it [[H8313]] in the fire. [[H784]] Then I crushed it [[H3807]] [and] ground [[H2912]] it to [[H5704]] powder [[H1851]] as fine as dust, [[H6083]] and I cast [[H7993]] it [[H6083]] into [[H413]] the stream [[H5158]] that came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mountain. [[H2022]] 
22 You continued to provoke [[H7107]] the LORD [[H3068]] at Taberah, [[H8404]] Massah, [[H4532]] and Kibroth-hattaavah. [[H6914]] 
23 And when the LORD [[H3068]] sent you out [[H7971]] from Kadesh-barnea, [[H6947]] He said, [[H559]] “Go up [[H5927]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] I have given [[H5414]] you.”  But you rebelled [[H4784]] against the command [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] You neither [[H3808]] believed [Him] [[H539]] nor [[H3808]] obeyed Him. [[H8085]] 
24 You have been [[H1961]] rebelling [[H4784]] against [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] from the day [[H3117]] I knew you. [[H3045]] 
25 So I fell down [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] for forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and [[H853]] forty [[H705]] nights [[H3915]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] He would destroy [[H8045]] you. [[H853]] 
26 And I prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] “O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] do not [[H408]] destroy [[H7843]] Your people, [[H5971]] Your inheritance, [[H5159]] whom [[H834]] You redeemed [[H6299]] through Your greatness [[H1433]] and brought out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand. [[H3027]] 
27 Remember [[H2142]] Your servants [[H5650]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob. [[H3290]] Overlook [[H408]] the stubbornness [[H7190]] of this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] their wickedness [[H7562]] and sin. [[H2403]] 
28 Otherwise, [[H6435]] those in the land [[H776]] from which [[H834]] you brought us out [[H3318]] will say, [[H559]] ‘Because the LORD [[H3068]] was not [[H1097]] able [[H3201]] to bring [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] He had promised them, [[H1696]] and because He hated [[H8135]] them, [[H853]] He has brought them out [[H3318]] to kill them [[H4191]] in the wilderness.’ [[H4057]] 
29 But they [[H1992]] are Your people, [[H5971]] Your inheritance, [[H5159]] whom [[H834]] You brought out [[H3318]] by Your great [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and outstretched [[H5186]] arm.” [[H2220]]
