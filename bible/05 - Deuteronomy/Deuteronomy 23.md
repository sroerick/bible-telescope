# Deuteronomy 23
[[Deuteronomy 22|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 24|→]]
1 No man [[H3808]] with crushed [[H6481]] or severed [[H3772]] genitals [[H8212]] may enter [[H935]] the assembly [[H6951]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 No [[H3808]] one of illegitimate birth [[H4464]] may enter [[H935]] the assembly [[H6951]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] nor may any of his descendants, [[H3808]] even [[H1571]] to the tenth [[H6224]] generation. [[H1755]] 
3 No [[H3808]] Ammonite [[H5984]] or Moabite [[H4125]] or any of their descendants [[H3808]] may enter [[H935]] the assembly [[H6951]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] even [[H1571]] to the tenth [[H6224]] generation. [[H1755]] 
4 For [[H5921]] they did not [[H3808]] meet [[H6923]] you with food [[H3899]] and water [[H4325]] on your way [[H1870]] out of [[H3318]] Egypt, [[H4714]] [and] [[H834]] they hired [[H7936]] Balaam [[H1109]] son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] from Pethor [[H6604]] in Aram-naharaim [[H763]] to curse you. [[H7043]] 
5 Yet the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] and the LORD [[H3068]] turned [[H2015]] the curse [[H7045]] into a blessing [[H1293]] for you,  because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] loves you. [[H157]] 
6 You are not to [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] peace [[H7965]] or prosperity from them [[H2896]] as long as you live. [[H3605]] 
7 Do not [[H3808]] despise [[H8581]] an Edomite, [[H130]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is your brother. [[H251]] Do not [[H3808]] despise [[H8581]] an Egyptian, [[H4713]] because [[H3588]] you lived [[H1961]] as a foreigner [[H1616]] in his land. [[H776]] 
8 The third [[H7992]] generation [[H1755]] of children [[H1121]] born [[H3205]] to them  may enter [[H935]] the assembly [[H6951]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
9 When [[H3588]] you are encamped [[H3318]] against [[H5921]] your enemies, [[H341]] then you shall keep yourself [[H8104]] from every [[H3605]] wicked [[H7451]] thing. [[H1697]] 
10 If [[H3588]] any man [[H376]] among you  becomes [[H1961]] unclean [[H2889]] because of a nocturnal [[H3915]] emission, [[H7137]] he must leave [[H3318]] the camp [[H4264]] [and] stay [[H935]] outside. [[H2351]] 
11 When evening [[H6153]] approaches, [[H6437]] he must wash [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and when the sun [[H8121]] sets [[H935]] he may return [[H935]] to [[H413]] the camp. [[H4264]] 
12 You must have [[H1961]] a place [[H3027]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] to go [[H3318]] [and] relieve yourself. [[H8033]] 
13 And you must have [[H1961]] a digging tool [[H3489]] in [[H5921]] your equipment [[H240]] so that [[H1961]] when you relieve yourself [[H3427]] you can dig a hole [[H2658]] and cover up [[H3680]] your excrement. [[H6627]] 
14 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] walks [[H1980]] throughout [[H7130]] your camp [[H4264]] to protect you [[H5337]] and deliver [[H5414]] your enemies [[H341]] to you. [[H6440]] Your camp [[H4264]] must be [[H1961]] holy, [[H6918]] lest [[H3808]] He see [[H7200]] anything [[H1697]] unclean [[H6172]] among you  and turn away [[H7725]] from you. [[H310]] 
15 Do not [[H3808]] return [[H5462]] a slave [[H5650]] to [[H413]] his master [[H113]] if he has taken refuge [[H5337]] with you. [[H413]] 
16 Let him live [[H3427]] among you [[H7130]] wherever [[H4725]] he chooses, [[H977]] in [[H259]] the town [[H8179]] of his pleasing. [[H2896]] Do not [[H3808]] oppress him. [[H3238]] 
17 No [[H3808]] daughter [[H1323]] or [[H3808]] son [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] is to be [[H1961]] a cult prostitute. [[H6945]] 
18 You must not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] the wages [[H868]] of a prostitute, whether female [[H2181]] or male, [[H3611]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] to fulfill any [[H3605]] vow, [[H5088]] because [[H3588]] both [[H8147]] are detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
19 Do not [[H3808]] charge [[H5391]] your brother [[H251]] interest [[H5392]] on money, [[H3701]] food, [[H400]] or any [[H3605]] other [[H1697]] type of loan. [[H5391]] 
20 You may charge a foreigner [[H5237]] interest, [[H5391]] but not [[H3808]] your brother, [[H251]] so that [[H4616]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] may bless you [[H1288]] in everything [[H3605]] to which you put [[H4916]] your hand [[H3027]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to possess. [[H3423]] 
21 If [[H3588]] you make [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] do not [[H3808]] be slow to keep it, [[H309]] because [[H3588]] He [[H3068]] will surely require it [[H1875]] of you, [[H5973]] and you will be [[H1961]] guilty of sin. [[H2399]] 
22 But if [[H3588]] you refrain [[H2308]] from making a vow, [[H5087]] you will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] guilty of sin. [[H2399]] 
23 Be careful [[H8104]] to follow through [[H6213]] on what comes [[H4161]] from your lips, [[H8193]] because [[H834]] you have freely [[H5071]] vowed [[H5087]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] with your own mouth. [[H6310]] 
24 When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] your neighbor’s [[H7453]] vineyard, [[H3754]] you may eat [[H398]] your [[H5315]] fill of [[H7648]] grapes, [[H6025]] but you must not [[H3808]] put [[H5414]] any in [[H413]] your basket. [[H3627]] 
25 When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] your neighbor’s [[H7453]] grainfield, [[H7054]] you may pluck [[H6998]] the heads of grain [[H4425]] with your hand, [[H3027]] but you must not [[H3808]] put [[H5130]] a sickle [[H2770]] to [[H5921]] your neighbor’s [[H7453]] grain. [[H7054]]
