# Deuteronomy 28
[[Deuteronomy 27|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 29|→]]
1 Now [[H1961]] if [[H518]] you faithfully obey [[H8085]] the voice of [[H6963]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and are careful [[H8104]] to follow [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] His commandments [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving you today, [[H6680]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will set you [[H5414]] high above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
2 All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] blessings [[H1293]] will come [[H935]] upon you [[H5921]] and overtake you, [[H5381]] if [[H3588]] you will obey [[H8085]] the voice of [[H6963]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]] 
3 You [[H859]] will be blessed [[H1288]] in the city [[H5892]] and blessed [[H1288]] in the country. [[H7704]] 
4 The fruit of [[H6529]] your womb [[H990]] will be blessed, [[H1288]] and the produce [[H6529]] of your land, [[H127]] the offspring [[H6529]] of your livestock, [[H929]] the calves [[H7698]] of your herds, [[H504]] and the lambs [[H6251]] of your flocks. [[H6629]] 
5 Your basket [[H2935]] and kneading bowl [[H4863]] will be blessed. [[H1288]] 
6 You [[H859]] will be blessed [[H1288]] when you come in [[H935]] and blessed [[H1288]] when you [[H859]] go out. [[H3318]] 
7 The LORD [[H3068]] will cause [[H5414]] the enemies [[H341]] who rise up [[H6965]] against you [[H5921]] to be defeated [[H5062]] before you. [[H6440]] They will march out [[H3318]] against [[H413]] you in one [[H259]] direction [[H1870]] but flee [[H5127]] from you [[H6440]] in seven. [[H7651]] 
8 The LORD [[H3068]] will decree [[H6680]] a blessing [[H1293]] on your barns [[H618]] and on everything [[H3605]] to which you put [[H4916]] your hand; [[H3027]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will bless you [[H1288]] in the land [[H776]] He is giving [[H5414]] you.  
9 The LORD [[H3068]] will establish you [[H6965]] as His holy [[H6918]] people, [[H5971]] just as [[H834]] He has sworn [[H7650]] to you,  if [[H3588]] you keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and walk [[H1980]] in His ways. [[H1870]] 
10 Then all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] will see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] you are called [[H7121]] by the name of [[H8034]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and they will stand in awe [[H3372]] of you. [[H4480]] 
11 The LORD [[H3068]] will make you prosper [[H3498]] abundantly [[H2896]] in the fruit of [[H6529]] your womb, [[H990]] the offspring [[H6529]] of your livestock, [[H929]] and the produce [[H6529]] of your land, [[H127]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] swore [[H7650]] to your fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] you.  
12 The LORD [[H3068]] will open [[H6605]] the heavens, [[H8064]] His abundant [[H2896]] storehouse, [[H214]] to send [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] to your land [[H776]] in season [[H6256]] and to bless [[H1288]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of your hands. [[H3027]] You will lend [[H3867]] to many [[H7227]] nations, [[H1471]] but [[H859]] borrow [[H3867]] from none. [[H3808]] 
13 The LORD [[H3068]] will make [[H5414]] you the head [[H7218]] and not [[H3808]] the tail; [[H2180]] you will only [[H7535]] move upward [[H4605]] and never [[H3808]] downward, [[H4295]] if [[H3588]] you hear [[H8085]] and carefully [[H8104]] follow [[H6213]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] am giving [[H6680]] you today. [[H3117]] 
14 Do not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left [[H8040]] from any of [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you [[H853]] today, [[H3117]] and do not go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve them. [[H5647]] 
15 If, however, [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] by carefully [[H8104]] following [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] His commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2708]] I [[H595]] am giving you today, [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] curses [[H7045]] will come [[H935]] upon you [[H5921]] and overtake you: [[H5381]] 
16 You [[H859]] will be cursed [[H779]] in the city [[H5892]] and cursed [[H779]] in the country. [[H7704]] 
17 Your basket [[H2935]] and kneading bowl [[H4863]] will be cursed. [[H779]] 
18 The fruit [[H6529]] of your womb [[H990]] will be cursed, [[H779]] and the produce [[H6529]] of your land, [[H127]] the calves [[H7698]] of your herds, [[H504]] and the lambs [[H6251]] of your flocks. [[H6629]] 
19 You [[H859]] will be cursed [[H779]] when you come in [[H935]] and cursed [[H779]] when you [[H859]] go out. [[H3318]] 
20 The LORD [[H3068]] will send [[H7971]] curses [[H3994]] upon you,  confusion [[H4103]] and [[H853]] rebuke [[H4045]] in all [[H3605]] to which you put [[H4916]] your hand, [[H3027]] until [[H5704]] you are destroyed [[H8045]] and quickly [[H4118]] perish [[H6]] because of [[H6440]] the wickedness [[H7455]] you have committed [[H4611]] in forsaking Him. [[H5800]] 
21 The LORD [[H3068]] will make the pestilence [[H1698]] cling [[H1692]] to you  until [[H5704]] He has exterminated [[H3615]] you [[H853]] from [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to possess. [[H3423]] 
22 The LORD [[H3068]] will strike you [[H5221]] with wasting disease, [[H7829]] with fever [[H6920]] and inflammation, [[H1816]] with severe heat [[H2746]] and drought, [[H2719]] with blight [[H7711]] and mildew; [[H3420]] these will pursue [[H7291]] you until [[H5704]] you perish. [[H6]] 
23 The sky [[H8064]] over [[H5921]] your head [[H7218]] will be [[H1961]] bronze, [[H5178]] and the earth [[H776]] beneath you [[H8478]] iron. [[H1270]] 
24 The LORD [[H3068]] will turn [[H5414]] the rain [[H4306]] of your land [[H776]] into dust [[H80]] and powder; [[H6083]] it will descend [[H3381]] on you [[H5921]] from [[H4480]] the sky [[H8064]] until [[H5704]] you are destroyed. [[H8045]] 
25 The LORD [[H3068]] will cause [[H5414]] you to be defeated [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] your enemies. [[H341]] You will march out [[H3318]] against them [[H413]] in one [[H259]] direction [[H1870]] but flee [[H5127]] from them [[H6440]] in seven. [[H7651]] You will be [[H1961]] an object of horror [[H2189]] to all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
26 Your corpses [[H5038]] will be [[H1961]] food [[H3978]] for all [[H3605]] the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] and beasts of [[H929]] the earth, [[H776]] with no [[H369]] one to scare them away. [[H2729]] 
27 The LORD [[H3068]] will afflict [[H5221]] you with the boils [[H7822]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] with tumors [[H6076]] and scabs [[H1618]] and itch, [[H2775]] from which [[H834]] you cannot [[H3808]] be cured. [[H7495]] 
28 The LORD [[H3068]] will afflict [[H5221]] you with madness, [[H7697]] blindness, [[H5788]] and confusion [[H8541]] of mind, [[H3824]] 
29 so that at noon [[H6672]] you will [[H1961]] grope about [[H4959]] like [[H834]] a blind man [[H5787]] in the darkness. [[H653]] You will not [[H3808]] prosper [[H6743]] in your ways. [[H1870]] Day after day [[H3605]] you will be [[H1961]] oppressed [[H6231]] and plundered, [[H1497]] with no one [[H369]] to save you. [[H3467]] 
30 You will be pledged in marriage [[H781]] to a woman, [[H802]] but another [[H312]] man [[H376]] will violate her. [[H7693]] You will build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] but not [[H3808]] live in it. [[H3427]] You will plant [[H5193]] a vineyard [[H3754]] but not [[H3808]] enjoy its fruit. [[H2490]] 
31 Your ox [[H7794]] will be slaughtered [[H2873]] before your eyes, [[H5869]] but you will not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] any of it. [[H4480]] Your donkey [[H2543]] will be taken away [[H1497]] and not [[H3808]] returned to you. [[H7725]] Your flock [[H6629]] will be given [[H5414]] to your enemies, [[H341]] and no [[H369]] one will help you. [[H3467]] 
32 Your sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] will be given [[H5414]] to another [[H312]] nation, [[H5971]] while your eyes [[H5869]] grow weary [[H3616]] looking [[H7200]] for them [[H413]] day after day, [[H3117]] with no [[H369]] power in [[H410]] your hand. [[H3027]] 
33 A people [[H5971]] you do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] will eat [[H398]] the produce [[H6529]] of your land [[H127]] and of all [[H3605]] your toil. [[H3018]] All [[H3605]] your days [[H3117]] you will be [[H1961]] oppressed [[H6231]] and crushed. [[H7533]] 
34 You will be [[H1961]] driven mad [[H7696]] by the sights [[H4758]] you see. [[H7200]] 
35 The LORD [[H3068]] will afflict you [[H5221]] with painful, [[H7451]] incurable [[H3808]] boils [[H7822]] on [[H5921]] your knees [[H1290]] and thighs, [[H7785]] from the soles [[H3709]] of your feet [[H7272]] to [[H5704]] the top of your head. [[H6936]] 
36 The LORD [[H3068]] will bring [[H1980]] you [[H853]] and [[H853]] the king [[H4428]] you appoint [[H6965]] to [[H413]] a nation [[H1471]] neither you [[H859]] nor [[H3808]] your fathers [[H1]] have known, [[H3045]] and there [[H8033]] you will worship [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] [gods] of wood [[H6086]] and stone. [[H68]] 
37 You will become [[H1961]] an object of horror, [[H8047]] scorn, [[H4912]] and ridicule [[H8148]] among all [[H3605]] the nations [[H5971]] to which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] will drive you. [[H5090]] 
38 You will sow [[H3318]] much [[H7227]] seed [[H2233]] in the field [[H7704]] but harvest [[H622]] little, [[H4592]] because [[H3588]] the locust [[H697]] will consume it. [[H2628]] 
39 You will plant [[H5193]] and cultivate [[H5647]] vineyards, [[H3754]] but will neither [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] nor [[H3808]] gather [the grapes], [[H103]] because [[H3588]] worms [[H8438]] will eat them. [[H398]] 
40 You will have [[H1961]] olive trees [[H2132]] throughout [[H3605]] your territory, [[H1366]] but you will never [[H3808]] anoint [[H5480]] yourself with oil, [[H8081]] because [[H3588]] the olives [[H2132]] will drop off. [[H5394]] 
41 You will father [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] but they will not [[H3808]] remain [[H1961]] yours,  because [[H3588]] they will go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]] 
42 Swarms of locusts [[H6767]] will consume [[H3423]] all [[H3605]] your trees [[H6086]] and the produce [[H6529]] of your land. [[H127]] 
43 The foreigner living [[H1616]] among you [[H7130]] will rise [[H5927]] higher [[H4605]] and higher [[H4605]] above you, [[H5921]] while you [[H859]] sink down [[H3381]] lower [[H4295]] and lower. [[H4295]] 
44 He [[H1931]] will lend to you, [[H3867]] but you [[H859]] will not [[H3808]] lend to him. [[H3867]] He [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] the head, [[H7218]] and you [[H859]] will be [[H1961]] the tail. [[H2180]] 
45 All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] curses [[H7045]] will come [[H935]] upon you. [[H5921]] They will pursue you [[H7291]] and overtake you [[H5381]] until [[H5704]] you are destroyed, [[H8045]] since [[H3588]] you did not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2708]] He gave you. [[H6680]] 
46 These curses will be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] and a wonder [[H4159]] upon you  and your descendants [[H2233]] forever. [[H5704]] 
47 Because [[H8478]] you did not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] with joy [[H8057]] and gladness [[H2898]] of heart [[H3824]] in all [[H3605]] your abundance, [[H7230]] 
48 you will serve [[H5647]] your enemies [[H341]] the LORD [[H3068]] will send against you [[H7971]] in famine, [[H7458]] thirst, [[H6772]] nakedness, [[H5903]] and destitution. [[H2640]] He will place [[H5414]] an iron [[H1270]] yoke [[H5923]] on [[H5921]] your neck [[H6677]] until [[H5704]] He has destroyed [[H8045]] you. [[H853]] 
49 The LORD [[H3068]] will bring [[H5375]] a nation [[H1471]] from afar, [[H7350]] from the ends of [[H7097]] the earth, [[H776]] to swoop down [[H1675]] upon you [[H5921]] like [[H834]] an eagle, [[H5404]] a nation [[H1471]] whose [[H834]] language [[H3956]] you will not [[H3808]] understand, [[H8085]] 
50 a ruthless [[H5794]] nation [[H1471]] with no [[H3808]] respect [[H5375]] for the old [[H2205]] and no [[H3808]] pity [[H2603]] for the young. [[H5288]] 
51 They will eat [[H398]] the offspring [[H6529]] of your livestock [[H929]] and the produce [[H6529]] of your land [[H127]] until [[H5704]] you are destroyed. [[H8045]] They will leave [[H7604]] you  no [[H3808]] grain [[H1715]] or new wine [[H8492]] or oil, [[H3323]] no calves [[H7698]] of your herds [[H504]] or lambs [[H6251]] of your flocks, [[H6629]] until [[H5704]] they have caused you to perish. [[H6]] 
52 They will besiege [[H6887]] all [[H3605]] your cities, [[H8179]] until [[H5704]] the high [[H1364]] and fortified [[H1219]] walls [[H2346]] in which [[H834]] you [[H859]] trust [[H982]] have fallen [[H3381]] in all [[H3605]] the land. [[H776]] They will besiege [[H6887]] all [[H3605]] your cities [[H8179]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has given you. [[H5414]] 
53 During the siege [[H4692]] and hardship [[H4689]] your enemy [[H341]] will impose [[H6693]] on you,  you will eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of your womb, [[H990]] the flesh [[H1320]] of your sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has given [[H5414]] you.  
54 The most [[H3966]] gentle [[H7390]] and refined [[H6028]] man [[H376]] among you  will begrudge [[H7489]] his brother, [[H251]] the wife [[H802]] he embraces, [[H2436]] and the rest [[H3499]] of his children [[H1121]] who have survived, [[H3498]] 
55 refusing to share [[H5414]] with any [[H259]] of them [[H1992]] the flesh [[H1320]] of his children [[H1121]] that [[H834]] he will eat [[H398]] because he has nothing [[H1097]] left [[H7604]] in the siege [[H4692]] and hardship [[H4689]] your enemy [[H341]] will impose [[H6693]] on all [[H3605]] your cities. [[H8179]] 
56 The most gentle [[H7390]] and refined woman [[H6028]] among you,  so gentle [[H7391]] and refined [[H6026]] she would not [[H3808]] venture [[H5254]] to set [[H3322]] the sole [[H3709]] of her foot [[H7272]] on [[H5921]] the ground, [[H776]] will begrudge [[H7489]] the husband [[H376]] she embraces [[H2436]] and her son [[H1121]] and daughter [[H1323]] 
57 the afterbirth [[H7988]] that comes [[H3318]] from between [[H996]] her legs [[H7272]] and the children [[H1121]] she bears, [[H3205]] because [[H3588]] she will secretly [[H5643]] eat [[H398]] them for lack [[H2640]] of anything else [[H3605]] in the siege [[H4692]] and dire straits [[H4689]] your enemy [[H341]] will impose [[H6693]] on you  in all your cities. [[H8179]] 
58 If [[H518]] you are not [[H3808]] careful [[H8104]] to observe [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] which are written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book, [[H5612]] that you may fear [[H3372]] this glorious [[H3513]] and awesome [[H3372]] name— [[H8034]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God— [[H430]] 
59 He [[H3068]] {will bring} upon you and your descendants [[H2233]] extraordinary [[H6381]] disasters, [[H4347]] severe [[H1419]] and lasting [[H539]] plagues, [[H4347]] and terrible [[H7451]] and chronic [[H539]] sicknesses. [[H2483]] 
60 He will afflict you again [[H7725]] with all [[H3605]] the diseases [[H4064]] you dreaded [[H3025]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and they will cling to you. [[H1692]] 
61 The LORD [[H3068]] will also [[H1571]] bring [[H5927]] upon you [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] sickness [[H2483]] and plague [[H4347]] not [[H3808]] recorded [[H3789]] in this [[H2063]] Book [[H5612]] of the Law, [[H8451]] until [[H5704]] you are destroyed. [[H8045]] 
62 You who were [[H1961]] as numerous [[H7230]] as the stars [[H3556]] in the sky [[H8064]] will be left [[H7604]] few [[H4592]] in number, [[H4962]] because [[H3588]] you would not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the voice of [[H6963]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
63 Just as [[H834]] it pleased [[H7797]] the LORD [[H3068]] to make you prosper [[H3190]] and to multiply you, [[H7235]] so also [[H3651]] it will please [[H7797]] Him [[H3068]] to exterminate [[H6]] you [[H853]] and destroy [[H8045]] you. [[H853]] And you will be uprooted [[H5255]] from [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to possess. [[H3423]] 
64 Then the LORD [[H3068]] will scatter [[H6327]] you among all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H5971]] from one end [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] to [[H5704]] the other, [[H7097]] and there [[H8033]] you will worship [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] [gods] of wood [[H6086]] and stone, [[H68]] which [[H834]] neither you [[H859]] nor [[H3808]] your fathers [[H1]] have known. [[H3045]] 
65 Among those [[H1992]] nations [[H1471]] you will find no [[H3808]] repose, [[H7280]] not even [[H3808]] a resting place [[H4494]] for the sole [[H3709]] of your foot. [[H7272]] There [[H8033]] the LORD [[H3068]] will give [[H5414]] you a trembling [[H7268]] heart, [[H3820]] failing [[H3631]] eyes, [[H5869]] and a despairing [[H1671]] soul. [[H5315]] 
66 So your life [[H2416]] will hang in doubt [[H8511]] before you, [[H5048]] and you will be afraid [[H6342]] night [[H3915]] and day, [[H3119]] never [[H3808]] certain [[H539]] of survival. [[H2416]] 
67 In the morning [[H1242]] you will say, [[H559]] ‘If only [[H4310]] it were evening!’ [[H6153]] and in the evening [[H6153]] you will say, [[H559]] ‘If only [[H4310]] it were morning!’— [[H1242]] because of the dread [[H6343]] in your hearts [[H3824]] of [[H834]] the terrifying [[H6342]] sights [[H4758]] you will see. [[H7200]] 
68 The LORD [[H3068]] will return you [[H7725]] to Egypt [[H4714]] in ships [[H591]] by a route [[H1870]] that [[H834]] I said [[H559]] you should never [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] again. [[H3254]] There [[H8033]] you will sell [[H4376]] yourselves to your enemies [[H341]] as male [[H5650]] and female slaves, [[H8198]] but no [[H369]] one will buy you.” [[H7069]]
