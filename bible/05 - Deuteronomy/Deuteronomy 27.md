# Deuteronomy 27
[[Deuteronomy 26|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 28|→]]
1 Then Moses [[H4872]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] commanded [[H6680]] the people, [[H5971]] “Keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving [[H6680]] you [[H853]] today. [[H3117]] 
2 And [[H1961]] on the day [[H3117]] you cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you, [[H5414]] you are to set up [[H6965]] large [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] and coat [[H7874]] them [[H853]] with plaster. [[H7874]] 
3 Write [[H3789]] on them [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] when you have crossed over [[H5674]] to [[H4616]] enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you, [[H5414]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] just as [[H834]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] has promised you. [[H1696]] 
4 And [[H1961]] when you have crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] you are to set up [[H6965]] these [[H428]] stones [[H68]] on Mount [[H2022]] Ebal, [[H5858]] as [[H834]] I [[H595]] am commanding you today, [[H6680]] and you are to coat [[H7874]] them [[H853]] with plaster. [[H7874]] 
5 Moreover, you shall build [[H1129]] there [[H8033]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] an altar of [[H4196]] stones. [[H68]] You must not [[H3808]] use [[H5130]] any iron tool [[H1270]] on them. [[H5921]] 
6 You shall build [[H1129]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] with uncut [[H8003]] stones [[H68]] and offer [[H5927]] upon it [[H5921]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
7 There [[H8033]] you are to sacrifice [[H2076]] [your] peace offerings, [[H8002]] eating them [[H398]] and rejoicing [[H8055]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
8 And you shall write [[H3789]] distinctly [[H874]] upon [[H5921]] these stones [[H68]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law.” [[H8451]] 
9 Then Moses [[H4872]] and the Levitical [[H3881]] priests [[H3548]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]] “Be silent, [[H5535]] O Israel, [[H3478]] and listen! [[H8085]] This [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] you have become [[H1961]] the people [[H5971]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
10 You shall therefore obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] and follow [[H6213]] His commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2706]] I [[H595]] am giving you today.” [[H6680]] 
11 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] the people: [[H5971]] 
12 “When you have crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] these [tribes] [[H428]] shall stand [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Gerizim [[H1630]] to bless [[H1288]] the people: [[H5971]] Simeon, [[H8095]] Levi, [[H3878]] Judah, [[H3063]] Issachar, [[H3485]] Joseph, [[H3130]] and Benjamin. [[H1144]] 
13 And these [tribes] [[H428]] shall stand [[H5975]] on Mount [[H2022]] Ebal [[H5858]] to [[H5921]] deliver the curse: [[H7045]] Reuben, [[H7205]] Gad, [[H1410]] Asher, [[H836]] Zebulun, [[H2074]] Dan, [[H1835]] and Naphtali. [[H5321]] 
14 Then the Levites [[H3881]] shall proclaim [[H559]] in a loud [[H7311]] voice [[H6963]] to [[H413]] every [[H3605]] Israelite: [[H376]] 
15 ‘Cursed [is] [[H779]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] makes [[H6213]] a carved idol [[H6459]] or molten image— [[H4541]] which is detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the work of [[H4639]] the hands [[H3027]] of a craftsman— [[H2796]] and sets it up [[H7760]] in secret.’ [[H5643]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H6030]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
16 ‘Cursed [is] [[H779]] he who dishonors [[H7034]] his father [[H1]] or mother.’ [[H517]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
17 ‘Cursed [is] [[H779]] he who moves [[H5253]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] boundary stone.’ [[H1366]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
18 ‘Cursed is [[H779]] he who lets a blind man [[H5787]] wander [[H7686]] in the road.’ [[H1870]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
19 ‘Cursed is [[H779]] he who withholds [[H5186]] justice [[H4941]] from the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] or the widow.’ [[H490]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
20 ‘Cursed is [[H779]] he who sleeps [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his father’s [[H1]] wife, [[H802]] for [[H3588]] he has violated [[H1540]] his father’s [[H1]] marriage bed.’ [[H3671]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
21 ‘Cursed is [[H779]] he who has sexual relations [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] any [[H3605]] animal.’ [[H929]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
22 ‘Cursed is [[H779]] he who sleeps [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his sister, [[H269]] the daughter of [[H1323]] his father [[H1]] or [[H176]] the daughter of [[H1323]] his mother.’ [[H517]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
23 ‘Cursed is [[H779]] he who sleeps [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his mother-in-law.’ [[H2859]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
24 ‘Cursed is [[H779]] he who strikes down [[H5221]] his neighbor [[H7453]] in secret.’ [[H5643]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
25 ‘Cursed is [[H779]] he who accepts [[H3947]] a bribe [[H7810]] to kill [[H5221]] an innocent [[H5355]] person.’ [[H5315]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’ [[H543]] 
26 ‘Cursed is [[H779]] he who [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] put [[H6965]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] into practice.’ [[H6213]] And {let} all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘Amen!’” [[H543]]
