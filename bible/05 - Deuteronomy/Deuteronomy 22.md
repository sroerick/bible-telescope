# Deuteronomy 22
[[Deuteronomy 21|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 23|→]]
1 If you see [[H7200]] your brother’s [[H251]] ox [[H7794]] or [[H176]] sheep [[H7716]] straying, [[H5080]] you must not [[H3808]] ignore it; [[H5956]] be sure to return it [[H7725]] to your brother. [[H251]] 
2 If [[H518]] your brother [[H251]] does not [[H3808]] live near you, [[H7138]] or if you do not [[H3808]] know who he is, [[H3045]] you are to take [[H622]] the animal [[H413]] home [[H1004]] to remain [[H1961]] with you [[H5973]] until [[H5704]] your brother [[H251]] comes seeking it; [[H1875]] then you can return it to him. [[H7725]] 
3 And you shall do [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] for his donkey, [[H2543]] his cloak, [[H8071]] or anything [[H3605]] your brother [[H251]] has lost [[H9]] and you have found. [[H4672]] You must [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] ignore it. [[H5956]] 
4 If you see [[H7200]] your brother’s [[H251]] donkey [[H2543]] or [[H176]] ox [[H7794]] fallen [[H5307]] on the road, [[H1870]] you must not [[H3808]] ignore it; [[H5956]] you must help him lift it up. [[H6965]] 
5 A woman [[H802]] must not [[H3808]] wear [[H1961]] men’s [[H1397]] clothing, [[H3627]] and a man [[H1397]] must not [[H3808]] wear [[H3847]] women’s [[H802]] clothing, [[H8071]] for [[H3588]] whoever [[H3605]] does [[H6213]] these things [[H428]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD [[H3069]] your God. [[H430]] 
6 If [[H3588]] you come across [[H7122]] a bird’s [[H6833]] nest [[H7064]] with chicks [[H667]] or [[H176]] eggs, [[H1000]] either in a tree [[H6086]] or [[H176]] on [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] along the road, [[H1870]] and the mother [[H517]] is sitting [[H7257]] on [[H5921]] the chicks [[H667]] or [[H176]] eggs, [[H1000]] you must not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] the mother [[H517]] along with [[H5921]] the young. [[H1121]] 
7 You may take [[H3947]] the young, [[H1121]] but be sure to let the mother [[H517]] go, [[H7971]] so that [[H4616]] it may be well [[H3190]] with you  and that you may prolong [[H748]] your days. [[H3117]] 
8 If [[H3588]] you build [[H1129]] a new [[H2319]] house, [[H1004]] you are to construct [[H6213]] a railing [[H4624]] around your roof, [[H1406]] so that you do not [[H3808]] bring [[H7760]] bloodguilt [[H1818]] on your house [[H1004]] if [[H3588]] someone [[H5307]] falls [[H5307]] from it. [[H4480]] 
9 Do not [[H3808]] plant [[H2232]] your vineyard [[H3754]] with two types of seed, [[H3610]] or [[H6435]] the entire harvest [[H4395]] will be defiled— [[H6942]] both the crop [[H2233]] you plant [[H2232]] and the fruit [[H8393]] of your vineyard. [[H3754]] 
10 Do not [[H3808]] plow [[H2790]] with an ox [[H7794]] and a donkey [[H2543]] [yoked] together. [[H3162]] 
11 Do not [[H3808]] wear [[H3847]] clothes [[H8162]] of wool [[H6785]] and linen [[H6593]] woven together. [[H3162]] 
12 You are to make [[H6213]] tassels [[H1434]] on [[H5921]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H3671]] of the cloak [[H3682]] you wear. [[H3680]] 
13 Suppose [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] marries [[H3947]] a woman, [[H802]] has relations with [[H935]] her, [[H413]] and comes to hate her, [[H8130]] 
14 and then accuses her [[H7760]] of shameful conduct [[H5949]] and gives [[H3318]] her a bad [[H7451]] name, [[H8034]] saying, [[H559]] “I married [[H3947]] this [[H2063]] woman [[H802]] and had relations with [[H7126]] her, [[H413]] but I discovered [[H4672]] she was not [[H3808]] a virgin.” [[H1331]] 
15 Then the young woman’s [[H5291]] father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] shall bring [[H3318]] the proof of her [[H5291]] virginity [[H1331]] to [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] elders [[H2205]] at the gate [[H8179]] 
16 [and] [[H5291]] say [[H559]] to [[H413]] the elders, [[H2205]] “I gave [[H5414]] my daughter [[H1323]] in marriage [[H802]] to this [[H2088]] man, [[H376]] but he has come to hate her. [[H8130]] 
17 And now [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] has accused her [[H7760]] of shameful conduct, [[H5949]] saying, [[H559]] ‘I discovered [[H4672]] your daughter [[H1323]] was not [[H3808]] a virgin.’ [[H1331]] But here is the proof [[H428]] of [her] [[H1323]] virginity.” [[H1331]] And they shall spread out [[H6566]] the cloth [[H8071]] before [[H6440]] the city [[H5892]] elders. [[H2205]] 
18 Then the elders [[H2205]] of that [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] shall take [[H3947]] the man [[H376]] and punish him. [[H3256]] 
19 They are also to fine [[H6064]] him [[H853]] a hundred [shekels] [[H3967]] of silver [[H3701]] and give them [[H5414]] to the young woman’s [[H5291]] father, [[H1]] because [[H3588]] this man has given [[H3318]] an Israelite [[H3478]] virgin [[H1330]] a bad [[H7451]] name. [[H8034]] And she shall remain [[H1961]] his wife; [[H802]] he must not [[H3808]] divorce [[H7971]] her as [[H3605]] long as he lives. [[H3117]] 
20 If, however, [[H518]] this [[H2088]] accusation [[H1697]] is [[H1961]] true, [[H571]] and no [[H3808]] proof of the young woman’s [[H5291]] virginity [[H1331]] is found, [[H4672]] 
21 [she] [[H5291]] shall be brought [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of her father’s [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] and there the men [[H376]] of her city [[H5892]] will stone [[H5619]] her to death. [[H4191]] For [[H3588]] she has committed [[H6213]] an outrage [[H5039]] in Israel [[H3478]] by being promiscuous [[H2181]] in her father’s [[H1]] house. [[H1004]] You must purge [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] from among you. [[H7130]] 
22 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] is found [[H4672]] lying [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] another man’s [[H1167]] wife, [[H802]] both the man [[H376]] who slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] [her] [[H802]] and the woman [[H802]] must die. [[H4191]] You must purge [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] from Israel. [[H3478]] 
23 If [[H3588]] there is [[H1961]] a virgin [[H1330]] pledged in marriage [[H781]] to a man, [[H376]] and another man [[H376]] encounters her [[H4672]] in the city [[H5892]] and sleeps [[H7901]] with her, [[H5973]] 
24 you must take both [[H8147]] of them out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] of that [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] and stone [[H5619]] them to death— [[H4191]] the young woman [[H5291]] because [[H5921]] she did not [[H3808]] cry out [[H6817]] in the city, [[H5892]] and the man [[H376]] because [[H5921]] he has violated [[H6031]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife. [[H802]] You must purge [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] from among you. [[H7130]] 
25 But if [[H518]] the man [[H376]] encounters [[H4672]] a betrothed [[H781]] woman [[H5291]] in the open country, [[H7704]] and he [[H376]] overpowers her [[H2388]] and rapes [[H7901]] her, [[H5973]] only [[H905]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] [has done this] [[H7901]] must die. [[H4191]] 
26 Do [[H6213]] nothing [[H3808]] to the young woman, [[H5291]] because [[H3588]] she [[H5291]] [has committed] no [[H369]] sin [[H2399]] [worthy] of death. [[H4194]] This [[H2088]] case [[H1697]] is just like [[H834]] one in which a man [[H376]] attacks [[H6965]] his neighbor [[H7453]] and murders him. [[H7523]] 
27 When [[H3588]] he found [[H4672]] her in the field, [[H7704]] the betrothed [[H781]] woman [[H5291]] cried out, [[H6817]] but there was no [[H369]] one to rescue her. [[H3467]] 
28 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] encounters [[H4672]] a virgin [[H1330]] who [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] pledged in marriage, [[H781]] and he overpowers her [[H8610]] and rapes [[H7901]] her, [[H5973]] and they are discovered, [[H4672]] 
29 the man [[H376]] who raped her [[H7901]] must pay [[H5414]] the young woman’s [[H5291]] father [[H1]] fifty [shekels] [[H2572]] of silver, [[H3701]] and  she must become [[H1961]] his wife [[H802]] because [[H8478]] he has violated her. [[H6031]] He must not [[H3808]] divorce [[H7971]] her as [[H3605]] long as he lives. [[H3117]] 
30 A man [[H376]] is not [[H3808]] to marry [[H3947]] his father’s [[H1]] wife, [[H802]] so that he will not [[H3808]] dishonor [[H1540]] his father’s [[H1]] marriage bed. [[H3671]]
