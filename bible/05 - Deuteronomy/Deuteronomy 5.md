# Deuteronomy 5
[[Deuteronomy 4|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 6|→]]
1 Then Moses [[H4872]] summoned [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Hear, [[H8085]] O Israel, [[H3478]] the statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] declare [[H1696]] in your hearing [[H241]] this day. [[H3117]] Learn [[H3925]] them [[H853]] and observe [[H6213]] them carefully. [[H8104]] 
2 The LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] us at Horeb. [[H2722]] 
3 He [[H3068]] did not [[H3808]] make [[H3772]] this [[H2063]] covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] our fathers, [[H1]] but [[H3588]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] of us who are alive [[H2416]] here today. [[H6311]] 
4 The LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H5973]] you face [[H6440]] to face [[H6440]] out of [[H8432]] the fire [[H784]] on the mountain. [[H2022]] 
5 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I [[H595]] was standing [[H5975]] between [[H996]] the LORD [[H3068]] and you [[H996]] to declare [[H5046]] to you  the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] you were afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] the fire [[H784]] and would not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] the mountain. [[H2022]] And He said: [[H559]] 
6 “I [[H595]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery. [[H5650]] 
7 You shall have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] before [[H5921]] Me. [[H6440]] 
8 You shall not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] for yourself  an idol [[H6459]] in the form [[H8544]] of anything [[H3605]] in the heavens [[H8064]] above [[H4605]] or on the earth [[H776]] beneath [[H8478]] or in the waters [[H4325]] below. [[H8478]] 
9 You shall not [[H3808]] bow down [[H7812]] to them  or worship them; [[H5647]] for [[H3588]] I, [[H595]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] am a jealous [[H7067]] God, [[H410]] visiting [[H6485]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the fathers [[H1]] on [[H5921]] their children, [[H1121]] to the third [[H8029]] and fourth [generations] [[H7256]] of those who hate Me, [[H8130]] 
10 but showing [[H6213]] loving devotion [[H2617]] to a thousand [generations] [[H505]] of those who love Me [[H157]] and keep [[H8104]] My commandments. [[H4687]] 
11 You shall not [[H3808]] take [[H5375]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in vain, [[H7723]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] leave anyone unpunished [[H5352]] who [[H834]] takes [[H5375]] His name [[H8034]] in vain. [[H7723]] 
12 Remember [[H8104]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] day [[H3117]] by keeping it holy, [[H6942]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has commanded you. [[H6680]] 
13 Six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] you shall labor [[H5647]] and do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] your work, [[H4399]] 
14 but the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] is a Sabbath [[H7676]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] on which you must not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] work— [[H4399]] neither you, [[H859]] nor your son [[H1121]] [or] daughter, [[H1323]] nor your manservant [[H5650]] [or] maidservant, [[H519]] nor your ox [[H7794]] or donkey [[H2543]] or any [[H3605]] of your livestock, [[H929]] nor the foreigner [[H1616]] within your gates, [[H8179]] so that [[H4616]] your manservant [[H5650]] and maidservant [[H519]] may rest [[H5117]] as you do. [[H3644]] 
15 Remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] you were [[H1961]] a slave [[H5650]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and that the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] brought you out [[H3318]] of there [[H8033]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] and outstretched [[H5186]] arm. [[H2220]] That is why [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has commanded [[H6680]] you to keep [[H6213]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]] 
16 Honor [[H3513]] your father [[H1]] and your mother, [[H517]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has commanded you, [[H6680]] so that [[H4616]] your days [[H3117]] may be long [[H748]] and that [[H4616]] it may go well [[H3190]] with you  in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you.  
17 You shall not [[HThou shalt not kill.]] murder. [[H3808]] [[H7523]] 
18 You shall not [[HNeither shalt thou commit adultery.]] commit adultery. [[H3808]] [[H5003]] 
19 You shall not [[HNeither shalt thou steal.]] steal. [[H3808]] [[H1589]] 
20 You shall not [[H3808]] bear [[H6030]] FALSE [[H7723]] witness [[H5707]] against your neighbor. [[H7453]] 
21 You shall not [[H3808]] covet [[H2530]] your neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife. [[H802]] You shall not covet [[H183]] your neighbor’s [[H7453]] house [[H1004]] or field, [[H7704]] or his manservant [[H5650]] or maidservant, [[H519]] or his ox [[H7794]] or donkey, [[H2543]] or anything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] belongs to your neighbor.” [[H7453]] 
22 The LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] these [[H428]] commandments [[H1697]] in a loud [[H1419]] voice [[H6963]] to [[H413]] your whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] out of [[H8432]] the fire, [[H784]] the cloud, [[H6051]] and the deep darkness [[H6205]] on the mountain; [[H2022]] He added [[H3254]] nothing more. [[H3808]] And He wrote them [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] tablets [[H3871]] of stone [[H68]] and gave [[H5414]] them to me. [[H413]] 
23 And when you heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] out of [[H8432]] the darkness, [[H2822]] while the mountain [[H2022]] was blazing [[H1197]] with fire, [[H784]] all [[H3605]] the heads [[H7218]] of your tribes [[H7626]] and your elders [[H2205]] approached [[H7126]] me, [[H413]] 
24 and you said, [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] has shown [[H7200]] us His glory [[H3519]] and greatness, [[H1433]] and we have heard [[H8085]] His voice [[H6963]] out of [[H8432]] the fire. [[H784]] Today [[H3117]] we have seen [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] God [[H430]] can speak [[H1696]] with [[H854]] a man, [[H120]] yet [the man] lives. [[H2425]] 
25 But now, [[H6258]] why [[H4100]] should we die? [[H4191]] For [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] fire [[H784]] will consume us, [[H398]] and we will die, [[H4191]] if [[H518]] we [[H587]] hear [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] any longer. [[H3254]] 
26 For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] of all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] has heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the living [[H2416]] God [[H430]] speaking [[H1696]] out of [[H8432]] the fire, [[H784]] as we [have], [[H3644]] and survived? [[H2421]] 
27 Go near [[H7126]] and listen [[H8085]] to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] says. [[H559]] Then you [[H859]] can tell [[H1696]] us everything [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] tells you; [[H1696]] we will listen [[H8085]] and obey.” [[H6213]] 
28 And the LORD [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] you spoke [[H1696]] to me, [[H413]] and [He] [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “I have heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] have spoken [[H1696]] to you. [[H413]] They have done well [[H3190]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they have spoken. [[H1696]] 
29 If only [[H4310]] they had [[H1961]] such [[H2088]] a heart [[H3824]] to fear [[H3372]] Me [[H853]] and keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] My commandments [[H4687]] always, [[H3605]] so that [[H4616]] it might be well [[H3190]] with them  and their children [[H1121]] forever. [[H5769]] 
30 Go [[H1980]] and tell them: [[H559]] ‘Return [[H7725]] to your tents.’ [[H168]] 
31 But you [[H859]] stand [[H5975]] here [[H6311]] with Me, [[H5978]] that I may speak [[H1696]] to you [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] you are to teach them [[H3925]] to follow [[H6213]] in the land [[H776]] I [[H595]] am giving [[H5414]] them  to possess.” [[H3423]] 
32 So be careful [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has commanded you; [[H6680]] you are not [[H3808]] to turn aside [[H5493]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left. [[H8040]] 
33 You must walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has commanded you, [[H6680]] so that [[H4616]] you may live [[H2421]] and prosper [[H2895]] and prolong [[H748]] [your] days [[H3117]] in the land [[H776]] you will possess. [[H3423]]
