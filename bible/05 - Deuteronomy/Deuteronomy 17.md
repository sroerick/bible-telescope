# Deuteronomy 17
[[Deuteronomy 16|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 18|→]]
1 You shall not [[H3808]] sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] an ox [[H7794]] or a sheep [[H7716]] with any defect [[H3971]] [or] [[H3605]] serious [[H7451]] flaw, [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
2 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] or [[H176]] woman [[H802]] among you [[H7130]] in one [[H259]] of the towns [[H8179]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] gives [[H5414]] you  is found [[H4672]] doing [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] by transgressing [[H5674]] His covenant [[H1285]] 
3 and going [[H1980]] to worship [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] bowing down [[H7812]] to them  or to the sun [[H8121]] or [[H176]] moon [[H3394]] or [[H176]] any [[H3605]] of the host [[H6635]] of heaven— [[H8064]] which [[H834]] I have forbidden— [[H3808]] 
4 and if it is reported [[H5046]] and you hear about it, [[H8085]] you must investigate it [[H1875]] thoroughly. [[H3190]] If [[H2009]] the report [[H1697]] is [[H6213]] TRUE [[H571]] and such [[H2063]] an abomination [[H8441]] has happened in Israel, [[H3478]] 
5 you must bring out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] your gates [[H8179]] that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] or [[H176]] woman [[H802]] who [[H834]] has done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] thing, [[H1697]] and stone that person [[H5619]] to death. [[H4191]] 
6 On [[H5921]] the testimony [[H6310]] of two [[H8147]] or [[H176]] three [[H7969]] witnesses [[H5707]] a man shall be put to death, [[H4191]] but he shall not [[H3808]] be executed [[H4191]] on [[H5921]] the testimony [[H6310]] of a lone [[H259]] witness. [[H5707]] 
7 The hands [[H3027]] of the witnesses [[H5707]] shall be [[H1961]] the first [[H7223]] in putting him to death, [[H4191]] and after that, [[H314]] the hands [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]] You must purge [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] from among you. [[H7130]] 
8 If [[H3588]] a case [[H1697]] is too difficult [[H6381]] for you [[H4480]] to judge, [[H4941]] whether [[H1697]] the controversy [[H7379]] within your gates [[H8179]] is regarding [[H996]] bloodshed, [[H1818]] lawsuits, [[H1779]] or assaults, [[H5061]] you must go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will choose. [[H977]] 
9 You are to go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the Levitical [[H3881]] priests [[H3548]] and to [[H413]] the judge [[H8199]] who [[H834]] presides at that [[H1992]] time. [[H3117]] Inquire of them, [[H1875]] and they will give [[H5046]] you a verdict [[H1697]] in the case. [[H4941]] 
10 You must abide by [[H6213]] the verdict [[H1697]] they give [[H5046]] you at [[H4480]] the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] will choose. [[H977]] Be careful [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] they instruct you, [[H3384]] 
11 according [[H5921]] to the terms [[H6310]] of law [[H8451]] they give [[H3384]] and the verdict [[H4941]] they proclaim. [[H559]] Do not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left [[H8040]] from [[H4480]] the decision [[H1697]] they declare [[H5046]] to you.  
12 But the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] acts [[H6213]] presumptuously, [[H2087]] refusing [[H1115]] to listen [[H8085]] either to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] who stands [[H5975]] there [[H8033]] to serve [[H8334]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God, [[H430]] or [[H176]] to [[H413]] the judge, [[H8199]] must be put to death. [[H4191]] You must purge [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] from Israel. [[H3478]] 
13 Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] will hear [[H8085]] and be afraid, [[H3372]] and will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] behave arrogantly. [[H2102]] 
14 When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you  and have taken possession of it [[H3423]] and settled it, [[H3427]] and you say, [[H559]] “Let us set [[H7760]] a king [[H4428]] over us [[H5921]] like all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] around us,” [[H5439]] 
15 you are to appoint [[H7760]] over yourselves [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] shall choose. [[H977]] Appoint [[H7760]] a king [[H4428]] from among [[H7130]] your brothers; [[H251]] you are not [[H3808]] to set [[H5414]] a foreigner [[H376]] over yourselves, [[H5921]] or one [[H1931]] who [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] of your brothers. [[H251]] 
16 But [[H7535]] [the king] must not [[H3808]] acquire many [[H7235]] horses [[H5483]] for himself  or send the people [[H5971]] back [[H7725]] to Egypt [[H4714]] to [[H4616]] acquire more [[H7235]] horses, [[H5483]] for the LORD [[H3068]] has told you, [[H559]] ‘You are never [[H3808]] to go back [[H7725]] that [[H2088]] way [[H1870]] again.’ [[H5750]] 
17 He must not [[H3808]] take many [[H7235]] wives [[H802]] for himself,  lest [[H3808]] his heart [[H3824]] go astray. [[H5493]] He must not [[H3808]] accumulate [[H7235]] for himself  great amounts [[H3966]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold. [[H2091]] 
18 When he is seated [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his royal [[H4467]] throne, [[H3678]] he must write [[H3789]] for himself [[H853]] a copy [[H4932]] of this [[H2063]] instruction [[H8451]] on [[H5921]] a scroll [[H5612]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the Levitical [[H3881]] priests. [[H3548]] 
19 It is to remain [[H1961]] with him, [[H5973]] and he is to read [[H7121]] from it  all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life, [[H2416]] so that [[H4616]] he may learn [[H3925]] to fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] by carefully observing [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] instruction [[H8451]] and these [[H428]] statutes. [[H2706]] 
20 Then his heart [[H3824]] will not [[H1115]] be exalted [[H7311]] above [[H4480]] his countrymen, [[H251]] and he will not [[H1115]] turn aside [[H5493]] from the commandment, [[H4687]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left, [[H8040]] in order that [[H4616]] he [[H1931]] and his sons [[H1121]] may reign [[H748]] many years [[H3117]] over [[H5921]] his kingdom [[H4467]] in [[H7130]] Israel.
