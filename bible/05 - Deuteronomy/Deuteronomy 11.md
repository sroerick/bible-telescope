# Deuteronomy 11
[[Deuteronomy 10|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 12|→]]
1 You shall therefore love [[H157]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and always [[H3605]] keep [[H8104]] His charge, [[H4931]] His statutes, [[H2708]] His ordinances, [[H4941]] and His commandments. [[H4687]] 
2 Know [[H3045]] this day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] it is not [[H3808]] your children [[H1121]] who [[H834]] have known [[H3045]] and [[H834]] seen [[H7200]] the discipline [[H4148]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]] His greatness, [[H1433]] His mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and His outstretched [[H5186]] arm; [[H2220]] 
3 the signs [[H226]] and works [[H4639]] He did [[H6213]] in [[H8432]] Egypt [[H4714]] to Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and all [[H3605]] his land; [[H776]] 
4 what [[H834]] He did [[H6213]] to the Egyptian [[H4714]] army [[H2428]] and horses [[H5483]] and chariots [[H7393]] when [[H834]] He made the waters [[H4325]] of the Red [[H5488]] Sea [[H3220]] engulf [[H6687]] them [[H6440]] as they pursued you, [[H7291]] and [how] He [[H3068]] destroyed them completely, [[H6]] even to [[H5704]] this day; [[H3117]] 
5 what [[H834]] He did [[H6213]] for you  in the wilderness [[H4057]] until [[H5704]] you reached [[H935]] this [[H2088]] place; [[H4725]] 
6 and what [[H834]] He did [[H6213]] in the midst [[H7130]] of all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] to Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram, [[H48]] the sons [[H1121]] of Eliab [[H446]] the Reubenite, [[H1121]] when [[H834]] the earth [[H776]] opened [[H6475]] its mouth [[H6310]] and swallowed them, [[H1104]] their households, [[H1004]] their tents, [[H168]] and every [[H3605]] living thing [[H3351]] that belonged to them. [[H7272]] 
7 For [it is] [[H3588]] your own eyes [[H5869]] [that] have seen [[H7200]] every [[H3605]] great [[H1419]] work [[H4639]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has done. [[H6213]] 
8 You shall therefore keep [[H8104]] every [[H3605]] commandment [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving you today, [[H6680]] so that [[H4616]] you may have the strength [[H2388]] to go in [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are to inherit, [[H3423]] 
9 and so that [[H4616]] you may live long [[H748]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] swore [[H7650]] to your fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] them  and their descendants, [[H2233]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]] 
10 For [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] is not [[H3808]] like the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from which [[H1931]] you have come, [[H3318]] where [[H834]] you sowed [[H2232]] your seed [[H2233]] and irrigated [[H8248]] on foot, [[H7272]] like a vegetable [[H3419]] garden. [[H1588]] 
11 But the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] is a land [[H776]] of mountains [[H2022]] and valleys [[H1237]] that drinks in [[H8354]] the rain [[H4306]] from heaven. [[H8064]] 
12 It is a land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] cares for; [[H1875]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] are always on it, [[H8548]] from the beginning [[H7225]] to [[H5704]] the end [[H319]] of the year. [[H8141]] 
13 So [[H1961]] if [[H518]] you carefully obey [[H8085]] the commandments [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving you today, [[H6680]] to love [[H157]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and to serve [[H5647]] Him with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and all [[H3605]] your soul, [[H5315]] 
14 then I will provide [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] for your land [[H776]] in season, [[H6256]] the autumn and spring rains, [[H3138]] that you may gather [[H622]] your grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and oil. [[H3323]] 
15 And I will provide [[H5414]] grass [[H6212]] in the fields [[H7704]] for your livestock, [[H929]] and you will eat [[H398]] and be satisfied. [[H7646]] 
16 But be careful [[H8104]] that you are not [[H6435]] enticed [[H6601]] to turn aside [[H5493]] to worship [[H5647]] and bow down [[H7812]] to other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] 
17 or the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be kindled [[H2734]] against you.  He will shut [[H6113]] the heavens [[H8064]] so that there will be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain, [[H4306]] nor will [[H3808]] the land [[H127]] yield [[H5414]] its produce, [[H2981]] and you will soon perish [[H6]] from [[H5921]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] is giving [[H5414]] you.  
18 Fix [[H7760]] these [[H428]] words of mine [[H1697]] in your hearts [[H3824]] and minds, [[H5315]] tie [[H7194]] them [[H853]] as a sign [[H226]] on [[H5921]] your hands [[H3027]] and bind them [[H1961]] on your foreheads. [[H996]] 
19 Teach [[H3925]] them [[H853]] to your children, [[H1121]] speaking [[H1696]] about them  when you sit [[H3427]] at home [[H1004]] and when you walk [[H1980]] along the road, [[H1870]] when you lie down [[H7901]] and when you get up. [[H6965]] 
20 Write [[H3789]] them on [[H5921]] the doorposts [[H4201]] of your houses [[H1004]] and gates, [[H8179]] 
21 so that [[H4616]] as long as [[H3117]] the heavens [[H8064]] are above [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] your days [[H3117]] [and those] [[H3117]] of your children [[H1121]] may be multiplied [[H7235]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] swore [[H7650]] to give [[H5414]] your fathers. [[H1]] 
22 For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you carefully observe [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2063]] commandments [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving [[H6680]] you to follow— [[H6213]] to love [[H157]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] His ways, [[H1870]] and to hold fast to Him— [[H1692]] 
23 then the LORD [[H3068]] will drive out [[H3423]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] before [[H4480]] you, [[H6440]] and you will dispossess [[H3423]] nations [[H1471]] greater [[H1419]] and stronger [than you]. [[H6099]] 
24 Every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the sole [[H3709]] of your foot [[H7272]] treads [[H1869]] will be yours. [[H1961]] Your territory [[H1366]] will extend [[H1961]] from [[H4480]] the wilderness [[H4057]] to Lebanon, [[H3844]] and from [[H4480]] the Euphrates [[H6578]] River [[H5104]] to [[H5704]] the Western Sea. [[H3220]] 
25 No [[H3808]] man [[H376]] will be able to stand [[H3320]] against you; [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will put [[H5414]] fear [[H6343]] and dread [[H4172]] of you [[H5921]] upon [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the land, [[H776]] wherever [[H834]] you set foot, [[H1869]] as [[H834]] He has promised you. [[H1696]] 
26 See, [[H7200]] today [[H3117]] I [[H595]] am setting [[H5414]] before you [[H6440]] a blessing [[H1293]] and a curse: [[H7045]] 
27 There will be blessing [[H1293]] if [[H834]] you obey [[H8085]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] am giving you today, [[H6680]] 
28 but a curse [[H7045]] if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and turn aside [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] the path [[H1870]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you today [[H3117]] by following [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] which you have not [[H3808]] known. [[H3045]] 
29 When [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] brings [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to possess, [[H3423]] you are to proclaim [[H5414]] the blessing [[H1293]] on [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Gerizim [[H1630]] and the curse [[H7045]] on [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Ebal. [[H5858]] 
30 Are not [[H3808]] these mountains [[H1992]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] west [[H3996]] of the road [[H1870]] toward [[H310]] the sunset, [[H8121]] in the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites [[H3669]] who live [[H3427]] in the Arabah [[H6160]] opposite [[H4136]] Gilgal, [[H1537]] near [[H681]] the oak [[H436]] of Moreh? [[H4176]] 
31 For [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are about to cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to enter [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you. [[H5414]] When you possess [[H3423]] and settle it, [[H3427]] 
32 be careful [[H8104]] to follow [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] am setting [[H5414]] before you [[H6440]] today. [[H3117]]
