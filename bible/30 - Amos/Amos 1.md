# Amos 1
[[Joel 3|←]] • [[Amos 2|→]]
1 [These are] the words [[H1697]] of Amos, [[H5986]] who [[H834]] was [[H1961]] among the sheepherders [[H5349]] of Tekoa— [[H8620]] what [[H834]] he saw [[H2372]] concerning [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] two years [[H8141]] before [[H6440]] the earthquake, [[H7494]] in the days [[H3117]] [when] Uzziah [[H5818]] [was] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoash [[H3101]] [was] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
2 He said: [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] roars [[H7580]] from Zion [[H6726]] and raises [[H5414]] His voice [[H6963]] from Jerusalem; [[H3389]] the pastures [[H4999]] of the shepherds [[H7462]] mourn, [[H56]] and the summit [[H7218]] of Carmel [[H3760]] withers.” [[H3001]] 
3 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] even [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] revoke [My judgment], [[H7725]] because [[H5921]] they threshed [[H1758]] Gilead [[H1568]] with sledges [[H2742]] of iron. [[H1270]] 
4 So I will send [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] upon the house [[H1004]] of Hazael [[H2371]] to consume [[H398]] the citadels [[H759]] of  Ben-hadad. [[H1130]] 
5 I will break down [[H7665]] the gates [[H1280]] of Damascus [[H1834]] and cut off [[H3772]] the ruler [[H3427]] of the Valley of Aven [[H1237]] and him who wields [[H8551]] the scepter [[H7626]] from [[H1004]] Beth-eden. [[H5730]] The people [[H5971]] of Aram [[H758]] will be exiled [[H1540]] to Kir,” [[H7024]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
6 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Gaza, [[H5804]] even [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] revoke [My judgment], [[H7725]] because [[H5921]] they exiled [[H1540]] a whole [[H8003]] population [[H1546]] to deliver [them] up [[H5462]] to Edom. [[H123]] 
7 So I will send [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] upon the walls [[H2346]] of Gaza, [[H5804]] to consume [[H398]] its citadels. [[H759]] 
8 I will cut off [[H3772]] the ruler [[H3427]] from Ashdod [[H795]] and him who wields [[H8551]] the scepter [[H7626]] from Ashkelon. [[H831]] And I will turn [[H7725]] My hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] Ekron, [[H6138]] and the remnant [[H7611]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] will perish,” [[H6]] says [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]] 
9 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Tyre, [[H6865]] even [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] revoke [My judgment], [[H7725]] because [[H5921]] they delivered up [[H5462]] a whole [[H8003]] congregation of exiles [[H1546]] to Edom [[H123]] and broke [[H3808]] a covenant [[H1285]] of brotherhood. [[H251]] 
10 So I will send [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] upon the walls [[H2346]] of Tyre, [[H6865]] to consume [[H398]] its citadels.” [[H759]] 
11 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Edom, [[H123]] even [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] revoke [My judgment], [[H7725]] because [[H5921]] he pursued [[H7291]] his brother [[H251]] with the sword [[H2719]] and stifled [[H7843]] all compassion; [[H7356]] his anger [[H639]] raged [[H2963]] continually, [[H5703]] and his fury [[H5678]] flamed [[H8104]] incessantly. [[H5331]] 
12 So I will send [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] upon Teman [[H8487]] to consume [[H398]] the citadels [[H759]] of Bozrah.” [[H1224]] 
13 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] even [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] revoke [My judgment], [[H7725]] because [[H5921]] they ripped open [[H1234]] the pregnant [[H2030]] women of Gilead [[H1568]] in order to [[H4616]] enlarge [[H7337]] their territory. [[H1366]] 
14 So I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in the walls [[H2346]] of Rabbah [[H7237]] to consume [[H398]] its citadels [[H759]] amid war cries [[H8643]] on the day [[H3117]] of battle [[H4421]] and a violent wind [[H5591]] on the day [[H3117]] of tempest. [[H5492]] 
15 Their king [[H4428]] will go [[H1980]] into exile— [[H1473]] he [[H1931]] and his princes [[H8269]] together,” [[H3162]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
