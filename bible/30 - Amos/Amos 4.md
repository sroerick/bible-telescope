# Amos 4
[[Amos 3|←]] • [[Amos 5|→]]
1 Hear [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] you cows [[H6510]] of Bashan [[H1316]] on Mount [[H2022]] Samaria, [[H8111]] you women who oppress [[H6231]] the poor [[H1800]] and crush [[H7533]] the needy, [[H34]] who say [[H559]] to your husbands, [[H113]] “Bring us [[H935]] more to drink.” [[H8354]] 
2 The Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] has sworn [[H7650]] by His holiness: [[H6944]] “Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming [[H935]] when you will be taken away [[H5375]] with hooks, [[H6793]] and your posterity [[H319]] with [[H5518]] fishhooks. [[H1729]] 
3 You will go out [[H3318]] [through] broken [walls], [[H6556]] each one [[H802]] straight ahead of her, [[H5048]] and you will be cast out [[H7993]] toward Harmon,” [[H2038]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 “Go [[H935]] to Bethel [[H1008]] and transgress; [[H6586]] rebel [[H6586]] even more [[H7235]] at Gilgal! [[H1537]] Bring [[H935]] your sacrifices [[H2077]] every morning, [[H1242]] your tithes [[H4643]] every three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]] 
5 Offer [[H6999]] leavened bread [[H2557]] as a thank offering, [[H8426]] and loudly [[H7121]] proclaim [[H8085]] your freewill offerings, [[H5071]] for [[H3588]] that is what [[H3651]] [you] children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] love to do!” [[H157]] declares [[H136]] the LORD [[H5002]] GOD. [[H3068]] 
6 “I [[H589]] beset [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] your cities [[H5892]] with cleanness [[H5356]] of teeth [[H8127]] and all [[H3605]] your towns [[H4725]] with lack [[H2640]] of bread, [[H3899]] yet you did not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to Me.” [[H5704]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 “I [[H595]] also [[H1571]] withheld [[H4513]] the rain [[H1653]] from you [[H4480]] when the harvest was [[H7105]] three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] away. [[H5750]] I sent rain [[H4305]] on [[H5921]] one [[H259]] city [[H5892]] but withheld [[H3808]] [it] [[H4305]] from [[H5921]] another. [[H259]] One [[H259]] field [[H2513]] received rain [[H4305]] while [one] [[H2513]] without [[H3808]] rain [[H4305]] withered. [[H3001]] 
8 People staggered [[H5128]] from city [[H5892]] to [[H413]] city [[H5892]] for water [[H4325]] to drink, [[H8354]] but they were not [[H3808]] satisfied; [[H7646]] yet you have not [[H3808]] returned [[H7725]] to Me,” [[H5704]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
9 “I struck [[H5221]] you with blight [[H7711]] and mildew [[H3420]] in your growing [[H7235]] gardens [[H1593]] and vineyards; [[H3754]] the locust [[H1501]] devoured [[H398]] your fig [[H8384]] and olive trees, [[H2132]] yet you did not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to Me,” [[H5704]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
10 “I sent [[H7971]] plagues [[H1698]] among you  like those [[H1870]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] I killed [[H2026]] your young men [[H970]] with the sword, [[H2719]] along with [[H5973]] your captured [[H7628]] horses. [[H5483]] I filled [[H5927]] your nostrils [[H639]] with the stench [[H889]] of your camp, [[H4264]] yet you did not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to Me,” [[H5704]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 “Some of you I overthrew [[H2015]] as I overthrew [[H4114]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah, [[H6017]] and you were [[H1961]] like a firebrand [[H181]] snatched [[H5337]] from a blaze, [[H8316]] yet you did not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to Me,” [[H5704]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 “Therefore, [[H3651]] that is what [[H3541]] I will do [[H6213]] to you,  O Israel, [[H3478]] and since [[H6118]] I will do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] to you,  prepare [[H3559]] to meet [[H7125]] your God, [[H430]] O Israel! [[H3478]] 
13 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] He who forms [[H3335]] the mountains, [[H2022]] who creates [[H1254]] the wind, [[H7307]] and reveals [[H5046]] His thoughts [[H7808]] to man, [[H120]] the One who turns [[H6213]] the dawn [[H7837]] to darkness [[H5890]] and strides [[H1869]] on [[H5921]] the heights [[H1116]] of the earth, [[H776]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] is His name.” [[H8034]]
