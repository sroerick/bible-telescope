# Amos 9
[[Amos 8|←]] • [[Obadiah 1|→]]
1 I saw [[H7200]] the Lord [[H136]] standing [[H5324]] beside [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] and He said: [[H559]] “Strike [[H5221]] the tops of the pillars [[H3730]] so that the thresholds [[H5592]] shake. [[H7493]] Topple them [[H1214]] on the heads [[H7218]] of all the people, [[H3605]] and I will kill [[H2026]] the rest [[H319]] with the sword. [[H2719]] None [[H3808]] of those who flee [[H5127]] will get away; [[H5127]] none [[H3808]] of the fugitives [[H6412]] will escape. [[H4422]] 
2 Though [[H518]] they dig down [[H2864]] to Sheol, [[H7585]] from there [[H8033]] My hand [[H3027]] will take them; [[H3947]] and though [[H518]] they climb up [[H5927]] to heaven, [[H8064]] from there [[H8033]] I will pull them down. [[H3381]] 
3 Though [[H518]] they hide themselves [[H2244]] atop [[H7218]] Carmel, [[H3760]] there [[H8033]] I will track them [[H2664]] and seize them; [[H3947]] and though [[H518]] they hide [[H5641]] from [[H5048]] Me [[H5869]] at the bottom of [[H7172]] the sea, [[H3220]] there [[H8033]] I will command [[H6680]] the serpent [[H5175]] to bite them. [[H5391]] 
4 Though [[H518]] they are driven [[H1980]] by [[H6440]] their enemies [[H341]] into captivity, [[H7628]] there [[H8033]] I will command [[H6680]] the sword [[H2719]] to slay them. [[H2026]] I will fix [[H7760]] My eyes [[H5869]] upon them [[H5921]] for harm [[H7451]] and not [[H3808]] for good.” [[H2896]] 
5 The Lord, [[H136]] the GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] He who touches [[H5060]] the earth [[H776]] and melts it, [[H4127]] and all [[H3605]] its dwellers [[H3427]] mourn— [[H56]] all [the land] [[H3605]] rises [[H5927]] like the Nile, [[H2975]] then sinks [[H8257]] like the river [[H2975]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] 
6 He builds [[H1129]] His upper rooms [[H4609]] in the heavens [[H8064]] and founds [[H3245]] His vault [[H92]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]] He summons [[H7121]] the waters [[H4325]] of the sea [[H3220]] and pours them [[H8210]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H776]] The LORD [[H3068]] is His name. [[H8034]] 
7 “Are you not [[H3808]] like the Cushites [[H3569]] to Me,  O children [[H1121]] of Israel?” [[H3478]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Did I not [[H3808]] bring [[H5927]] Israel [[H3478]] up from the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the Philistines [[H6430]] from Caphtor, [[H3731]] and the Arameans [[H758]] from Kir? [[H7024]] 
8 Surely [[H2009]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] are on the sinful [[H2400]] kingdom, [[H4467]] and I will destroy [[H8045]] it [[H853]] from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]] Yet [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] utterly [[H8045]] destroy [[H8045]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob,” [[H3290]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
9 “For [[H3588]] surely [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will give the command, [[H6680]] and I will shake [[H5128]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] among all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H1471]] as [[H834]] [grain] is sifted [[H5128]] in a sieve, [[H3531]] but not [[H3808]] a pebble [[H6872]] will reach [[H5307]] the ground. [[H776]] 
10 All [[H3605]] the sinners [[H2400]] among My people [[H5971]] will die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] all those who say, [[H559]] ‘Disaster [[H7451]] will never [[H3808]] draw near [[H5066]] or confront [[H6923]] us.’ [[H5704]] 
11 “In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will restore [[H6965]] the fallen [[H5307]] tent [[H5521]] of David. [[H1732]] I will repair [[H1443]] its gaps, [[H6556]] restore [[H6965]] its ruins, [[H2034]] and rebuild [[H1129]] it as in the days [[H3117]] of old, [[H5769]] 
12 so that [[H4616]] they may possess [[H3423]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Edom [[H123]] and all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] bear [[H7121]] My name,” [[H8034]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who will do [[H6213]] this. [[H2063]] 
13 “Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when the plowman [[H2790]] will overtake [[H5066]] the reaper [[H7114]] and the treader [[H1869]] of grapes, [[H6025]] the sower [[H4900]] of seed. [[H2233]] The mountains [[H2022]] will drip [[H5197]] with sweet wine, [[H6071]] with which all [[H3605]] the hills [[H1389]] will flow. [[H4127]] 
14 I will restore [[H7725]] from captivity [[H7622]] My people [[H5971]] Israel; [[H3478]] they will rebuild [[H1129]] and inhabit [[H3427]] the ruined [[H8074]] cities; [[H5892]] they will plant [[H5193]] vineyards [[H3754]] and drink [[H8354]] their wine; [[H3196]] they will make [[H6213]] gardens [[H1593]] and eat [[H398]] their fruit. [[H6529]] 
15 I will firmly plant them [[H5193]] on [[H5921]] their own land, [[H127]] and they will never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] be uprooted [[H5428]] from [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] I have given [[H5414]] them,” [[H1992]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God. [[H430]]
