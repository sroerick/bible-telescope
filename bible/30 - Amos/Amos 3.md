# Amos 3
[[Amos 2|←]] • [[Amos 4|→]]
1 Hear [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken [[H1696]] against you, [[H5921]] O children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] against [[H5921]] the entire [[H3605]] clan [[H4940]] that [[H834]] I brought up [[H5927]] out [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] 
2 “You [[H853]] only [[H7535]] have I known [[H3045]] from all [[H3605]] the clans [[H4940]] of the earth; [[H127]] therefore [[H5921]] I will punish [[H6485]] you for all [[H3605]] your iniquities. [[H5771]] 
3 Can two [[H8147]] walk [[H1980]] together [[H3162]] without [[H1115]] an appointment to meet? [[H3259]] 
4 Does a lion [[H738]] roar [[H7580]] in the forest [[H3293]] when he has no [[H369]] prey? [[H2964]] Does a young lion [[H3715]] growl [[H5414]] in his den [[H4585]] if [[H518]] he has caught [[H3920]] nothing? [[H1115]] 
5 Does a bird [[H6833]] land [[H5307]] in [[H5921]] a snare [[H6341]] where no [[H369]] bait [has been set]? [[H4170]] Does a trap [[H6341]] spring [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the ground [[H127]] when it has [[H3920]] nothing [[H3808]] to catch? [[H3920]] 
6 If [[H518]] a trumpet [[H7782]] sounds [[H8628]] in a city, [[H5892]] will the people [[H5971]] not [[H3808]] tremble? [[H2729]] If [[H518]] calamity [[H7451]] comes [[H1961]] to a city, [[H5892]] has not [[H3808]] the LORD [[H3068]] caused it? [[H6213]] 
7 Surely [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] does [[H6213]] nothing [[H3808]] without [[H3588]] revealing [[H1540]] His plan [[H5475]] to [[H413]] His servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]] 
8 The lion [[H738]] has roared— [[H7580]] who [[H4310]] will not [[H3808]] fear? [[H3372]] The Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] has spoken— [[H1696]] who [[H4310]] will not [[H3808]] prophesy? [[H5012]] 
9 Proclaim [[H8085]] to [[H5921]] the citadels [[H759]] of Ashdod [[H795]] as well as [[H5921]] the citadels [[H759]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] ‘Assemble [[H622]] on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Samaria; [[H8111]] see [[H7200]] the great [[H7227]] unrest [[H4103]] in the city [[H8432]] and the acts of oppression [[H6217]] in her midst. [[H7130]] 
10 For they know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] how to do [[H6213]] right— [[H5229]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD— [[H3068]] those who store up [[H686]] violence [[H2555]] and destruction [[H7701]] in their citadels.’” [[H759]] 
11 Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “An enemy [[H6862]] will surround [[H5439]] the land; [[H776]] he will pull down [[H3381]] your strongholds [[H5797]] and plunder [[H962]] your citadels.” [[H759]] 
12 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “As [[H834]] the shepherd [[H7462]] snatches [[H5337]] from the mouth [[H6310]] of the lion [[H738]] two [[H8147]] legs [[H3767]] or [[H176]] a piece [[H915]] of an ear, [[H241]] so [[H3651]] the Israelites [[H1121]] dwelling [[H3427]] in Samaria [[H8111]] will be snatched away [[H5337]] with the corner [[H6285]] of a bed [[H4296]] or the cushion [[H1833]] of a couch. [[H6210]] 
13 Hear [[H8085]] and testify [[H5749]] against the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
14 On the day [[H3117]] I punish [[H6485]] Israel [[H3478]] for their transgressions, [[H6588]] I will visit [destruction] [[H6485]] on [[H5921]] the altars [[H4196]] of  Bethel; [[H1008]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar [[H4196]] will be cut off, [[H1438]] and they will fall [[H5307]] to the ground. [[H776]] 
15 I will tear down [[H5221]] the winter [[H2779]] house [[H1004]] along with [[H5921]] the summer [[H7019]] house; [[H1004]] the houses [[H1004]] of ivory [[H8127]] will also perish, [[H6]] and the mansions [[H7227]] will come to an end,” [[H5486]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
