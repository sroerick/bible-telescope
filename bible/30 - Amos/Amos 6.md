# Amos 6
[[Amos 5|←]] • [[Amos 7|→]]
1 Woe [[H1945]] to those at ease [[H7600]] in Zion [[H6726]] and those secure [[H982]] on Mount [[H2022]] Samaria, [[H8111]] the distinguished ones [[H5344]] of the foremost [[H7225]] nation, [[H1471]] to whom [[H1992]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] comes. [[H935]] 
2 Cross over [[H5674]] to Calneh [[H3641]] and see; [[H7200]] go [[H1980]] from [[H4480]] there [[H8033]] to great [[H7227]] Hamath; [[H2574]] then go down [[H3381]] to Gath [[H1661]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] Are you better than [[H2896]] these [[H428]] kingdoms? [[H4467]] Is their territory [[H1366]] larger [[H7227]] than yours? [[H1366]] 
3 You dismiss [[H5077]] the day [[H3117]] of calamity [[H7451]] and bring near [[H5066]] a reign [[H7675]] of violence. [[H2555]] 
4 You lie [[H7901]] on [[H5921]] beds [[H4296]] inlaid with ivory, [[H8127]] and lounge [[H5628]] upon [[H5921]] your couches; [[H6210]] You dine on [[H398]] lambs [[H3733]] from the flock [[H6629]] and calves [[H5695]] from [[H8432]] the stall. [[H4770]] 
5 You improvise [[H6527]] songs [[H5921]] on the harp [[H5035]] like David [[H1732]] and invent [[H2803]] your own [[H1992]] musical [[H7892]] instruments. [[H3627]] 
6 You drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] by the bowlful [[H4219]] and anoint yourselves [[H4886]] with the finest [[H7225]] oils, [[H8081]] but you fail to [[H3808]] grieve [[H2470]] over [[H5921]] the ruin [[H7667]] of Joseph. [[H3130]] 
7 Therefore, [[H3651]] you will now [[H6258]] go into exile [[H1540]] as the first [[H7218]] of the captives, [[H1540]] and your feasting [[H4797]] and lounging [[H5628]] will come to an end. [[H5493]] 
8 The Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] has sworn [[H7650]] by Himself— [[H5315]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] has declared: [[H5002]] “I [[H595]] abhor [[H8374]] Jacob’s [[H3290]] pride [[H1347]] and detest [[H8130]] his citadels, [[H759]] so I will deliver up [[H5462]] the city [[H5892]] and everything in it.” [[H4393]] 
9 And if [[H518]] there are [[H1961]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] left [[H3498]] in one [[H259]] house, [[H1004]] they too will die. [[H4191]] 
10 And when the relative [[H1730]] who is to burn [the bodies] [[H5635]] picks them up [[H5375]] to remove them [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the house, [[H1004]] he will call [[H559]] to one [[H834]] inside [[H3411]] of the house, [[H1004]] “Is anyone else [[H5750]] with you?” [[H5973]] “None,” [[H657]] that person will answer. [[H559]] “Silence,” [[H2013]] [the relative] will reply, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] must not [[H3808]] be invoked.” [[H2142]] 
11 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] gives a command: [[H6680]] “The great [[H1419]] house [[H1004]] will be smashed [[H5221]] to pieces, [[H7447]] and the small [[H6996]] house [[H1004]] to rubble.” [[H1233]] 
12 “Do horses [[H5483]] gallop [[H7323]] on the cliffs? [[H5553]] Does one plow [the sea] [[H2790]] with oxen? [[H1241]] But [[H3588]] you have turned [[H2015]] justice [[H4941]] into poison [[H7219]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of righteousness [[H6666]] into wormwood— [[H3939]] 
13 you who rejoice [[H8055]] over Lo-debar [[H1697]] and say, [[H559]] ‘Did we not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] Karnaim [[H7161]] by our own  strength?’ [[H2392]] 
14 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I will raise up [[H6965]] a nation [[H1471]] against you, [[H5921]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel,” [[H3478]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] “and they will oppress [[H3905]] you [[H853]] from Lebo-hamath [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the Brook [[H5158]] of the Arabah.” [[H6160]]
