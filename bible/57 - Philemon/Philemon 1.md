# Philemon 1
[[Titus 3|←]] • [[Hebrews 1|→]]
1 Paul, [[G3972]] a prisoner [[G1198]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] Timothy [[G5095]] [our] [[G3588]] brother, [[G80]] To Philemon [[G5371]] our [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] fellow worker, [[G4904]] 
2 to Apphia [[G682]] our [[G3588]] sister, [[G79]] to Archippus [[G751]] our [[G1473]] fellow soldier, [[G4961]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] [that meets] at [[G2596]] your [[G4771]] house: [[G3624]] 
3 Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
4 I always thank [[G2168]] my [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] making [[G4160]] mention [[G3417]] of you [[G4771]] in [[G1909]] my [[G1473]] prayers, [[G4335]] 
5 because I hear about [[G191]] your [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] love [[G26]] for [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]] 
6 [I pray] that [[G3704]] your [[G4771]] partnership [[G2842]] in the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] may become [[G1096]] effective [[G1756]] as [[G1722]] you fully acknowledge [[G1922]] every [[G3956]] good [thing] [[G18]] that [is] [[G3588]] ours [[G1473]] in [[G1519]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
7 I take [[G2192]] great [[G4183]] joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] encouragement [[G3874]] in [[G1909]] your [[G4771]] love, [[G26]] because [[G3754]] you, [[G4771]] brother, [[G80]] have refreshed [[G373]] the [[G3588]] hearts [[G4698]] of the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]] 
8 So [[G1352]] {although} in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] I am [[G2192]] bold [[G3954]] enough [[G4183]] to order [[G2004]] you [to do] [[G4771]] what [is] [[G3588]] proper, [[G433]] 
9 I prefer to appeal [[G3870]] on the basis of [[G1223]] love. [[G26]] [For] [[G5613]] I, [[G5108]] Paul, [[G3972]] am [[G1510]] now [[G3570]] aged, [[G4246]] and [[G1161]] a prisoner [[G1198]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] as well. [[G2532]] 
10 I appeal [[G3870]] to you [[G4771]] for [[G4012]] my [[G1699]] child [[G5043]] Onesimus, [[G3682]] whose [[G3739]] father I became [[G1080]] [while I was] in [[G1722]] chains. [[G1199]] 
11 Formerly [[G4218]] [he was] useless [[G890]] to you, [[G4771]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] [he has become] useful [[G2173]] both [[G2532]] to you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] to me. [[G1473]] 
12 I am sending back [[G375]] to you [[G4771]] him [[G846]] who [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] my [[G1699]] very heart. [[G4698]] 
13 I [[G1473]] would have liked [[G1014]] to keep [[G2722]] [him] [[G3739]] with [[G4314]] me, [[G1683]] so that [[G2443]] on your behalf [[G4771]] he could minister to [[G1247]] me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] [my] [[G3588]] chains [[G1199]] for the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]] 
14 But [[G1161]] I did [not] want [[G2309]] to do [[G4160]] [anything] [[G3762]] without [[G5565]] your [[G4674]] consent, [[G1106]] so that [[G2443]] your [[G4771]] goodness [[G18]] will not be [[G1510]] out of [[G2596]] compulsion, [[G318]] but [[G235]] by [[G2596]] your own free will. [[G1595]] 
15 For [[G1063]] perhaps [[G5029]] this is why [[G1223]] he was separated [from you] [[G5563]] for [[G4314]] a while, [[G5610]] so that [[G2443]] you might have him back [[G568]] for good— [[G166]] 
16 no longer [[G3765]] as [[G5613]] a slave, [[G1401]] but [[G235]] better than [[G5228]] a slave, [[G1401]] [as] a beloved [[G27]] brother. [[G80]] [He is] especially [ beloved ] [[G3122]] to me, [[G1473]] but [[G1161]] even more so [[G4214]] to you, [[G4771]] both [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] person [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
17 So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] you consider [[G2192]] me [[G1473]] a partner, [[G2844]] receive [[G4355]] him [[G846]] as [you would receive] [[G5613]] me. [[G1473]] 
18 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] he has wronged [[G91]] you [[G4771]] in any way [[G5100]] or [[G2228]] owes [you anything], [[G3784]] charge it to my account. [[G1677]] 
19 I, [[G1473]] Paul, [[G3972]] write [this] [[G1125]] with [[G3588]] my own [[G1699]] hand. [[G5495]] I [[G1473]] will repay [it]— [[G661]] not [[G3361]] to [[G2443]] mention [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] you owe [[G4359]] me [[G1473]] your very self. [[G4572]] 
20 Yes, [[G3483]] brother, [[G80]] let me have some benefit [[G3685]] from you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] Refresh [[G373]] my [[G1473]] heart [[G4698]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
21 Confident of [[G3982]] your [[G4771]] obedience, [[G5218]] I write [[G1125]] to you, [[G4771]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you will do [[G4160]] even [[G2532]] more [[G5228]] than [[G3739]] I ask. [[G3004]] 
22 In the meantime, [[G1161]] prepare [[G2090]] a guest room [[G3578]] for me, [[G1473]] because [[G1063]] I hope [[G1679]] that [[G3754]] through [[G1223]] your [[G4771]] prayers, [[G4335]] I will be restored [[G5483]] to you. [[G4771]] 
23 Epaphras, [[G1889]] my [[G1473]] fellow prisoner [[G4869]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] sends you greetings, [[G782]] 
24 [as do] Mark, [[G3138]] Aristarchus, [[G708]] Demas, [[G1214]] [and] Luke, [[G3065]] my [[G1473]] fellow workers. [[G4904]] 
25 The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [be] with [[G3326]] your [[G4771]] spirit. [[G4151]]
