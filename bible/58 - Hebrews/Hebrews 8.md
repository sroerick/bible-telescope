# Hebrews 8
[[Hebrews 7|←]] • [[Hebrews 9|→]]
1 [The] point [[G2774]] of [[G1909]] what [[G3588]] we are saying [is this]: [[G3004]] We do have [[G2192]] such [[G5108]] a high priest, [[G749]] who [[G3739]] sat down [[G2523]] at [[G1722]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of the [[G3588]] Majesty [[G3172]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] 
2 [and who] ministers [[G3011]] in the [[G3588]] sanctuary [[G40]] and [[G2532]] TRUE [[G228]] tabernacle [[G4633]] set up [[G4078]] by the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] not [[G3756]] by man. [[G444]] 
3 And since [[G1063]] every [[G3956]] high priest [[G749]] is appointed [[G2525]] to [[G1519]] offer [[G4374]] both [[G5037]] gifts [[G1435]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices, [[G2378]] [it was] [[G3606]] necessary [[G316]] [for] this One [[G3778]] also [[G2532]] to have [[G2192]] something [[G5100]] to offer. [[G4374]] 
4 Now [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] He were [[G1510]] on [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] He would not be [[G1510]] a priest, [[G2409]] since there are already [[G1510]] [priests] [[G3588]] to offer [[G4374]] gifts [[G1435]] according to [[G2596]] [the] Law. [[G3551]] 
5 [They] [[G3748]] serve at [[G3000]] a copy [[G5262]] and [[G2532]] shadow [[G4639]] of the [[G3588]] heavenly [sanctuary]. [[G2032]] That is why [[G2531]] Moses [[G3475]] was warned [[G5537]] when he was about [[G3195]] to build [[G2005]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle, [[G4633]] “See to it that [[G3708]] you make [[G4160]] everything [[G3956]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] pattern [[G5179]] shown [[G1166]] you [[G4771]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mountain. [[G3735]] 
6 Now, [[G3570]] however, [[G1161]] [Jesus] has received [[G5177]] a much [[G3745]] more excellent [[G1313]] ministry, [[G3009]] just as [[G2532]] the covenant [[G1242]] He mediates [[G3316]] is better [[G2909]] [and] [[G3748]] is founded [[G3549]] on [[G1909]] better [[G2909]] promises. [[G1860]] 
7 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] that [[G1565]] first [ covenant ] [[G4413]] had been [[G1510]] without fault, [[G273]] no [[G3756]] place [[G5117]] would have been sought [[G2212]] for a second. [[G1208]] 
8 [But] [[G1063]] [God] found fault [[G3201]] with [the people] [[G846]] [and] said: [[G3004]] “Behold, [[G2400]] [the] days [[G2250]] are coming, [[G2064]] declares [[G3004]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] [when] [[G2532]] I will make [[G4931]] a new [[G2537]] covenant [[G1242]] with [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Israel [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Judah. [[G2448]] 
9 [It will] not [[G3756]] be like [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] covenant [[G1242]] I made [[G4160]] with [[G3588]] their [[G846]] fathers [[G3962]] when [[G2250]] I [[G1473]] took [[G1949]] them [[G846]] by the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] to lead [[G1806]] them [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] [the] land [[G1093]] of Egypt, [[G125]] because [[G3754]] they [[G846]] did not abide [[G1696]] by [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] covenant, [[G1242]] and I [[G2504]] disregarded [[G272]] them, [[G846]] declares [[G3004]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
10 For [[G3754]] this [is] [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] covenant [[G1242]] I will make [[G1303]] with the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Israel [[G2474]] after [[G3326]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] declares [[G3004]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] I will put [[G1325]] My [[G1473]] laws [[G3551]] in [[G1519]] their [[G846]] minds, [[G1271]] and [[G2532]] inscribe [[G1924]] them [[G846]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] hearts. [[G2588]] And [[G2532]] I will be [[G1510]] their [[G846]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] will be [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] people. [[G2992]] 
11 No longer will each one teach [[G1321]] his [[G846]] neighbor [[G4177]] [or] [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] saying, [[G3004]] ‘Know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Lord,’ [[G2962]] because [[G3754]] they will all know [[G1492]] Me, [[G1473]] from [[G575]] [the] least [[G3398]] of them [[G846]] to [[G2193]] [the] greatest. [[G3173]] 
12 For [[G3754]] I will [[G1510]] forgive [[G2436]] their [[G846]] iniquities [[G93]] and [[G2532]] will remember [[G3403]] their [[G846]] sins [[G266]] no [[G3756]] more.” [[G2089]] 
13 By [[G1722]] speaking of [[G3004]] a new [covenant], [[G2537]] He has made [[G3822]] the [[G3588]] first one {obsolete}; [[G4413]] and [[G1161]] what [[G3588]] is obsolete [[G3822]] and [[G2532]] aging [[G1095]] will soon [[G1451]] disappear. [[G854]]
