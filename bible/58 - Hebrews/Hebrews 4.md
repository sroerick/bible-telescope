1 Therefore, [[G3767]] [ while ] the promise [[G1860]] of entering [[G1525]] His [[G846]] rest [[G2663]] still stands, [[G2641]] let us be careful [[G5399]] that none [[G3361]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] be deemed [[G1380]] to have fallen short [of it]. [[G5302]] 
2 For [[G1063]] we [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] received the good news, [[G2097]] just as [[G2509]] they [did]; [[G2548]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] they heard [[G189]] was of no value [[G5623]] to them, [[G1565]] since they did not share [[G4786]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of those who [[G3588]] comprehended [it]. [[G191]] 
3 Now [[G1063]] [we] who [[G3588]] have believed [[G4100]] enter [[G1525]] [that] [[G3588]] rest. [[G2663]] [As for the others, ] it is just as [[G2531]] [God] has said: [[G2046]] “So [[G5613]] I swore on oath [[G3660]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] anger, [[G3709]] ‘They shall never enter [[G1525]] My [[G1473]] rest.’” [[G2663]] And yet [[G2543]] [His] [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] have been finished [[G1096]] since [[G575]] [the] foundation [[G2602]] of [the] world. [[G2889]] 
4 For [[G1063]] somewhere [[G4225]] He has spoken [[G2046]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] seventh [day] [[G1442]] in this manner: [[G3779]] “And [[G2532]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] day [[G2250]] God [[G2316]] rested [[G2664]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] His [[G846]] works.” [[G2041]] 
5 And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] [as He says] in [[G1722]] [the passage above]: [[G3778]] “They shall never enter [[G1525]] My [[G1473]] rest.” [[G2663]] 
6 Since, [[G1893]] then, [[G3767]] it remains [for] [[G620]] some [[G5100]] to enter [[G1525]] [His rest], [[G846]] and [since] [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] formerly [[G4386]] heard the good news [[G2097]] did not enter [[G1525]] because of [[G1223]] [their] disobedience, [[G543]] 
7 [God] again designated [[G3724]] a certain [[G5100]] day [as] [[G2250]] “Today,” [[G4594]] when a long [[G5118]] time [[G5550]] later [[G3326]] He spoke [[G3004]] through [[G1722]] David [[G1138]] as [[G2531]] was just stated: [[G4302]] “Today, [[G4594]] if [[G1437]] you hear [[G191]] His [[G846]] voice, [[G5456]] {do} not [[G3361]] harden [[G4645]] your [[G4771]] hearts.” [[G2588]] 
8 Now [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] Joshua [[G2424]] had given them rest, [[G2664]] [God] would not have spoken [[G2980]] later [[G3326]] about [[G4012]] another [[G243]] day. [[G2250]] 
9 So [[G686]] there remains [[G620]] a Sabbath rest [[G4520]] for the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] of God. [[G2316]] 
10 For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3588]] enters [[G1525]] [God’s] [[G846]] rest [[G2663]] also [[G2532]] rests [[G2664]] from [[G575]] his [[G846]] [own] [[G3588]] work, [[G2041]] just as [[G5618]] God [did] [[G2316]] from [[G575]] [His]. [[G3588]] 
11 Let us, therefore, make every effort [[G4704]] to enter [[G1525]] that [[G1565]] rest, [[G2663]] so that [[G2443]] no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] will fall [[G4098]] by [following] [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] pattern [[G5262]] of disobedience. [[G543]] 
12 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] [is] living [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] active. [[G1756]] Sharper [[G5114]] than [[G5228]] any [[G3956]] double-edged [[G1366]] sword, [[G3162]] it pierces [[G1338]] even [[G2532]] to [[G891]] dividing [[G3311]] soul [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] spirit, [[G4151]] joints [[G719]] and [[G2532]] marrow. [[G3452]] It judges [[G2924]] [the] thoughts [[G1761]] and [[G2532]] intentions [[G1771]] of [the] heart. [[G2588]] 
13 Nothing [[G3756]] in all creation [[G2937]] is [[G1510]] hidden [[G852]] from [God’s] sight; [[G1799]] everything [[G3956]] [is] uncovered [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] exposed [[G5136]] before the [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] of Him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] whom [[G3739]] we [must give] [[G1473]] account. [[G3056]] 
14 Therefore, [[G3767]] since we have [[G2192]] [such] a great [[G3173]] high priest [[G749]] who has passed through [[G1330]] the [[G3588]] heavens, [[G3772]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] let us hold firmly to [[G2902]] what [[G3588]] we profess. [[G3671]] 
15 For [[G1063]] we do not have [[G2192]] a high priest [[G749]] who is unable [[G1410]] to sympathize [[G4834]] with [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] weaknesses, [[G769]] but [we have] [[G1161]] one who was tempted [[G3985]] in [[G2596]] every way [[G3956]] that [[G2596]] [we are], [[G3665]] [yet was] without [[G5565]] sin. [[G266]] 
16 Let us then approach [[G4334]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of grace [[G5485]] with [[G3326]] confidence, [[G3954]] so that [[G2443]] we may receive [[G2983]] mercy [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] find [[G2147]] grace [[G5485]] to [[G1519]] help [us] [[G996]] in [our] time of need. [[G2121]]
