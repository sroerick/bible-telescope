# Hebrews 1
[[Philemon 1|←]] • [[Hebrews 2|→]]
1 {On many} past [[G3819]] occasions [[G4181]] and [[G2532]] in many different ways, [[G4187]] God [[G2316]] spoke [[G2980]] to [our] [[G3588]] fathers [[G3962]] through [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]] 
2 But in [[G1909]] these [[G3778]] last [[G2078]] days [[G2250]] He has spoken [[G2980]] to us [[G1473]] by [[G1722]] [His] Son, [[G5207]] whom [[G3739]] He appointed [[G5087]] heir [[G2818]] of all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] He made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] universe. [[G165]] 
3 [The Son] [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] radiance [[G541]] of [God’s] [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] [the] exact representation [[G5481]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] nature, [[G5287]] upholding [[G5342]] all things [[G3956]] by [[G3588]] His [[G846]] powerful [[G1411]] word. [[G4487]] [After] [[G1223]] He had provided [[G4160]] purification [[G2512]] for sins, [[G266]] He sat down [[G2523]] at [[G1722]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of the [[G3588]] Majesty [[G3172]] on [[G1722]] high. [[G5308]] 
4 [So] He became [[G1096]] as far [[G5118]] superior [[G2909]] to the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] as [[G3745]] [the] name [[G3686]] He has inherited [[G2816]] [is] excellent [[G1313]] beyond [[G3844]] theirs. [[G846]] 
5 For [[G1063]] to which [[G5101]] of the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] did [God] ever say: [[G2036]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] Son; [[G5207]] today [[G4594]] I [[G1473]] have become Your Father”? [[G1080]] [Or] [[G2532]] again: [[G3825]] “I [[G1473]] will be [[G1510]] His [[G846]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] He [[G846]] will be [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] Son”? [[G5207]] 
6 And [[G1161]] again, [[G3825]] when [[G3752]] [God] brings [[G1521]] [His] [[G3588]] firstborn [[G4416]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G3625]] He says: [[G3004]] “{Let} all [[G3956]] God’s [[G2316]] angels [[G32]] worship [[G4352]] Him.” [[G846]] 
7 Now [[G2532]] about [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] He says: [[G3004]] “He [[G3588]] makes [[G4160]] His [[G846]] angels [[G32]] winds, [[G4151]] His [[G846]] servants [[G3011]] flames [[G5395]] of fire.” [[G4442]] 
8 But [[G1161]] about [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Son [He says]: [[G5207]] “Your [[G4771]] throne, [[G2362]] O [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] [endures] forever [[G1519]] and ever, [[G165]] and [[G2532]] justice [is] [[G2118]] the scepter [[G4464]] of [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] kingdom. [[G932]] 
9 You have loved [[G25]] righteousness [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] hated [[G3404]] wickedness; [[G458]] therefore [[G1223]] God, [[G2316]] Your [[G4771]] God, [[G2316]] { has placed } You [[G4771]] above [[G3844]] Your [[G4771]] companions [[G3353]] by anointing [ You ] [[G5548]] with [the] oil [[G1637]] of joy.” [[G20]] 
10 And: [[G2532]] “In [[G2596]] [the] beginning, [[G746]] O Lord, [[G2962]] You [[G4771]] laid the foundations [[G2311]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] are [[G1510]] [the] work [[G2041]] of [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] hands. [[G5495]] 
11 They [[G846]] will perish, [[G622]] but [[G1161]] You [[G4771]] remain; [[G1265]] they will all wear out [[G3822]] like [[G5613]] a garment. [[G2440]] 
12 You will roll them up [[G1667]] like [[G5616]] a robe; [[G4018]] like [[G5613]] a garment [[G2440]] they will be changed; [[G236]] but [[G1161]] You [[G4771]] remain [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] same, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] Your [[G4771]] years [[G2094]] will never end.” [[G1587]] 
13 But [[G1161]] to [[G4314]] which [[G5101]] of the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] did [God] ever say: [[G2046]] “Sit [[G2521]] at [[G1537]] My [[G1473]] right hand [[G1188]] until [[G2193]] I make [[G5087]] Your [[G4771]] enemies [[G2190]] a footstool [[G5286]] for [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] feet”? [[G4228]] 
14 Are [[G1510]] not [[G3780]] [the angels] [[G3956]] ministering [[G3010]] spirits [[G4151]] sent [[G649]] to serve [[G1248]] those who [[G3588]] will [[G3195]] inherit [[G2816]] salvation? [[G4991]]
