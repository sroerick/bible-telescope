# Hebrews 3
[[Hebrews 2|←]] • [[Hebrews 4|→]]
1 Therefore, [[G3606]] holy [[G40]] brothers, [[G80]] who share [[G3353]] in [the] heavenly [[G2032]] calling, [[G2821]] set your focus on [[G2657]] Jesus, [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] apostle [[G652]] and [[G2532]] high priest [[G749]] whom we [[G1473]] confess. [[G3671]] 
2 He was [[G1510]] faithful [[G4103]] to the [One who] [[G3588]] appointed [[G4160]] Him, [[G846]] just as [[G5613]] Moses [[G3475]] [was faithful] [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] [God’s] [[G846]] house. [[G3624]] 
3 For [[G1063]] [Jesus] [[G3778]] has been counted worthy [[G515]] of greater [[G4119]] glory [[G1391]] than [[G3844]] Moses, [[G3475]] just [[G2596]] as [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] builder [[G2680]] [of a house] [[G846]] has [[G2192]] greater [[G4119]] honor [[G5092]] than the [[G3588]] house [itself]. [[G3624]] 
4 And [[G1063]] every [[G3956]] house [[G3624]] is built [[G2680]] by [[G5259]] someone, [[G5100]] but [[G1161]] God [is] [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] builder [[G2680]] of everything. [[G3956]] 
5 Now [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] [was] faithful [[G4103]] as [[G5613]] a servant [[G2324]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] [God’s] [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] testifying [[G3142]] to what [[G3588]] would be spoken later. [[G2980]] 
6 But [[G1161]] Christ [is faithful] [[G5547]] as [[G5613]] [the] Son [[G5207]] over [[G1909]] [God’s] [[G846]] house. [[G3624]] [And] we [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] [His] [[G3739]] house, [[G3624]] if [[G1437]] we hold firmly [[G2722]] to [our] [[G3588]] confidence [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] [of which] [[G3588]] we boast. [[G2745]] 
7 Therefore, [[G1352]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] says: [[G3004]] “Today, [[G4594]] if [[G1437]] you hear [[G191]] His [[G846]] voice, [[G5456]] 
8 [do] not [[G3361]] harden [[G4645]] your [[G4771]] hearts, [[G2588]] as [you did] [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] rebellion, [[G3894]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2250]] of testing [[G3986]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] 
9 where [[G3757]] your [[G4771]] fathers [[G3962]] tested [[G3985]] [and] [[G1722]] tried [Me], [[G1382]] and [[G2532]] for forty [[G5062]] years [[G2094]] saw [[G3708]] My [[G1473]] works. [[G2041]] 
10 Therefore [[G1352]] I was angry [[G4360]] with [[G3588]] that [[G3778]] generation, [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] I said, [[G2036]] ‘Their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] always [[G104]] go astray, [[G4105]] and [[G1161]] they have not known [[G1097]] My [[G1473]] ways.’ [[G3598]] 
11 So [[G5613]] I swore on oath [[G3660]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] anger, [[G3709]] ‘They shall never enter [[G1525]] My [[G1473]] rest.’” [[G2663]] 
12 See to it, [[G991]] brothers, [[G80]] [that] [[G4219]] [none] [[G5100]] of you [[G4771]] has [[G1510]] a wicked [[G4190]] heart [[G2588]] of unbelief [[G570]] that turns away [[G868]] from [[G575]] [the] living [[G2198]] God. [[G2316]] 
13 But [[G235]] exhort [[G3870]] one another [[G1438]] daily, [[G2250]] as long as [[G891]] it is called [[G2564]] today, [[G4594]] so that [[G2443]] none [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] may be hardened [[G4645]] by sin’s [[G266]] deceitfulness. [[G539]] 
14 We have come [[G1096]] to share [[G3353]] in Christ [[G5547]] if [[G1437]] we hold [[G2722]] firmly [[G949]] to [[G3360]] [the] end [[G5056]] the [[G3588]] assurance [[G5287]] [we had] at first. [[G746]] 
15 As [[G1722]] it has been said: [[G3004]] “Today, [[G4594]] if [[G1437]] you hear [[G191]] His [[G846]] voice, [[G5456]] {do} not [[G3361]] harden [[G4645]] your [[G4771]] hearts, [[G2588]] as [you did] [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] rebellion.” [[G3894]] 
16 For [[G1063]] who were the ones who [[G5101]] heard [[G191]] [and] rebelled? [[G3893]] [Were they] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] those [[G3588]] Moses [[G3475]] led [[G1223]] out of [[G1537]] Egypt? [[G125]] 
17 And [[G1161]] with whom [[G5101]] was [God] angry [[G4360]] for forty [[G5062]] years? [[G2094]] [Was it] not [[G3780]] with those who [[G3588]] sinned, [[G264]] whose [[G3739]] bodies [[G2966]] fell [[G4098]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness? [[G2048]] 
18 And [[G1161]] to whom [[G5101]] did He swear [that they] [[G3660]] would never enter [[G1525]] His [[G846]] rest? [[G2663]] [Was it] [[G1487]] not [[G3361]] to those who [[G3588]] disobeyed? [[G544]] 
19 [So] [[G2532]] we see [[G991]] that [it was] [[G3754]] because of [[G1223]] [their] unbelief [[G570]] that they were unable [[G1410]] to enter. [[G1525]]
