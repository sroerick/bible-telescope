# Hebrews 6
[[Hebrews 5|←]] • [[Hebrews 7|→]]
1 Therefore [[G1352]] let us leave [[G863]] the [[G3588]] elementary [[G746]] teachings [[G3056]] about Christ [[G5547]] [and] go on [[G5342]] to [[G1909]] maturity, [[G5047]] not [[G3361]] laying [[G2598]] again [[G3825]] [the] foundation [[G2310]] of repentance [[G3341]] from [[G575]] dead [[G3498]] works, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] of faith [[G4102]] in [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]] 
2 instruction [[G1322]] about baptisms, [[G909]] [the] laying on [[G1936]] of hands, [[G5495]] [the] resurrection [[G386]] of [the] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] eternal [[G166]] judgment. [[G2917]] 
3 And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] we will do, [[G4160]] if [[G1437]] God [[G2316]] permits. [[G2010]] 
4 [It is] impossible [[G102]] for those who [[G3588]] have once been enlightened, [[G5461]] [who] have tasted [[G1089]] the [[G3588]] heavenly [[G2032]] gift, [[G1431]] [who] have shared [[G1096]] in [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] 
5 who have tasted [[G1089]] [the] goodness [[G2570]] [of the] word [[G4487]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G5037]] [the] powers [[G1411]] [of the] coming [[G3195]] age— [[G165]] 
6 and then [[G2532]] have fallen away— [[G3895]] to be restored [[G340]] again [[G3825]] to [[G1519]] repentance, [[G3341]] because they themselves are crucifying [[G388]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God {all over again} [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] subjecting [Him] to open shame. [[G3856]] 
7 Land [[G1093]] that drinks in [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] rain [[G5205]] often [[G4178]] falling [[G2064]] on [[G1909]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] that produces [[G5088]] a crop [[G1008]] useful [[G2111]] to those [[G1565]] for [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] it is tended [[G1090]] receives [[G3335]] [the] blessing [[G2129]] of [[G575]] God. [[G2316]] 
8 But [[G1161]] [land that] produces [[G1627]] thorns [[G173]] and [[G2532]] thistles [[G5146]] [is] worthless, [[G96]] and [[G2532]] [its] curse [[G2671]] is imminent. [[G1451]] [In] [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] it will be burned. [[G2740]] 
9 Even [[G2532]] though [[G1487]] we speak [[G2980]] like this, [[G3779]] beloved, [[G27]] we are convinced [[G3982]] of [[G3588]] better [things] [[G2908]] in [[G4012]] your [case]— [[G4771]] [things that] accompany [[G2192]] salvation. [[G4991]] 
10 God [[G2316]] [is] not [[G3756]] unjust. [[G94]] He will not forget [[G1950]] your [[G4771]] work [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] you have shown [[G1731]] for [[G1519]] His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] as you have ministered [[G1247]] to the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] continue to [do so]. [[G1247]] 
11 We want [[G1937]] each [[G1538]] of you [[G4771]] to show [[G1731]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] diligence [[G4710]] to [[G891]] [the very] end, [[G5056]] so that [[G4314]] [your] [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] may be fully assured. [[G4136]] 
12 Then [[G2443]] you will not be sluggish, [[G3576]] but [[G1161]] will imitate [[G3402]] those who [[G3588]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] patience [[G3115]] inherit [[G2816]] what has been promised. [[G1860]] 
13 [When] [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] made His promise [[G1861]] to Abraham, [[G11]] since [[G1893]] He had [[G2192]] no one [[G3762]] greater [[G3173]] to swear [[G3660]] by, [[G2596]] He swore [[G3660]] by [[G2596]] Himself, [[G1438]] 
14 saying, [[G3004]] “{I will} surely [[G3375]] bless [[G2127]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] multiply [[G4129]] your [descendants].” [[G4771]] 
15 And [[G2532]] so [Abraham], [[G3779]] after waiting patiently, [[G3114]] obtained [[G2013]] the [[G3588]] promise. [[G1860]] 
16 Men [[G444]] swear [[G3660]] by [[G2596]] [someone] [[G3588]] greater [than themselves], [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] [their] [[G3588]] oath [[G3727]] serves as [[G1519]] a confirmation [[G951]] to end [[G4009]] all [[G3956]] argument. [[G485]] 
17 So when [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] wanted [[G1014]] to make [[G1925]] the [[G3588]] unchanging nature [[G276]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] purpose [[G1012]] very clear [[G4053]] to the [[G3588]] heirs [[G2818]] of the [[G3588]] promise, [[G1860]] He guaranteed [it] [[G3315]] with an oath. [[G3727]] 
18 Thus [[G2443]] by [[G1223]] two [[G1417]] unchangeable [[G276]] things [[G4229]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] [it is] impossible [[G102]] [for] God [[G2316]] to lie, [[G5574]] we who have fled [[G2703]] to take hold [[G2902]] of the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] set before [us] [[G4295]] may be [[G2192]] strongly [[G2478]] encouraged. [[G3874]] 
19 We have [[G2192]] [this hope] [[G3739]] as [[G5613]] an anchor [[G45]] for the [[G3588]] soul, [[G5590]] firm [[G804]] and [[G2532]] steadfast. [[G949]] It enters [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] inner [sanctuary] [[G2082]] [behind] the [[G3588]] curtain, [[G2665]] 
20 where [[G3699]] Jesus [[G2424]] [our] forerunner [[G4274]] has entered [[G1525]] on our behalf. [[G1473]] He has become [[G1096]] a high priest [[G749]] forever [[G165]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchizedek. [[G3198]]
