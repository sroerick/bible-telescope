# Hebrews 2
[[Hebrews 1|←]] • [[Hebrews 3|→]]
1 We [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] pay closer attention, [[G4337]] therefore, [[G1223]] to what [[G3588]] we have heard, [[G191]] so that we do not drift away. [[G3901]] 
2 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] spoken [[G2980]] by [[G1223]] angels [[G32]] was [[G1096]] binding, [[G949]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] transgression [[G3847]] and [[G2532]] disobedience [[G3876]] received [[G2983]] [its] just [[G1738]] punishment, [[G3405]] 
3 how [[G4459]] shall we escape [[G1628]] if we neglect [[G272]] such a great [[G5082]] salvation? [[G4991]] [ This salvation ] [[G3748]] was [[G2983]] first [[G746]] announced [[G2980]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] was confirmed [[G950]] to [[G1519]] us [[G1473]] by [[G5259]] those who [[G3588]] heard [Him], [[G191]] 
4 [and] was affirmed [[G4901]] by God [[G2316]] through [[G5037]] signs, [[G4592]] wonders, [[G5059]] various [[G4164]] miracles, [[G1411]] and {gifts} [[G2532]] of [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] distributed [[G3311]] according to [[G2596]] His [[G846]] will. [[G2308]] 
5 For [[G1063]] [it is] not [[G3756]] to angels [[G32]] that He has subjected [[G5293]] the [[G3588]] world [[G3625]] to come, [[G3195]] about [[G4012]] which [[G3739]] we are speaking. [[G2980]] 
6 But [[G1161]] somewhere [[G4225]] it is testified [[G1263]] in these words: [[G3004]] “What [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] man [[G444]] that [[G3754]] You are mindful [[G3403]] of him, [[G846]] or [[G2228]] [the] son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] that [[G3754]] You care for [[G1980]] him? [[G846]] 
7 You made him a little lower [[G1642]] than [[G3844]] [the] angels; [[G32]] You crowned [[G4737]] him [[G846]] with glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honor [[G5092]] 
8 [and] placed [[G5293]] everything [[G3956]] under [[G5270]] his [[G846]] feet.” [[G4228]] [When God] [[G1722]] subjected [[G5293]] all things [[G3956]] to him, [[G846]] He left [[G863]] nothing [[G3762]] outside of his control. [[G506]] Yet [[G1161]] at present [[G3568]] we do not see [[G3708]] everything [[G3956]] subject [[G5293]] to him. [[G846]] 
9 But [[G1161]] we see [[G991]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] was made a little lower [[G1642]] than [[G3844]] [the] angels, [[G32]] now crowned [[G4737]] with glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honor [[G5092]] because [[G1223]] He suffered [[G3804]] death, [[G2288]] so that [[G3704]] by [the] grace [[G5485]] of God [[G2316]] He might taste [[G1089]] death [[G2288]] for [[G5228]] everyone. [[G3956]] 
10 In bringing [[G71]] many [[G4183]] sons [[G5207]] to [[G1519]] glory, [[G1391]] it was fitting [[G4241]] for [God], [[G846]] for [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] all things [exist], [[G3956]] to make [[G5048]] the [[G3588]] pioneer [[G747]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] salvation {perfect} [[G4991]] through [[G1223]] suffering. [[G3804]] 
11 For [[G1063]] both [[G5037]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sanctifies [[G37]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] are sanctified [[G37]] [are] [[G3956]] of [[G1537]] the same [family]. [[G1520]] That is why [[G1223]] [Jesus] is not ashamed [[G1870]] to call [[G2564]] them [[G846]] brothers. [[G80]] 
12 He says: [[G3004]] “I will proclaim [[G518]] Your [[G4771]] name [[G3686]] to [[G3588]] My [[G1473]] brothers; [[G80]] I will sing Your praises [[G5214]] in [[G1722]] [the] assembly.” [[G1577]] 
13 And [[G2532]] again: [[G3825]] “I [[G1473]] will [[G1510]] put [My] trust [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] Him.” [[G846]] And [[G2532]] [once] again: [[G3825]] “Here [[G2400]] [am] I, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] children [[G3813]] God [[G2316]] has given [[G1325]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
14 Therefore, [[G3767]] since [[G1893]] the [[G3588]] children [[G3813]] have [[G2841]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood, [[G129]] He [[G846]] too [[G2532]] shared in [[G3348]] [their] [[G3588]] [humanity], [[G846]] so that [[G2443]] by [[G1223]] [His] [[G3588]] death [[G2288]] He might destroy [[G2673]] him who [[G3588]] holds [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] power [[G2904]] of death, [[G2288]] that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] 
15 and [[G2532]] free [[G525]] those [[G3778]] who [[G3745]] all [[G3956]] [their] [[G3588]] lives [[G2198]] were [[G1510]] held [[G1777]] in slavery [[G1397]] by [[G1223]] [their] fear [[G5401]] of death. [[G2288]] 
16 For [[G1063]] surely [[G1211]] [it is] not [[G3756]] [the] angels [[G32]] He helps, [[G1949]] but [[G235]] [the] descendants [[G4690]] of Abraham. [[G11]] 
17 So [[G3606]] He had [[G3784]] to be made like [[G3666]] [His] [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] in [[G2596]] every way, [[G3956]] that [[G2443]] He might become [[G1096]] a merciful [[G1655]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] high priest [[G749]] [in service] [[G4314]] to God, [[G2316]] in order to [[G1519]] make atonement [[G2433]] for the [[G3588]] sins [[G266]] of the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]] 
18 Because [[G1063]] He Himself [[G846]] suffered [[G3958]] when He was tempted, [[G3985]] He is able [[G1410]] to help [[G997]] those who are [[G3588]] being tempted. [[G3985]]
