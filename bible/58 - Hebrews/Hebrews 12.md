1 Therefore, [[G5105]] [since] we [[G1473]] are [[G2192]] surrounded by [[G4029]] such a great [[G5118]] cloud [[G3509]] of witnesses, [[G3144]] let us throw off [[G659]] every [[G3956]] encumbrance [[G3591]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sin [that] [[G266]] so easily entangles, [[G2139]] [and] let us run [[G5143]] with [[G1223]] endurance [[G5281]] the [[G3588]] race [[G73]] set out for [[G4295]] us. [[G1473]] 
2 Let us fix our eyes [[G872]] on [[G1519]] Jesus, [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] pioneer [[G747]] and [[G2532]] perfecter [[G5051]] of [our] [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] who [[G3739]] for [[G473]] the [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] set before [[G4295]] Him [[G846]] endured [[G5278]] [the] cross, [[G4716]] scorning [[G2706]] [its] shame, [[G152]] and [[G5037]] sat down [[G2523]] at [[G1722]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of God. [[G2316]] 
3 Consider [[G357]] Him who [[G3588]] endured [[G5278]] such [[G5108]] hostility [[G485]] from [[G5259]] sinners, [[G268]] so that [[G2443]] you will not grow weary [[G2577]] [and] lose heart. [[G1590]] 
4 In your struggle [[G464]] against [[G4314]] sin, [[G266]] you have not yet resisted [[G478]] to the point of [[G3360]] shedding your blood. [[G129]] 
5 And [[G2532]] you have forgotten [[G1585]] the [[G3588]] exhortation [[G3874]] that [[G3748]] addresses [[G1256]] you [[G4771]] as [[G5613]] sons: [[G5207]] “My [[G1473]] son, [[G5207]] {do} not [[G3361]] make light of [[G3643]] [the] Lord’s [[G2962]] discipline, [[G3809]] [or] [[G3366]] lose heart [[G1590]] [when] He [[G846]] rebukes you. [[G1651]] 
6 For [[G1063]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] disciplines [[G3811]] the one [[G3739]] He loves, [[G25]] and [[G1161]] He chastises [[G3146]] everyone [[G3956]] He receives [[G3858]] [as a] son.” [[G5207]] 
7 Endure suffering [[G5278]] as [[G1519]] discipline; [[G3809]] God [[G2316]] is treating [[G4374]] you [[G4771]] as [[G5613]] sons. [[G5207]] For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] son [[G5207]] is not disciplined [[G3811]] [by his] father? [[G3962]] 
8 If [[G1487]] you do not experience [[G1510]] discipline [[G3809]] like [[G3739]] everyone [[G3956]] else, [[G3353]] then [[G686]] you are [[G1510]] illegitimate children [[G3541]] and [[G2532]] not true [[G3756]] sons. [[G5207]] 
9 Furthermore, [[G1534]] we have all had [[G2192]] earthly [[G4561]] fathers [[G3962]] who disciplined [us], [[G3810]] and [[G2532]] we respected [them]. [[G1788]] {Should we} not [[G3756]] much [[G4183]] more [[G1161]] submit [[G5293]] to the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] of [our] [[G3588]] spirits [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] live? [[G2198]] 
10 [Our fathers] disciplined [us] [[G3811]] for [[G4314]] a short [[G3641]] time [[G2250]] as [[G2596]] they [[G846]] thought best, [[G1380]] but [[G1161]] [God disciplines us] [[G3588]] for [[G1909]] [our] [[G3588]] good, [[G4851]] so that [[G1519]] we may share [[G3335]] in His [[G846]] holiness. [[G41]] 
11 No [[G3756]] discipline [[G3809]] seems [[G1380]] enjoyable [[G5479]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] time, [[G3918]] but [[G235]] painful. [[G3077]] Later on, [[G5305]] however, [[G1161]] it yields [[G591]] a peaceful [[G1516]] harvest [[G2590]] of righteousness [[G1343]] to those who [[G3588]] have been trained [[G1128]] by [[G1223]] it. [[G846]] 
12 Therefore [[G1352]] strengthen [[G461]] [your] [[G3588]] limp [[G3935]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] weak [[G3886]] knees. [[G1119]] 
13 Make [[G4160]] straight [[G3717]] paths [[G5163]] for [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] feet, [[G4228]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] lame [[G5560]] {will} not [[G3361]] be debilitated, [[G1624]] but [[G1161]] rather [[G3123]] healed. [[G2390]] 
14 Pursue [[G1377]] peace [[G1515]] with [[G3326]] all [men], [[G3956]] as well as [[G2532]] holiness, [[G38]] without [[G5565]] which [[G3739]] no one [[G3762]] will see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
15 Be careful that [[G1983]] no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] falls short [[G5302]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of God, [[G2316]] so that no [[G3361]] root [[G4491]] of bitterness [[G4088]] will spring [[G5453]] up [[G507]] to cause trouble [[G1776]] and [[G2532]] defile [[G3392]] many. [[G4183]] 
16 [See to it] that [[G3361]] [no one is] [[G5100]] sexually immoral, [[G4205]] or [[G2228]] is godless [[G952]] like [[G5613]] Esau, [[G2269]] who [[G3739]] sold [[G591]] his [[G1438]] birthright [[G4415]] for [[G473]] a single [[G1520]] meal. [[G1035]] 
17 For [[G1063]] you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] afterward, [[G3347]] when he wanted [[G2309]] to inherit [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] blessing, [[G2129]] he was rejected. [[G593]] He could find [[G2147]] no [[G3756]] ground [[G5117]] for repentance, [[G3341]] though [[G2539]] he sought [[G1567]] [the blessing] [[G846]] with [[G3326]] tears. [[G1144]] 
18 For [[G1063]] you have not come to [[G4334]] [ a mountain that ] can be touched [[G5584]] and [[G2532]] that is burning [[G2545]] with fire; [[G4442]] to darkness, [[G1105]] gloom, [[G2217]] and [[G2532]] storm; [[G2366]] 
19 to a trumpet [[G4536]] blast [[G2279]] [or] [[G2532]] to a voice [[G5456]] that [made] [[G3739]] [its] [[G3588]] hearers [[G191]] beg that [[G3868]] no further [[G3361]] word [[G3056]] be spoken. [[G4369]] 
20 For [[G1063]] they could not bear [[G5342]] what [[G3588]] was commanded: [[G1291]] “If even [[G2579]] an animal [[G2342]] touches [[G2345]] the [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] it must be stoned.” [[G3036]] 
21 The [[G3588]] sight [[G5324]] was [[G1510]] so [[G3779]] terrifying [[G5398]] [that] even [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] said, [[G2036]] “I am [[G1510]] trembling [[G1790]] with fear.” [[G1630]] 
22 Instead, [[G235]] you have come to [[G4334]] Mount [[G3735]] Zion, [[G4622]] [to the] city [[G4172]] of [the] living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] [the] heavenly [[G2032]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] [You have come] [[G2532]] to myriads [[G3461]] of angels [[G32]] 
23 in joyful assembly, [[G3831]] [to the] congregation [[G1577]] of [the] firstborn, [[G4416]] enrolled [[G583]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] [You have come] [[G2532]] to God [[G2316]] [the] judge [[G2923]] of all [men], [[G3956]] to [the] spirits [[G4151]] of [the] righteous [[G1342]] made perfect, [[G5048]] 
24 to Jesus [[G2424]] [the] mediator [[G3316]] of a new [[G3501]] covenant, [[G1242]] and [[G2532]] to [the] sprinkled [[G4473]] blood [[G129]] that speaks [[G2980]] a better word [[G2909]] than [[G3844]] [the blood] of [[G3588]] Abel. [[G6]] 
25 See to it that [[G991]] you do not refuse [[G3868]] Him who [[G3588]] speaks. [[G2980]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] [the people] [[G1565]] {did} not [[G3756]] escape [[G1628]] when they refused [[G3868]] Him who [[G3588]] warned [them] [[G5537]] on [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] how much [[G4183]] less [[G3123]] [will] we [escape] [[G1473]] if we reject [[G654]] Him who [warns us] [[G3588]] from [[G575]] heaven? [[G3772]] 
26 At that time [[G5119]] [His] [[G3739]] voice [[G5456]] shook [[G4531]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] He has promised, [[G1861]] “Once more [[G530]] I [[G1473]] will shake [[G4579]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] but [[G235]] heaven [[G3772]] as well.” [[G2532]] 
27 The [words], [[G3588]] “Once more,” [[G530]] signify [[G1213]] the [[G3588]] removal [[G3331]] of what [[G3588]] can be shaken— [[G4531]] that is, [[G5613]] created things— [[G4160]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] unshakable [[G4531]] may remain. [[G3306]] 
28 Therefore, [[G1352]] [since] we are receiving [[G3880]] an unshakable [[G761]] kingdom, [[G932]] let us be filled with [[G2192]] gratitude, [[G5485]] [and so] [[G1223]] worship [[G3000]] God [[G2316]] acceptably [[G2102]] with [[G3326]] reverence [[G2124]] and [[G2532]] awe. [[G1169]] 
29 For [[G1063]] our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] [is a] consuming [[G2654]] fire. [[G4442]]
