# Hebrews 13
[[Hebrews 12|←]] • [[James 1|→]]
1 Continue [[G3306]] in brotherly love. [[G5360]] 
2 {Do} not [[G3361]] neglect [[G1950]] to show hospitality to strangers, [[G5381]] for [[G1063]] by so doing [[G1223]] some [people] [[G5100]] have entertained [[G3579]] angels [[G32]] without knowing it. [[G2990]] 
3 Remember [[G3403]] those [[G3588]] in prison [[G1198]] as if [[G5613]] you were bound with [them], [[G4887]] [and] those who [[G3588]] are mistreated [[G2558]] as if [[G5613]] you [[G846]] were [[G1510]] [suffering with them]. [[G4983]] 
4 Marriage [[G1062]] should be honored [[G5093]] by [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] marriage bed [[G2845]] kept undefiled, [[G283]] for [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] will judge [[G2919]] the sexually immoral [[G4205]] and [[G2532]] adulterers. [[G3432]] 
5 Keep your lives [[G5158]] free from the love of money [[G866]] [and] be content [[G714]] with what [[G3588]] you have, [[G3918]] for [[G1063]] [God] [[G846]] has said: [[G2046]] “Never [[G3756]] will I leave [[G447]] you, [[G4771]] never [[G3756]] will I forsake [[G1459]] you.” [[G4771]] 
6 So [[G5620]] we [[G1473]] say [[G3004]] with confidence: [[G2292]] “[The] Lord [is] [[G2962]] my [[G1473]] helper; [[G998]] I will not be afraid. [[G5399]] What [[G5101]] {can} man [[G444]] do [[G4160]] to me?” [[G1473]] 
7 Remember [[G3421]] your [[G4771]] leaders [[G2233]] who [[G3748]] spoke [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] to you. [[G4771]] Consider [[G333]] the [[G3588]] outcome [[G1545]] of [their] [[G3739]] way of life [[G391]] [and] imitate [[G3401]] [their] [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] 
8 Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [is] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] yesterday [[G5504]] and [[G2532]] today [[G4594]] and [[G2532]] forever. [[G165]] 
9 {Do} not [[G3361]] be carried away [by] [[G3911]] all kinds [[G4164]] [of] strange [[G3581]] teachings, [[G1322]] for [[G1063]] [it is] good [[G2570]] for the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] to be strengthened [[G950]] by grace [[G5485]] [and] not [[G3756]] by [ceremonial] foods, [[G1033]] which [[G3739]] are of no value [[G5623]] to those [[G3588]] devoted [[G4043]] to [them]. [[G1722]] 
10 We have [[G2192]] an altar [[G2379]] from [[G1537]] which [[G3739]] those who [[G3588]] serve [[G3000]] at the [[G3588]] tabernacle [[G4633]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] right [[G1849]] to eat. [[G5315]] 
11 [Although] [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] brings [[G1533]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of animals [[G2226]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Holy Place [[G40]] [as a sacrifice] for [[G4012]] sin, [[G266]] the [[G3588]] bodies [[G4983]] are burned [[G2618]] outside [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] camp. [[G3925]] 
12 And [[G2532]] that is why [[G1352]] Jesus [[G2424]] suffered [[G3958]] outside [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] [city] gate, [[G4439]] to [[G2443]] sanctify [[G37]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] by [[G1223]] [His] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] blood. [[G129]] 
13 Therefore [[G5106]] let us go [[G1831]] to [[G4314]] Him [[G846]] outside [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] camp, [[G3925]] bearing [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] disgrace [[G3680]] He [bore]. [[G846]] 
14 For [[G1063]] here [[G5602]] we do not have [[G2192]] a permanent [[G3306]] city, [[G4172]] but [[G235]] we are looking for [[G1934]] the [[G3588]] [city] that is to come. [[G3195]] 
15 Through [[G1223]] [Jesus], [[G846]] therefore, [[G3767]] let us continually offer [[G399]] to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] [a] sacrifice [[G2378]] of praise, [[G133]] [the] fruit [[G2590]] of lips [[G5491]] that confess [[G3670]] His [[G846]] name. [[G3686]] 
16 And [[G1161]] {do} not [[G3361]] neglect [[G1950]] to do good [[G2140]] and [[G2532]] to share with others, [[G2842]] for [[G1063]] with such [[G5108]] sacrifices [[G2378]] God [[G2316]] is pleased. [[G2100]] 
17 Obey [[G3982]] your [[G4771]] leaders [[G2233]] and [[G2532]] submit [to them], [[G5226]] for [[G1063]] they [[G846]] watch [[G69]] over [[G5228]] your [[G4771]] souls [[G5590]] as [[G5613]] those who must give [[G591]] an account. [[G3056]] To this end, [[G2443]] allow them [[G4160]] [to lead] [[G3778]] with [[G3326]] joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] [with] grief, [[G4727]] for [[G1063]] that [[G3778]] [would be] of no advantage [[G255]] to you. [[G4771]] 
18 Pray [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] us; [[G1473]] we are convinced [[G3982]] that [[G3754]] we have [[G2192]] a clear [[G2570]] conscience [[G4893]] [and] desire [[G2309]] to live [[G390]] honorably [[G2573]] in [[G1722]] every way. [[G3956]] 
19 And [[G1161]] I especially urge [[G3870]] you to [pray] [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] I may be restored [[G600]] to you [[G4771]] soon. [[G5032]] 
20 Now {may} [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of peace, [[G1515]] who [[G3588]] through [[G1722]] [the] blood [[G129]] of [the] eternal [[G166]] covenant [[G1242]] brought [[G321]] back from [[G1537]] [the] dead [[G3498]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] Shepherd [[G4166]] of the [[G3588]] sheep, [[G4263]] 
21 equip [[G2675]] you [[G4771]] with [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] good {thing} [[G18]] to [[G1519]] do [[G4160]] His [[G846]] will. [[G2307]] [And] may He accomplish [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] us [[G1473]] what [is] [[G3588]] pleasing [[G2101]] in His sight [[G1799]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] to whom [be] [[G3739]] glory [[G1391]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]] 
22 I urge [[G3870]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] to bear with [[G430]] [my] [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of exhortation, [[G3874]] for [[G1063]] I have {only} written [[G1989]] you [[G4771]] briefly. [[G1024]] 
23 Be aware [that] [[G1097]] our [[G1473]] brother [[G80]] Timothy [[G5095]] has been released. [[G630]] If [[G1437]] he arrives [[G2064]] soon, [[G5032]] I will come [[G3708]] with [[G3326]] [him] {to see} [[G3739]] you. [[G4771]] 
24 Greet [[G782]] all [[G3956]] your [[G4771]] leaders [[G2233]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]] Those [[G3588]] from [[G575]] Italy [[G2482]] send you greetings. [[G782]] 
25 Grace [be] [[G5485]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] of you. [[G4771]]
