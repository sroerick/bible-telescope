1 But [[G1161]] understand [[G1097]] this: [[G3778]] In [[G1722]] [the] last [[G2078]] days [[G2250]] terrible [[G5467]] times [[G2540]] will come. [[G1764]] 
2 For [[G1063]] men [[G444]] will be [[G1510]] lovers of themselves, [[G5367]] lovers of money, [[G5366]] boastful, [[G213]] arrogant, [[G5244]] abusive, [[G989]] disobedient [[G545]] to [their] parents, [[G1118]] ungrateful, [[G884]] unholy, [[G462]] 
3 unloving, [[G794]] unforgiving, [[G786]] slanderous, [[G1228]] without self-control, [[G193]] brutal, [[G434]] without love of good, [[G865]] 
4 traitorous, [[G4273]] reckless, [[G4312]] conceited, [[G5187]] lovers of pleasure [[G5369]] rather [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] lovers of God, [[G5377]] 
5 having [[G2192]] a form [[G3446]] of godliness [[G2150]] but [[G1161]] denying [[G720]] its [[G846]] power. [[G1411]] Turn away from [[G665]] [such] as these! [[G3778]] 
6 They are [[G1510]] the kind who [[G3778]] worm their way [[G1744]] into [[G1519]] households [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] captivate [[G163]] vulnerable women [[G1133]] who are weighed down [[G4987]] with sins [[G266]] [and] led astray [[G71]] by various [[G4164]] passions, [[G1939]] 
7 always [[G3842]] learning [[G3129]] [but] [[G2532]] never [[G3368]] able [[G1410]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] a knowledge [[G1922]] of [the] truth. [[G225]] 
8 Just as [[G3739]] Jannes [[G2389]] and [[G2532]] Jambres [[G2387]] opposed [[G436]] Moses, [[G3475]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] men [[G444]] oppose [[G436]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] They are depraved [[G2704]] in mind [[G3563]] [and] disqualified [[G96]] from [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] 
9 But [[G235]] they will not advance [[G4298]] much [[G4119]] further. [[G1909]] For [[G1063]] just [[G2532]] like [[G5613]] [Jannes and Jambres], [[G1565]] their [[G846]] folly [[G454]] will be [[G1510]] plain [[G1552]] to everyone. [[G3956]] 
10 You, [[G4771]] however, [[G1161]] have observed [[G3877]] my [[G1473]] teaching, [[G1319]] [my] [[G3588]] conduct, [[G72]] [my] [[G3588]] purpose, [[G4286]] [my] [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] [my] [[G3588]] patience, [[G3115]] [my] [[G3588]] love, [[G26]] [my] [[G3588]] endurance, [[G5281]] 
11 [my] [[G3588]] persecutions, [[G1375]] [and the] [[G3588]] sufferings [[G3804]] that [[G3634]] came upon [[G1096]] me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] Antioch, [[G490]] Iconium, [[G2430]] [and] [[G1722]] Lystra. [[G3082]] What [[G3634]] persecutions [[G1375]] I endured! [[G5297]] Yet [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] rescued [[G4506]] me [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] all [of them]. [[G3956]] 
12 Indeed, [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] desire [[G2309]] to live [[G2198]] godly [lives] [[G2153]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] will be persecuted, [[G1377]] 
13 while [[G1161]] evil [[G4190]] men [[G444]] and [[G2532]] imposters [[G1114]] go [from bad] [[G4298]] to [[G1909]] worse, [[G5501]] deceiving [[G4105]] and [[G2532]] being deceived. [[G4105]] 
14 But [[G1161]] [as for] you, [[G4771]] continue [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the things [[G3739]] you have learned [[G3129]] and [[G2532]] firmly believed, [[G4104]] since you know [[G1492]] from [[G3844]] whom [[G5101]] you learned [them]. [[G3129]] 
15 From [[G575]] infancy [[G1025]] you have known [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G2413]] Scriptures, [[G1121]] which [[G3588]] are able [[G1410]] to make you wise [[G4679]] for [[G1519]] salvation [[G4991]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
16 All [[G3956]] Scripture [is] [[G1124]] God-breathed [[G2315]] and [[G2532]] is useful [[G5624]] for [[G4314]] instruction, [[G1319]] for [[G4314]] conviction, [[G1650]] for [[G4314]] correction, [[G1882]] [and] for [[G4314]] training [[G3809]] in [[G1722]] righteousness, [[G1343]] 
17 so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] of God [[G2316]] may be [[G1510]] complete, [[G739]] fully equipped [[G1822]] for [[G4314]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work. [[G2041]]
