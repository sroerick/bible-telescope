[[1 Timothy 6|←]] • [[2 Timothy 2|→]]
1 Paul, [[G3972]] an apostle [[G652]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] by [[G1223]] [the] will [[G2307]] of God, [[G2316]] according to [[G2596]] [the] promise [[G1860]] of life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] 
2 To Timothy, [[G5095]] [my] beloved [[G27]] child: [[G5043]] Grace, [[G5485]] mercy, [[G1656]] [and] peace [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
3 I [[G2192]] thank [[G5485]] God, [[G2316]] whom [[G3739]] I serve [[G3000]] with [[G1722]] a clear [[G2513]] conscience [[G4893]] as did [[G575]] [my] forefathers, [[G4269]] as [[G5613]] I [[G2192]] constantly [[G88]] remember [[G3417]] you [[G4771]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] prayers. [[G1162]] 
4 Recalling [[G3403]] your [[G4771]] tears, [[G1144]] I long [[G1971]] to see [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] so that [[G2443]] I may be filled [[G4137]] with joy. [[G5479]] 
5 I am reminded [[G5280]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] sincere [[G505]] faith, [[G4102]] which [[G3748]] first [[G4412]] dwelt [[G1774]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] grandmother [[G3125]] Lois [[G3090]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] mother [[G3384]] Eunice, [[G2131]] and [[G1161]] I am convinced [[G3982]] [is] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] as well. [[G2532]] 
6 For [[G1223]] this [[G3739]] reason [[G156]] I remind [[G363]] you [[G4771]] to fan into flame [[G329]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G5486]] of God, [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] laying on [[G1936]] of [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] hands. [[G5495]] 
7 For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] {has} not [[G3756]] given [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] a spirit [[G4151]] of timidity, [[G1167]] but [[G235]] of power, [[G1411]] love, [[G26]] and [[G2532]] self-control. [[G4995]] 
8 So [[G3767]] do not be ashamed of [[G1870]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3142]] of [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] Lord, [[G2962]] [or] [[G3366]] of me, [[G1473]] His [[G846]] prisoner. [[G1198]] Instead, [[G235]] join me in suffering [[G4777]] for the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] by [[G2596]] [the] power [[G1411]] of God. [[G2316]] 
9 [He] [[G3588]] has saved [[G4982]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] called [us] [[G2564]] with a holy [[G40]] calling, [[G2821]] not [[G3756]] because of [[G2596]] our [[G1473]] [own] [[G3588]] works, [[G2041]] but [[G235]] by [[G2596]] His own [[G2398]] purpose [[G4286]] and [[G2532]] [by the] grace [[G5485]] He granted [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] before [[G4253]] time [[G5550]] eternal. [[G166]] 
10 And [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] He has revealed [this grace] [[G5319]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] appearing [[G2015]] of our [[G1473]] Savior, [[G4990]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] [who] has abolished [[G2673]] death [[G2288]] and [[G1161]] illuminated the way to [[G5461]] life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] immortality [[G861]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] 
11 to [[G1519]] which [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] was appointed [[G5087]] a preacher, [[G2783]] apostle, [[G652]] and [[G2532]] teacher. [[G1320]] 
12 For [[G1223]] this [[G3739]] reason, [[G156]] even [though] [[G2532]] I suffer [[G3958]] [as I do], [[G3778]] I am not ashamed; [[G1870]] for [[G1063]] I know [[G1492]] whom [[G3739]] I have believed, [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] I am convinced [[G3982]] that [[G3754]] He is [[G1510]] able [[G1415]] to guard [[G5442]] what I have entrusted [to Him] [[G3866]] for [[G1519]] that [[G1565]] day. [[G2250]] 
13 Hold on [[G2192]] [to the] pattern [[G5296]] of sound [[G5198]] teaching [[G3056]] you have heard [[G191]] from [[G3844]] me, [[G1473]] with [[G1722]] [the] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] love [[G26]] that [are] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
14 Guard [[G5442]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] treasure entrusted [to you], [[G3866]] with the help of [[G1223]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] who [[G3588]] dwells [[G1774]] in [[G1722]] us. [[G1473]] 
15 You know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] everyone [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] [the Province of] Asia [[G773]] has deserted [[G654]] me, [[G1473]] including [[G3739]] Phygelus [[G5436]] and [[G2532]] Hermogenes. [[G2061]] 
16 {May} the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] grant [[G1325]] mercy [[G1656]] to the [[G3588]] household [[G3624]] of Onesiphorus, [[G3683]] because [[G3754]] he has often refreshed [[G404]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] was unashamed of [[G1870]] my [[G1473]] chains. [[G254]] 
17 Indeed, [[G235]] when he arrived [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Rome, [[G4516]] he searched diligently [[G2212]] [until] [[G2532]] he found [[G2147]] me. [[G1473]] 
18 {May} the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] grant [[G1325]] [Onesiphorus] [[G846]] [His] [[G2962]] mercy [[G1656]] on [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day. [[G2250]] You [[G4771]] know [[G1097]] very well [[G957]] how much [[G3745]] he ministered [to me] [[G1247]] in [[G1722]] Ephesus. [[G2181]]
