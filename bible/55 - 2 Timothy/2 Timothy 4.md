# 2 Timothy 4
[[2 Timothy 3|←]] • [[Titus 1|→]]
1 I charge [you] [[G1263]] in the presence [[G1799]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] will [[G3195]] judge [[G2919]] [the] living [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] and [in view] [[G2532]] of His [[G846]] appearing [[G2015]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] kingdom: [[G932]] 
2 Preach [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] word; [[G3056]] be prepared [[G2186]] in season [[G2122]] [and] out of season; [[G171]] reprove, [[G1651]] rebuke, [[G2008]] [and] encourage [[G3870]] with [[G1722]] every [ form of] [[G3956]] patient [[G3115]] instruction. [[G1322]] 
3 For [[G1063]] [the] time [[G2540]] will come [[G1510]] when [[G3753]] men will not tolerate [[G430]] sound [[G5198]] doctrine, [[G1319]] but [[G235]] with itching [[G2833]] ears [[G189]] they will gather around [[G2002]] themselves [[G1438]] teachers [[G1320]] to suit [[G2596]] [their] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] desires. [[G1939]] 
4 [So] [[G2532]] they will turn [[G654]] [their] [[G3588]] ears {away} [[G189]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] and [[G1161]] turn aside [[G1624]] to [[G1909]] myths. [[G3454]] 
5 But [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] be sober [[G3525]] in [[G1722]] all things, [[G3956]] endure hardship, [[G2553]] do [[G4160]] [the] work [[G2041]] of an evangelist, [[G2099]] fulfill [[G4135]] your [[G4771]] ministry. [[G1248]] 
6 For [[G1063]] I {am} [[G1473]] already [[G2235]] being poured out like a drink offering, [[G4689]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] of [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] departure [[G359]] is at hand. [[G2186]] 
7 I have fought [[G75]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] fight, [[G73]] I have finished [[G5055]] the [[G3588]] race, [[G1408]] I have kept [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] 
8 From now on [[G3063]] the [[G3588]] crown [[G4735]] of righteousness [[G1343]] is laid up [[G606]] for me, [[G1473]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] judge, [[G2923]] will award [[G591]] to me [[G1473]] on [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day— [[G2250]] and [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] to me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] to all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] crave [[G25]] His [[G846]] appearing. [[G2015]] 
9 Make every effort [[G4704]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me [[G1473]] quickly, [[G5030]] 
10 because [[G1063]] Demas, [[G1214]] in his love of [[G25]] this [[G3568]] [world], [[G165]] has deserted [[G1459]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] gone [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Thessalonica. [[G2332]] Crescens [has gone] [[G2913]] to [[G1519]] Galatia, [[G1053]] [and] Titus [[G5103]] to [[G1519]] Dalmatia. [[G1149]] 
11 Only [[G3441]] Luke [[G3065]] is [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] me. [[G1473]] Get [[G353]] Mark [[G3138]] [and] bring [him] [[G71]] with [[G3326]] you, [[G4572]] because [[G1063]] he is [[G1510]] useful [[G2173]] to me [[G1473]] in [[G1519]] [the] ministry. [[G1248]] 
12 Tychicus, [[G5190]] however, [[G1161]] I have sent [[G649]] to [[G1519]] Ephesus. [[G2181]] 
13 When you come, [[G2064]] bring [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] cloak [[G5341]] that [[G3739]] I left [[G620]] with [[G3844]] Carpus [[G2591]] at [[G1722]] Troas, [[G5174]] and [[G2532]] [my] [[G3588]] scrolls, [[G975]] especially [[G3122]] the [[G3588]] parchments. [[G3200]] 
14 Alexander [[G223]] the [[G3588]] coppersmith [[G5471]] did [[G1731]] great [[G4183]] harm [[G2556]] to me. [[G1473]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] will repay [[G591]] him [[G846]] according to [[G2596]] his [[G846]] deeds. [[G2041]] 
15 You [[G4771]] too [[G2532]] should beware of [[G5442]] [him], [[G3739]] for [[G1063]] he has vigorously opposed [[G436]] our [[G2251]] message. [[G3056]] 
16 At [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] first [[G4413]] defense, [[G627]] no one [[G3762]] stood with [[G3854]] me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] everyone [[G3956]] deserted [[G1459]] me. [[G1473]] May it not be charged [[G3049]] against them. [[G846]] 
17 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] stood by [[G3936]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] strengthened [[G1743]] me, [[G1473]] so that [[G2443]] through [[G1223]] me [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] message [[G2782]] would be fully proclaimed, [[G4135]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] would hear [it]. [[G191]] [So] [[G2532]] I was delivered [[G4506]] from [[G1537]] [the] mouth [[G4750]] of the lion. [[G3023]] 
18 [And] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] will rescue [[G4506]] me [[G1473]] from [[G575]] every [[G3956]] evil [[G4190]] action [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] bring [me] safely [[G4982]] into [[G1519]] His [[G846]] heavenly [[G2032]] kingdom. [[G932]] To Him [be] [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]] 
19 Greet [[G782]] Prisca [[G4251]] and [[G2532]] Aquila, [[G207]] as well as [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] household [[G3624]] of Onesiphorus. [[G3683]] 
20 Erastus [[G2037]] has remained [[G3306]] at [[G1722]] Corinth, [[G2882]] and [[G1161]] Trophimus [[G5161]] I left [[G620]] sick [[G770]] in [[G1722]] Miletus. [[G3399]] 
21 Make every effort [[G4704]] to come [ to me ] [[G2064]] before [[G4253]] winter. [[G5494]] Eubulus [[G2103]] sends you greetings, [[G782]] as do [[G2532]] Pudens, [[G4227]] Linus, [[G3044]] Claudia, [[G2803]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]] 
22 The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] [be] with [[G3326]] your [[G4771]] spirit. [[G4151]] Grace [be] [[G5485]] with [[G3326]] you all. [[G4771]]
