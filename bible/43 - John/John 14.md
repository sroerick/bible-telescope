1 {Do} not {let} [[G3361]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] be troubled. [[G5015]] You believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] God; [[G2316]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me [[G1473]] as well. [[G2532]] 
2 In [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] Father’s [[G3962]] house [[G3614]] are [[G1510]] many [[G4183]] rooms. [[G3438]] If [[G1487]] [it were] not [[G3361]] so, [[G302]] would I have told [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] I am going there [[G4198]] to prepare [[G2090]] a place [[G5117]] for you? [[G4771]] 
3 And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] I go [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] prepare [[G2090]] a place [[G5117]] for you, [[G4771]] I will come [[G2064]] back [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] welcome [[G3880]] you [[G4771]] into [[G4314]] My presence, [[G1683]] so that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] may be [[G1510]] where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am. [[G1510]] 
4 You know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] to the place where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am going.” [[G5217]] 
5 “Lord,” [[G2962]] said [[G3004]] Thomas, [[G2381]] “we do not know [[G1492]] where [[G4226]] You are going, [[G5217]] [so] how [[G4459]] can we [[G1410]] know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] way?” [[G3598]] 
6 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] life. [[G2222]] No one [[G3762]] comes [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] except [[G1487]] through [[G1223]] Me. [[G1473]] 
7 If [[G1487]] you had known [[G1097]] Me, [[G1473]] you would know [[G1492]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] as well. [[G302]] From [[G575]] now on [[G737]] you do know [[G1097]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] have seen [[G3708]] Him.” [[G846]] 
8 Philip [[G5376]] said [[G3004]] to Him, [[G846]] “Lord, [[G2962]] show [[G1166]] us [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] that will be enough [[G714]] for us.” [[G1473]] 
9 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G3004]] “Philip, [[G5376]] I have been [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] all this [[G5118]] time, [[G5550]] and [[G2532]] still you do not know [[G1097]] Me? [[G1473]] Anyone who [[G3588]] has seen [[G3708]] Me [[G1473]] has seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] How [[G4459]] {can} you [[G4771]] say, [[G3004]] Show [[G1166]] us [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] Father? [[G3962]] 
10 Do you not believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] I [am] [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Me? [[G1473]] The [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] I [[G1473]] say [[G3004]] to you, [[G4771]] I do not speak [[G2980]] on [[G575]] My own. [[G1683]] Instead, [[G1161]] {it is} the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] dwelling [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Me, [[G1473]] performing [[G4160]] His [[G846]] works. [[G2041]] 
11 Believe [[G4100]] Me [[G1473]] that [[G3754]] I [am] [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] [is] in [[G1722]] Me— [[G1473]] or at least [[G1161]] believe [[G4100]] on account of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] themselves. [[G846]] 
12 Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whoever [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me [[G1473]] will also do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am doing. [[G4160]] He will do [[G4160]] even [[G2532]] greater [things] [[G3173]] than these, [[G3778]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am going [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] 
13 And [[G2532]] I will do [[G4160]] whatever [[G3754]] you ask [[G154]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] may be glorified [[G1392]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Son. [[G5207]] 
14 If [[G1437]] you ask [[G154]] Me [[G1473]] anything [[G5100]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] I [[G1473]] will do [it]. [[G4160]] 
15 If [[G1437]] you love [[G25]] Me, [[G1473]] you will keep [[G5083]] My [[G1699]] commandments. [[G1785]] 
16 And I [[G2504]] will ask [[G2065]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] He will give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] another [[G243]] Advocate [[G3875]] to [[G2443]] be [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] forever— [[G165]] 
17 the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of truth. [[G225]] The [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] cannot [[G1410]] receive [[G2983]] [Him], [[G3739]] because [[G3754]] it neither sees [[G2334]] Him [[G846]] nor [[G3761]] knows [Him]. [[G1097]] But you [[G4771]] do know [[G1097]] Him, [[G846]] for [[G3754]] He abides [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] will be [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] 
18 I will not leave [[G863]] you [[G4771]] as orphans; [[G3737]] I will come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]] 
19 In [[G2089]] a little while, [[G3398]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] will see [[G2334]] Me [[G1473]] no more, [[G3765]] but [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] will see [[G2334]] Me. [[G1473]] Because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] live, [[G2198]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] will live. [[G2198]] 
20 On [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] you [[G4771]] will know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I [am] [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] you [are] [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] Me, [[G1473]] and I [am] [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] 
21 Whoever [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] My [[G1473]] commandments [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] keeps [[G5083]] them [[G846]] is [[G1510]] the [one who] [[G3588]] loves [[G25]] Me. [[G1473]] The [one who] [[G3588]] loves [[G25]] Me [[G1473]] will be loved [[G25]] by [[G5259]] My [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] and I [[G2504]] will love [[G25]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] reveal [[G1718]] Myself [[G1683]] to him. [[G846]] 
22 Judas [[G2455]] (not [[G3756]] Iscariot) [[G2469]] asked [[G3004]] Him, [[G846]] “Lord, [[G2962]] why [[G5101]] are You going [[G3195]] to reveal [[G1718]] Yourself [[G4572]] to us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3780]] to the [[G3588]] world?” [[G2889]] 
23 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] loves [[G25]] Me, [[G1473]] he will keep [[G5083]] My [[G1473]] word. [[G3056]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] will love [[G25]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] we will come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] make [[G4160]] Our home [[G3438]] with [[G3844]] him. [[G846]] 
24 Whoever [[G3588]] does not love [[G25]] Me [[G1473]] does not keep [[G5083]] My [[G1473]] words. [[G3056]] The [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that [[G3739]] you hear [[G191]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] My own, [[G1699]] but [[G235]] [it is ] from the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] who sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]] 
25 All this [[G3778]] I have spoken [[G2980]] to you [[G4771]] [while] I am still [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] you. [[G4771]] 
26 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Advocate, [[G3875]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] will send [[G3992]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] will teach [[G1321]] you [[G4771]] all things [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] will remind you of [[G5279]] everything [[G3956]] I [[G1473]] have told [[G2036]] you. [[G4771]] 
27 Peace [[G1515]] I leave [[G863]] with you; [[G4771]] My [[G1699]] peace [[G1515]] I give [[G1325]] to you. [[G4771]] I {do} [[G1473]] not [[G3756]] give [[G1325]] to you [[G4771]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] gives. [[G1325]] {Do} not {let} [[G3361]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] be troubled; [[G5015]] {do} not [[G3366]] be afraid. [[G1168]] 
28 You heard [[G191]] Me [[G1473]] say, [[G2036]] ‘I am going away, [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] I am coming [back] [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you.’ [[G4771]] If [[G1487]] you loved [[G25]] Me, [[G1473]] you would rejoice [[G5463]] that [[G3754]] I am going [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] greater than [[G3173]] I. [[G1473]] 
29 And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I have told [[G2046]] you [[G4771]] before [[G4250]] it happens, [[G1096]] so that [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] it does happen, [[G1096]] you will believe. [[G4100]] 
30 I will {not} speak [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] much [[G4183]] [longer], [[G3765]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] of this [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] is coming, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] he has [[G2192]] no claim [[G3756]] on [[G1722]] Me. [[G1473]] 
31 But [[G235]] I do [[G4160]] exactly what [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has commanded [[G1781]] Me, [[G1473]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] may know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] Get up! [[G1453]] Let us go on [[G71]] from here. [[G1782]]
