1 [It was] now [[G1161]] just before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] Passover [[G3957]] Feast, [[G1859]] [and] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] His [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] had come [[G2064]] to [[G2443]] leave [[G3327]] this [[G3778]] world [[G2889]] [and return] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] Having loved [[G25]] [His] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] who [were] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] He loved [[G25]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] [the] very end. [[G5056]] 
2 The evening meal [[G1173]] was underway, [[G1096]] [and] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] {had} already [[G2235]] put [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] of Judas, [[G2455]] [the son] of Simon [[G4613]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] to [[G2443]] betray [[G3860]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
3 [Jesus] knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] had delivered [[G1325]] all things [[G3956]] into [[G1519]] [His] [[G3588]] hands, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] He had come [[G1831]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] was returning [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] God. [[G2316]] 
4 [So] He got up [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] supper, [[G1173]] laid aside [[G5087]] [His] [[G3588]] outer garments, [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] wrapped [[G1241]] a towel [[G3012]] {around} His {waist}. [[G1438]] 
5 After that, [[G1534]] He poured [[G906]] water [[G5204]] into [[G1519]] a basin [[G3537]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to wash [[G3538]] the [[G3588]] disciples’ [[G3101]] feet [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] dry [them] [[G1591]] with the [[G3588]] towel [[G3012]] that [[G3739]] was [[G1510]] around Him. [[G1241]] 
6 He came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter, [[G4074]] who asked [[G3004]] Him, [[G846]] “Lord, [[G2962]] are You going to wash [[G3538]] my [[G1473]] feet?” [[G4228]] 
7 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “You [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3756]] realize [[G1492]] now [[G737]] what [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am doing, [[G4160]] but [[G1161]] later [[G3778]] you will understand.” [[G1097]] 
8 “Never [[G3756]] shall You wash [[G3538]] my [[G1473]] feet!” [[G4228]] Peter [[G4074]] told [[G3004]] Him. [[G846]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “Unless [[G1437]] I wash [[G3538]] you, [[G4771]] you have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] part [[G3313]] with [[G3326]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
9 “[Then,] Lord,” [[G2962]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] replied, [[G3004]] “not [[G3361]] only [[G3440]] my [[G1473]] feet, [[G4228]] but [[G235]] [my] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] [my] [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] as well!” [[G2532]] 
10 Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “Whoever [[G3588]] has already bathed [[G3068]] needs [[G5532]] only [[G1487]] to wash [[G3538]] [his] [[G3588]] feet, [[G4228]] [and] [[G235]] he will be completely [[G3650]] clean. [[G2513]] And [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] clean, [[G2513]] though [[G235]] not [[G3780]] all [of you].” [[G3956]] 
11 For [[G1063]] He knew [[G1492]] who [[G3588]] would betray [[G3860]] Him. [[G846]] That is why [[G1223]] He said, [[G2036]] “Not [[G3780]] all [[G3956]] of you [[G1510]] are clean.” [[G2513]] 
12 When [Jesus] [[G3753]] had washed [[G3538]] their [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] put on [[G2983]] His [[G846]] outer garments, [[G2440]] He reclined with them [[G377]] again [[G3825]] [and] asked, [[G2036]] “Do you know [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] I have done [[G4160]] for you? [[G4771]] 
13 You [[G4771]] call [[G5455]] Me [[G1473]] Teacher [[G1320]] and [[G2532]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] rightly [[G2573]] [so], [[G3004]] because [[G1063]] I am. [[G1510]] 
14 So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] I, [[G1473]] [your] [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Teacher, [[G1320]] have washed [[G3538]] your [[G4771]] feet, [[G4228]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] should [[G3784]] wash [[G3538]] one another’s [[G240]] feet. [[G4228]] 
15 I have set [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] an example [[G5262]] so that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] should do [[G4160]] as [[G2531]] I [[G1473]] have done [[G4160]] for you. [[G4771]] 
16 Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] no [[G3756]] servant [[G1401]] is [[G1510]] greater than [[G3173]] his [[G846]] master, [[G2962]] nor [is] [[G3761]] a messenger [[G652]] greater than [[G3173]] the [one who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] him. [[G846]] 
17 If [[G1487]] you know [[G1492]] these things, [[G3778]] you will be [[G1510]] blessed [[G3107]] if [[G1437]] you do [[G4160]] them. [[G846]] 
18 I am not speaking [[G3004]] about [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] of you; [[G4771]] I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] whom [[G5101]] I have chosen. [[G1586]] But [[G235]] this is to [[G2443]] fulfill [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] Scripture: [[G1124]] ‘The [one who] [[G3588]] eats [[G5176]] bread [[G740]] with Me [[G1473]] has lifted up [[G1869]] his [[G846]] heel [[G4418]] against [[G1909]] Me. [[G1473]] 
19 I am telling [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] now [[G737]] before [[G4253]] it happens, [[G1096]] so that [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] it comes to pass, [[G1096]] you will believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [He]. [[G1510]] 
20 Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whoever [[G3588]] receives [[G2983]] the one [[G5100]] I send [[G3992]] receives [[G2983]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G1161]] whoever [[G3588]] receives [[G2983]] Me [[G1473]] receives [[G2983]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
21 [After] Jesus [[G2424]] had said [[G2036]] [this], [[G3778]] He became troubled [[G5015]] in spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] testified, [[G3140]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] will betray [[G3860]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
22 The [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] began to look [[G991]] at [[G1519]] one another, [[G240]] perplexed [[G639]] as to [[G4012]] which of them [[G5101]] He meant. [[G3004]] 
23 One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] the one whom [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved, [[G25]] was [[G1510]] reclining [[G345]] at [[G1722]] [His] [[G2424]] side. [[G2859]] 
24 So [[G3767]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] motioned [[G3506]] to him [[G3778]] to ask [Jesus] [[G4441]] which one [[G5101]] He was talking [[G3004]] about. [[G4012]] 
25 Leaning [[G377]] back against [[G3779]] Jesus, [[G2424]] he asked, [[G3004]] “Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G5101]] is it?” [[G1510]] 
26 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “It is [[G1510]] the [one] [[G1565]] to whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] give [[G1325]] [this] [[G3588]] piece [of bread] [[G5596]] after I have dipped [it].” [[G911]] Then [[G3767]] He [[G846]] dipped [[G911]] the [[G3588]] piece [of bread] [[G5596]] and [[G2532]] gave [it] [[G1325]] to Judas [[G2455]] [son] of Simon [[G4613]] Iscariot. [[G2469]] 
27 [And when Judas had taken] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] piece [of bread], [[G5596]] Satan [[G4567]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] him. [[G1565]] Then [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to [Judas], [[G846]] “What [[G3739]] you are about to do, [[G4160]] do [[G4160]] quickly.” [[G5032]] 
28 But [[G1161]] no one [[G3762]] [at the table] [[G345]] knew [[G1097]] why [[G4314]] [Jesus] had said [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] to him. [[G846]] 
29 Since [[G1893]] Judas [[G2455]] kept [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] money bag, [[G1101]] some [[G5100]] thought [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] was telling [[G3004]] him [[G846]] to buy [[G59]] what [[G3739]] was [[G2192]] needed [[G5532]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast, [[G1859]] or [[G2228]] to [[G2443]] give [[G1325]] something [[G5100]] to the [[G3588]] poor. [[G4434]] 
30 As soon as he had received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] piece [of bread], [[G5596]] [Judas] [[G1565]] went out [[G1831]] [into the] [[G1510]] night. [[G3571]] 
31 When [[G3753]] [Judas] had gone out, [[G1831]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G3004]] “Now [[G3568]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] is glorified, [[G1392]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] is glorified [[G1392]] in [[G1722]] Him. [[G846]] 
32 If [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] is glorified [[G1392]] in [[G1722]] Him, [[G846]] God [[G2316]] will also glorify [[G1392]] [the Son] [[G846]] in [[G1722]] Himself— [[G848]] and [[G2532]] will glorify [[G1392]] Him [[G846]] at once. [[G2112]] 
33 Little children, [[G5040]] I am [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] only [[G2089]] a little while longer. [[G3398]] You will look for [[G2212]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] I said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] so [[G2532]] now [[G737]] I say [[G3004]] to you: [[G4771]] ‘Where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am going, [[G5217]] you [[G4771]] cannot [[G1410]] come. [[G2064]] 
34 A new [[G2537]] commandment [[G1785]] I give [[G1325]] you: [[G4771]] Love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]] As [[G2531]] I have loved [[G25]] you, [[G4771]] so [[G2443]] also [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] must love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]] 
35 By [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] all [men] [[G3956]] will know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] My [[G1699]] disciples, [[G3101]] if [[G1437]] you love [[G26]] one another.” [[G240]] 
36 “Lord, [[G2962]] where [[G4226]] are You going?” [[G5217]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] asked. [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “Where [[G3699]] I am going, [[G5217]] you cannot [[G1410]] follow [[G190]] Me [[G1473]] now, [[G3568]] but [[G1161]] you will follow [[G190]] later.” [[G5305]] 
37 “Lord,” [[G2962]] said [[G3004]] Peter, [[G4074]] “why [[G1223]] can’t I [[G1410]] follow [[G190]] You [[G4771]] now? [[G737]] I will lay down [[G5087]] my [[G1473]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] You.” [[G4771]] 
38 “Will you lay down [[G5087]] your [[G4771]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] Me?” [[G1473]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G611]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] [before] [[G3756]] [the] rooster [[G220]] crows, [[G5455]] you will deny [[G720]] Me [[G1473]] three times. [[G5151]]
