1 When [[G5613]] Jesus [[G2424]] realized [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] were aware [[G191]] that [[G3754]] [He] [[G2424]] was gaining [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] baptizing [[G907]] more [[G4119]] disciples [[G3101]] than [[G2228]] John [[G2491]] 
2 (although [it was] [[G2544]] not [[G3756]] Jesus [[G2424]] who [[G846]] baptized, [[G907]] but [[G235]] His [[G846]] disciples), [[G3101]] 
3 He left [[G863]] Judea [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] returned [[G565]] to [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]] 
4 Now [[G1161]] He [[G846]] had [[G1163]] to pass [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] Samaria. [[G4540]] 
5 So [[G3767]] He came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] a town [[G4172]] of Samaria [[G4540]] called [[G3004]] Sychar, [[G4965]] near [[G4139]] the [[G3588]] plot of ground [[G5564]] Jacob [[G2384]] had given [[G1325]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] son [[G5207]] Joseph. [[G2501]] 
6 Since [[G1161]] Jacob’s [[G2384]] well [[G4077]] was [[G1510]] there, [[G1563]] Jesus, [[G2424]] weary [[G2872]] from [[G1537]] [His] [[G3588]] journey, [[G3597]] sat down [[G2516]] by [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] well. [[G4077]] It was [[G1510]] about [[G5613]] [the] sixth [[G1623]] hour. [[G5610]] 
7 [When] a Samaritan [[G4540]] woman [[G1135]] came [[G2064]] to draw [[G501]] water, [[G5204]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to her, [[G846]] “Give [[G1325]] Me [[G1473]] a drink.” [[G4095]] 
8 ( [[G1063]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] had gone [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] to [[G2443]] buy [[G59]] food.) [[G5160]] 
9 “You are [[G1510]] a Jew,” [[G2453]] said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] woman. [[G1135]] “How [[G4459]] {can} You [[G4771]] ask for [[G154]] a drink [[G4095]] from [[G3844]] me, [[G1473]] a Samaritan [[G4542]] woman?” [[G1135]] (For [[G1063]] Jews [[G2453]] do not associate [[G4798]] with Samaritans.) [[G4541]] 
10 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “If [[G1487]] you knew [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] asking [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] [for] [[G1325]] a drink, [[G4095]] you [[G4771]] would have asked [[G154]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He would have given [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] living [[G2198]] water. [[G5204]] 
11 “Sir,” [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] replied, [[G3004]] “You have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3777]] to draw with [[G502]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] well [[G5421]] is [[G1510]] deep. [[G901]] Where [[G4159]] then [[G3767]] will You get [[G2192]] [this] [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] water? [[G5204]] 
12 Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] greater than [[G3173]] our [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] Jacob, [[G2384]] who [[G3739]] gave [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] [this] [[G3588]] well [[G5421]] and [[G2532]] drank [[G4095]] from [[G1537]] it [[G846]] himself, [[G846]] [as did] [[G2532]] his [[G846]] sons [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] livestock? [[G2353]] 
13 Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to her, [[G846]] “Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] drinks [[G4095]] this [[G3778]] water [[G5204]] will be thirsty [[G1372]] again. [[G3825]] 
14 But [[G1161]] whoever [[G3739]] drinks [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] I [[G1473]] give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] will never thirst. [[G1372]] Indeed, [[G235]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] I give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] will become [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] a fount [[G4077]] of water [[G5204]] springing up [[G242]] to [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]] 
15 The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] said [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] “Sir, [[G2962]] give [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] this [[G3778]] water [[G5204]] so that [[G2443]] I will not get thirsty [[G1372]] [and] [[G3366]] have to keep coming [[G1330]] here [[G1759]] to draw [water].” [[G501]] 
16 [Jesus] told [[G3004]] her, [[G846]] “Go, [[G5217]] call [[G5455]] your [[G4771]] husband [[G435]] and [[G2532]] come [[G2064]] [back].” [[G1759]] 
17 “I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] husband,” [[G435]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] replied. [[G611]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to her, [[G846]] “You are [[G2036]] correct {to say} [[G2573]] that [[G3754]] you have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] husband. [[G435]] 
18 In fact, [[G1063]] you have had [[G2192]] five [[G4002]] husbands, [[G435]] and [[G2532]] the man [[G3739]] you now have [[G2192]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] your [[G4771]] husband. [[G435]] You have spoken [[G2046]] truthfully.” [[G227]] 
19 “Sir,” [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] said, [[G3004]] “I see [[G2334]] that [[G3754]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] a prophet. [[G4396]] 
20 Our [[G1473]] forefathers [[G3962]] worshiped [[G4352]] on [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] mountain, [[G3735]] but [[G2532]] you [ Jews ] [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] [one] must [[G1163]] worship [[G4352]] is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem.” [[G2414]] 
21 “Believe [[G4100]] Me, [[G1473]] woman,” [[G1135]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G3004]] “a time [[G5610]] is coming [[G2064]] when [[G3753]] you will worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] neither [[G3777]] on [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] mountain [[G3735]] nor [[G3777]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]] 
22 You [[G4771]] worship [[G4352]] what [[G3739]] you do not know; [[G1492]] we [[G1473]] worship [[G4352]] what [[G3739]] we do know, [[G1492]] for [[G3754]] salvation [[G4991]] is [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]] 
23 But [[G235]] a time [[G5610]] is coming [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] {has} now [[G3568]] come [[G1510]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] TRUE [[G228]] worshipers [[G4353]] will worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] in truth, [[G225]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] is seeking [[G2212]] such [[G5108]] as these [[G3588]] to worship [[G4352]] Him. [[G846]] 
24 God [is] [[G2316]] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] [His] [[G3588]] worshipers [[G4352]] must [[G1163]] worship [[G4352]] Him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] [in] truth.” [[G225]] 
25 The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] said, [[G3004]] “I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] Messiah” [[G3323]] ( [[G3588]] called [[G3004]] Christ) [[G5547]] “is coming. [[G2064]] When [[G3752]] He [[G1565]] comes, [[G2064]] He will explain [[G312]] everything [[G537]] to us.” [[G1473]] 
26 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] who [[G3588]] speak [[G2980]] to you [[G4771]] am [He].” [[G1510]] 
27 Just then, [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] returned [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] were astonished [[G2296]] that [[G3754]] He was speaking [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] a woman. [[G1135]] But [[G3305]] no one [[G3762]] asked [Him], [[G2036]] “What [[G5101]] do You want [from her]?” [[G2212]] or, [[G2228]] “Why [[G5101]] are You talking [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] her?” [[G846]] 
28 Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] left [[G863]] her [[G846]] water jar, [[G5201]] went back [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] town, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] said to [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G444]] 
29 “Come, [[G1205]] see [[G3708]] a man [[G444]] who [[G3739]] told [[G2036]] me [[G1473]] everything [[G3956]] I ever did. [[G4160]] Could [[G3385]] this [[G3778]] be [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ?” [[G5547]] 
30 [So] they left [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] made their way [[G2064]] toward [[G4314]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
31 Meanwhile, [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] urged [[G2065]] Him, [[G846]] “Rabbi, [[G4461]] eat [something].” [[G5315]] 
32 But [[G1161]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “I [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] food [[G1035]] to eat [[G5315]] that [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] know [[G1492]] nothing [about].” [[G3756]] 
33 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G2036]] one another, [[G240]] “[Could] [[G3361]] someone [[G5100]] have brought [[G5342]] Him [[G846]] food?” [[G5315]] 
34 Jesus [[G2424]] explained, [[G3004]] “My [[G1699]] food [[G1033]] is [[G1510]] to [[G2443]] do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of Him who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] to finish [[G5048]] His [[G846]] work. [[G2041]] 
35 {Do} you [[G4771]] not [[G3756]] say, [[G3004]] ‘There are [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] four months [[G5072]] [until] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] harvest’? [[G2326]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] lift up [[G1869]] your [[G4771]] eyes [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] look at [[G2300]] the [[G3588]] fields, [[G5561]] for [[G3754]] they are [[G1510]] ripe [[G3022]] for [[G4314]] harvest. [[G2326]] 
36 {Already} the [[G3588]] reaper [[G2325]] draws [[G2983]] [his] wages [[G3408]] and [[G2532]] gathers [[G4863]] a crop [[G2590]] for [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] sower [[G4687]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] reaper [[G2325]] may rejoice [[G5463]] together. [[G3674]] 
37 For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] this case [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G3056]] ‘One [[G243]] sows [[G4687]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] reaps’ [[G2325]] is [[G1510]] true. [[G228]] 
38 I [[G1473]] sent [[G649]] you [[G4771]] to reap [[G2325]] what [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] have not worked for; [[G2872]] others [[G243]] have done the hard work, [[G2872]] and [[G2532]] {now} you [[G4771]] have taken up [[G1525]] their [[G846]] labor.” [[G2873]] 
39 Many [[G4183]] of the [[G3588]] Samaritans [[G4541]] from [[G1537]] that [[G1565]] town [[G4172]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] [Jesus] [[G846]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] woman’s [[G1135]] testimony, [[G3140]] “He told [[G2036]] me [[G1473]] everything [[G3956]] I ever did.” [[G4160]] 
40 So [[G3767]] when [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Samaritans [[G4541]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] they asked [[G2065]] Him [[G846]] to stay [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He stayed [[G3306]] two [[G1417]] days. [[G2250]] 
41 And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] more [[G4119]] believed [[G4100]] because of [[G1223]] His [[G846]] message. [[G3056]] 
42 They said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] “We now believe [[G4100]] not only [[G3765]] because of [[G1223]] your [[G4674]] words; [[G2981]] we have heard [[G191]] for ourselves, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] this [man] [[G3778]] truly [[G230]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Savior [[G4990]] of the [[G3588]] world.” [[G2889]] 
43 After [[G3326]] two [[G1417]] days, [[G2250]] [Jesus] left [[G1831]] for [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]] 
44 Now [[G1063]] [He] [[G2424]] Himself [[G846]] had testified [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] a prophet [[G4396]] has [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] honor [[G5092]] in [[G1722]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] country. [[G3968]] 
45 Yet [[G3767]] when [[G3753]] He arrived, [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] Galileans [[G1057]] welcomed [[G1209]] Him. [[G846]] They had seen [[G3708]] all the great things [[G3956]] He had done [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast, [[G1859]] for [[G1063]] they [[G846]] had gone [[G2064]] [there] [[G1859]] as well. [[G2532]] 
46 So [[G3767]] once again [[G3825]] He came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Cana [[G2580]] in Galilee, [[G1056]] where [[G3699]] He had turned [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] {into} wine. [[G3631]] And [[G2532]] there was [[G1510]] a [[G5100]] royal official [[G937]] whose [[G3739]] son [[G5207]] lay sick [[G770]] at [[G1722]] Capernaum. [[G2584]] 
47 [When] he [[G3778]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] had come [[G2240]] from [[G1537]] Judea [[G2449]] to [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] he went [[G565]] and [[G2532]] begged [[G2065]] Him [[G846]] to [[G2443]] come down [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] heal [[G2390]] his [[G846]] son, [[G5207]] who was about [[G3195]] to die. [[G599]] 
48 Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] “Unless [[G1437]] you people see [[G3708]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders, [[G5059]] you will never believe.” [[G4100]] 
49 “Sir,” [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] official [[G937]] said, [[G3004]] “come down [[G2597]] before [[G4250]] my [[G1473]] child [[G3813]] dies.” [[G599]] 
50 “Go,” [[G4198]] said [[G3004]] Jesus. [[G2424]] “Your [[G4771]] son [[G5207]] will live.” [[G2198]] The [[G3588]] man [[G444]] took [[G4100]] Jesus [[G2424]] at His word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] departed. [[G4198]] 
51 And [[G1161]] while he [[G846]] {was} still [[G2235]] on the way, [[G2597]] his [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] met [[G5221]] him [[G846]] with the news [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] boy [[G3816]] was alive. [[G2198]] 
52 So [[G3767]] he inquired as to [[G4441]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] when [[G3739]] [his son] had recovered, [[G2192]] and [[G3767]] they told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “The [[G3588]] fever [[G4446]] left [[G863]] him [[G846]] yesterday [[G5504]] [at the] seventh [[G1442]] hour.” [[G5610]] 
53 Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] realized [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] this was the very [[G1722]] hour [[G5610]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] had told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “Your [[G4771]] son [[G5207]] will live.” [[G2198]] And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3650]] his [[G846]] household [[G3614]] believed. [[G4100]] 
54 This [was] [[G3778]] now [[G1161]] [the] second [[G1208]] sign [[G4592]] [that] [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] performed [[G4160]] after coming [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] Judea [[G2449]] into [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]]
