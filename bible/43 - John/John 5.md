1 Some time later [[G3326]] there was [[G1510]] a feast [[G1859]] of the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]] 
2 Now [[G1161]] there is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] near [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Sheep Gate [[G4262]] a pool [[G2861]] with [[G2192]] five [[G4002]] covered colonnades, [[G4745]] which [[G3588]] in Aramaic [[G1447]] is called [[G1951]] Bethesda. [[G964]] 
3 On [[G1722]] these [ walkways ] [[G3778]] lay [[G2621]] a great number [[G4128]] of the [[G3588]] sick, [[G770]] [the] blind, [[G5185]] [the] lame, [[G5560]] [and the] paralyzed. [[G3584]] 
4 For [[G1063]] during [[G2596]] [a certain] season [[G2540]] an angel [[G32]] descended [[G2597]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] pool [[G2861]] and [[G2532]] stirred [[G5015]] the [[G3588]] water. [[G5204]] Therefore [[G3767]] he who [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] entered [[G1684]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] stirring [[G5016]] of the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] was made [[G1096]] well [[G5199]] from whatever [[G3739]] disease [[G3553]] he was held by [[G2722]] at the time. [[G1221]] 
5 One [[G5100]] man [[G444]] there [[G1563]] had been [[G2192]] [an] invalid [[G769]] [for] thirty-eight [[G5144]] years. [[G2094]] 
6 When Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] him [[G3778]] lying [there] [[G2621]] and [[G2532]] realized [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] he had spent [[G2192]] a long [[G4183]] time [in this condition], [[G5550]] He asked [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “Do you want [[G2309]] to get [[G1096]] well?” [[G5199]] 
7 “Sir,” [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] invalid [[G770]] replied, [[G611]] “I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] one [[G444]] to help [[G906]] me [[G1473]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] pool [[G2861]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] is stirred. [[G5015]] While [[G1722]] I [[G1473]] am on my way, [[G2064]] someone else [[G243]] goes in [[G2597]] before [[G4253]] me.” [[G1473]] 
8 Then [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “Get up, [[G1453]] pick up [[G142]] your [[G4771]] mat, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] walk.” [[G4043]] 
9 Immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] was made [[G1096]] well, [[G5199]] and [[G2532]] he picked up [[G142]] his [[G846]] mat [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] began to walk. [[G4043]] Now [[G1161]] this happened [[G1510]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] day, [[G2250]] 
10 so [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] said [[G2036]] to the [man] [[G3588]] who had been healed, [[G2323]] “This is [[G1510]] [the] Sabbath! [[G4521]] It is unlawful [[G1832]] for you [[G4771]] to carry [[G142]] your [[G4771]] mat.” [[G2895]] 
11 But [[G1161]] he answered, [[G611]] “The [man who] [[G3588]] made [[G4160]] me [[G1473]] well [[G5199]] told [[G2036]] me, [[G1473]] ‘Pick up [[G142]] your [[G4771]] mat [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] walk.’” [[G4043]] 
12 “Who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] [this] [[G3588]] man [[G444]] who [[G3588]] told [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] to pick [it] up [[G142]] and [[G2532]] walk?” [[G4043]] they asked. [[G2065]] 
13 But [[G1161]] the [man who] [[G3588]] was healed [[G2390]] {did} not [[G3756]] know [[G1492]] who [[G5101]] it was, [[G1510]] for [[G1063]] Jesus [[G2424]] had slipped away [[G1593]] [while the] crowd [[G3793]] was [[G1510]] there. [[G5117]] 
14 Afterward, [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] found [[G2147]] [the man] [[G846]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] “See, [[G2400]] you have been [[G1096]] made well. [[G5199]] Stop [[G3371]] sinning, [[G264]] or [[G2443]] something [[G5100]] worse [[G5501]] may happen [[G1096]] to you. [[G4771]] 
15 [And] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] went away [[G565]] and [[G2532]] told [[G312]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] had made [[G4160]] him [[G846]] well. [[G5199]] 
16 Now [[G2532]] because [[G1223]] [Jesus] was doing [[G4160]] these things [[G3778]] on [[G1722]] [the] Sabbath, [[G4521]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] began to persecute [[G1377]] [Him]. [[G2424]] 
17 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] “To [[G2193]] this very day [[G737]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] is at His work, [[G2038]] and I too [[G2504]] am working.” [[G2038]] 
18 Because of [[G1223]] this, [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] tried [[G2212]] all the harder [[G3123]] to kill [[G615]] Him. [[G846]] Not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] was He breaking [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath, [[G4521]] but [[G235]] He was even calling [[G2036]] God [[G2316]] His own [[G2398]] Father, [[G3962]] making [[G4160]] Himself [[G1438]] equal [[G2470]] with [[G3588]] God. [[G2316]] 
19 So [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] can [[G1410]] do [[G4160]] nothing [[G3762]] by [[G575]] Himself, [[G1438]] unless [[G1437]] He sees [[G991]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] doing [[G4160]] [it]. [[G5100]] For [[G1063]] whatever [[G3739]] [the Father] [[G1565]] does, [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] also [[G2532]] does. [[G4160]] 
20 The [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] loves [[G5368]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] shows [[G1166]] Him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] He [[G846]] does. [[G4160]] And [[G2532]] to [[G2443]] your [[G4771]] amazement, [[G2296]] He will show [[G1166]] Him [[G846]] even greater [[G3173]] works [[G2041]] than these. [[G3778]] 
21 For [[G1063]] just as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] raises [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] gives [them] life, [[G2227]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] gives life [[G2227]] to whom [[G3739]] He wishes. [[G2309]] 
22 Furthermore, [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] judges [[G2919]] no one, [[G3762]] but [[G235]] has assigned [[G1325]] all [[G3956]] judgment [[G2920]] to the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] 
23 so that [[G2443]] all [[G3956]] may honor [[G5091]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] just as [[G2531]] they honor [[G5091]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] Whoever [[G3588]] does not honor [[G5091]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] does not honor [[G5091]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Him. [[G846]] 
24 Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whoever [[G3588]] hears [[G191]] My [[G1473]] word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] believes [[G4100]] Him who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me [[G1473]] has [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] {will} not [[G3756]] come [[G2064]] under [[G1519]] judgment. [[G2920]] Indeed, [[G235]] he has crossed over [[G3327]] from [[G1537]] death [[G2288]] to [[G1519]] life. [[G2222]] 
25 Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] [the] hour [[G5610]] is coming [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] has [[G1510]] now [come] [[G3568]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] will hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] hear [[G191]] will live. [[G2198]] 
26 For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has [[G2192]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] Himself, [[G1438]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] He has granted [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] to have [[G2192]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] Himself. [[G1438]] 
27 And [[G2532]] He has given [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] authority [[G1849]] to execute [[G4160]] judgment, [[G2920]] because [[G3754]] He is [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of Man. [[G444]] 
28 {Do} not [[G3361]] be amazed at [[G2296]] this, [[G3778]] for [[G3754]] [the] hour [[G5610]] is coming [[G2064]] when [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] who [are] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] [their] [[G3588]] graves [[G3419]] will hear [[G191]] His [[G846]] voice [[G5456]] 
29 and [[G2532]] come out— [[G1607]] those [[G3588]] who [[G3588]] have done [[G4160]] good [[G18]] to [[G1519]] [the] resurrection [[G386]] of life, [[G2222]] and [[G1161]] those [[G3588]] who [[G3588]] have done [[G4238]] evil [[G5337]] to [[G1519]] [the] resurrection [[G386]] of judgment. [[G2920]] 
30 I [[G1473]] can [[G1410]] do [[G4160]] nothing [[G3762]] by [[G575]] Myself; [[G1683]] I judge [[G2919]] only as [[G2531]] I hear. [[G191]] And [[G2532]] My [[G1699]] judgment [[G2920]] is [[G1510]] just, [[G1342]] because [[G3754]] I do not seek [[G2212]] My [[G1699]] [own] [[G3588]] will, [[G2307]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [Him who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]] 
31 If [[G1437]] I [[G1473]] testify [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Myself, [[G1683]] My [[G1473]] testimony [[G3141]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] valid. [[G227]] 
32 There is [[G1510]] another [[G243]] who [[G3588]] testifies [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [His] [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] about [[G4012]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] valid. [[G227]] 
33 You [[G4771]] have sent [[G649]] to [[G4314]] John [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] he has testified [[G3140]] to the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] 
34 [Even though] [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] {do} not [[G3756]] accept [[G2983]] human [[G444]] testimony, [[G3141]] I say [[G3004]] these things [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] may be saved. [[G4982]] 
35 [John] [[G1565]] was [[G1510]] a [[G3588]] lamp [[G3088]] that [[G3588]] burned [[G2545]] and [[G2532]] gave light, [[G5316]] and [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] were willing [[G2309]] for [[G4314]] a season [[G5610]] to bask [[G21]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] light. [[G5457]] 
36 But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] testimony [[G3141]] more substantial than [[G3173]] that [[G3588]] of John. [[G2491]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] that [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has given [[G1325]] Me [[G1473]] to accomplish— [[G5048]] the [[G3588]] very [[G846]] works [[G2041]] I am doing— [[G4160]] testify [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Me [[G1473]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has sent [[G649]] Me. [[G1473]] 
37 And [[G2532]] [the] Father [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me [[G1473]] has Himself testified [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Me. [[G1473]] You have never heard [[G191]] His [[G846]] voice [[G5456]] nor [[G3777]] seen [[G3708]] His [[G846]] form, [[G1491]] 
38 [nor] [[G2532]] [does] [[G2192]] His [[G846]] word [[G3056]] abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] because [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3756]] believe [[G4100]] the [One] [[G3778]] He [[G1565]] sent. [[G649]] 
39 You pore over [[G2045]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures [[G1124]] because [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] presume that [[G1380]] by [[G1722]] them [[G846]] you possess [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]] These [[G1565]] are [[G1510]] the [very words that] [[G3588]] testify [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Me, [[G1473]] 
40 yet [[G2532]] you refuse [[G2309]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me [[G1473]] to [[G2443]] have [[G2192]] life. [[G2222]] 
41 I do not accept [[G2983]] glory [[G1391]] from [[G3844]] men, [[G444]] 
42 but [[G235]] I know [[G1097]] you, [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] you do not have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of God [[G2316]] within [[G1722]] you. [[G1438]] 
43 I [[G1473]] have come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] Father’s [[G3962]] name, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] you have not received [[G2983]] Me; [[G1473]] [but] if [[G1437]] someone else [[G243]] comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] name, [[G3686]] you will receive [[G2983]] him. [[G1565]] 
44 How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] you [[G4771]] believe [[G4100]] if you accept [[G2983]] glory [[G1391]] from [[G3844]] one another, [[G240]] yet [[G2532]] do not seek [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] that [comes] [[G3588]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] only [[G3441]] God? [[G2316]] 
45 Do not think [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] will accuse [[G2723]] you [[G4771]] before [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] Your [[G4771]] accuser [[G2723]] is [[G1510]] Moses, [[G3475]] in [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] have put your hope. [[G1679]] 
46 If [[G1487]] you had believed [[G4100]] Moses, [[G3475]] you would believe [[G4100]] Me, [[G1473]] because [[G1063]] he [[G1565]] wrote [[G1125]] about [[G4012]] Me. [[G1473]] 
47 But [[G1161]] since [[G1487]] you do not believe [[G4100]] what [[G3588]] he [[G1565]] wrote, [[G1121]] how [[G4459]] will you believe [[G4100]] what [[G3588]] I [[G1699]] say?” [[G4487]]
