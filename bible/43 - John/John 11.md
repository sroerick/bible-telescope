1 At this time [[G1161]] a [man] [[G5100]] [named] Lazarus [[G2976]] was [[G1510]] sick. [[G770]] [He lived in] [[G575]] Bethany, [[G963]] the [[G3588]] village [[G2968]] of Mary [[G3137]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] sister [[G79]] Martha. [[G3136]] 
2 ( [[G1161]] Mary, [[G3137]] whose [[G3739]] brother [[G80]] Lazarus [[G2976]] was sick, [[G770]] would [later] [[G1510]] anoint [[G218]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] with perfume [[G3464]] and [[G2532]] wipe [[G1591]] His [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] with [[G3588]] her [[G846]] hair.) [[G2359]] 
3 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] sisters [[G79]] sent [[G649]] word [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus], [[G846]] “Lord, [[G2962]] the [one] [[G3739]] You love [[G5368]] is sick.” [[G770]] 
4 [When] [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [this], [[G191]] He said, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] sickness [[G769]] will [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] end in [[G4314]] death. [[G2288]] No, [[G235]] [it is] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of God, [[G2316]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] may be glorified [[G1392]] through [[G1223]] it. [[G846]] 
5 Now [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved [[G25]] Martha [[G3136]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] sister [[G79]] and [[G2532]] Lazarus. [[G2976]] 
6 So [[G3767]] on [[G5613]] hearing [[G191]] that [[G3754]] [Lazarus] was sick, [[G770]] He stayed [[G3306]] where [[G3739]] He was [[G1510]] for two [[G1417]] days, [[G2250]] 
7 and then [[G1899]] He said [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] “Let us go [[G71]] back [[G3825]] to [[G1519]] Judea.” [[G2449]] 
8 “Rabbi,” [[G4461]] [they] [[G3101]] replied, [[G3004]] “the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] just [[G3568]] tried [[G2212]] to stone [[G3034]] You, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] You are going [[G5217]] back [[G3825]] there?” [[G1563]] 
9 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “Are there [[G1510]] not [[G3780]] twelve [[G1427]] hours [[G5610]] of [[G3588]] daylight? [[G2250]] If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] walks [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] daytime, [[G2250]] he will not stumble, [[G4350]] because [[G3754]] he sees [[G991]] by the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] of this [[G3778]] world. [[G2889]] 
10 But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] walks [[G4043]] at [[G1722]] night, [[G3571]] he will stumble, [[G4350]] because [[G3754]] he [[G846]] has [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] light.” [[G5457]] 
11 After [[G3326]] He had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] He told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Our [[G1473]] friend [[G5384]] Lazarus [[G2976]] has fallen asleep, [[G2837]] but [[G235]] I am going [there] [[G4198]] to [[G2443]] wake him up.” [[G1852]] 
12 His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] replied, [[G2036]] “Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] he is sleeping, [[G2837]] he will get better.” [[G4982]] 
13 They [[G1565]] thought [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] was talking [[G3004]] about [[G4012]] actual sleep, [[G2838]] but [[G1161]] [He] [[G2424]] was speaking [[G2046]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] death [[G2288]] of [Lazarus]. [[G846]] 
14 So [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] plainly, [[G3954]] “Lazarus [[G2976]] is dead, [[G599]] 
15 and [[G2532]] for your sake [[G1223]] I am glad [[G5463]] I was [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] there, [[G1563]] so that [[G2443]] you may believe. [[G4100]] But [[G235]] let us go [[G71]] to [[G4314]] him.” [[G846]] 
16 Then [[G3767]] Thomas [[G2381]] called [[G3004]] Didymus [[G1324]] said [[G2036]] to [his] [[G3588]] fellow disciples, [[G4827]] “{Let} us [[G1473]] also [[G2532]] go, [[G71]] so that [[G2443]] we may die [[G599]] with [[G3326]] Him.” [[G846]] 
17 [When] [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] arrived, [[G2064]] He found that [[G2147]] [Lazarus] [[G846]] had already spent [[G2192]] four [[G5064]] days [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tomb. [[G3419]] 
18 Now [[G1161]] Bethany [[G963]] was [[G1510]] near [[G1451]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] a little less than [[G5613]] two miles [[G1178]] away, [[G575]] 
19 and [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] had come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Martha [[G3136]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] to [[G2443]] console [[G3888]] them [[G846]] in the loss of [[G4012]] [their] [[G3588]] brother. [[G80]] 
20 So [[G3767]] when [[G5613]] Martha [[G3136]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] was coming, [[G2064]] she went out to meet [[G5221]] Him; [[G846]] but [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] stayed [[G2516]] at [[G1722]] home. [[G3624]] 
21 Martha [[G3136]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] “Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] You had been [[G1510]] here, [[G5602]] my [[G1473]] brother [[G80]] would not have died. [[G599]] 
22 But [[G235]] even now [[G3568]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] will give [[G1325]] You [[G4771]] whatever [[G3745]] You ask [[G154]] [Him].” [[G2316]] 
23 “Your [[G4771]] brother [[G80]] will rise again,” [[G450]] Jesus [[G2424]] told her. [[G3004]] 
24 Martha [[G3136]] replied, [[G3004]] “I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he will rise again [[G450]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day.” [[G2250]] 
25 Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to her, [[G846]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] life. [[G2222]] He who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me [[G1473]] will live, [[G2198]] even though [[G2579]] he dies. [[G599]] 
26 And [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] lives [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me [[G1473]] will never die. [[G599]] Do you believe [[G4100]] this?” [[G3778]] 
27 “Yes, [[G3483]] Lord,” [[G2962]] she answered, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] was to come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world.” [[G2889]] 
28 [After] [[G2532]] [Martha] had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] she went back [[G565]] and [[G2532]] called [[G5455]] her [[G846]] sister [[G79]] Mary [[G3137]] aside [[G2977]] to tell her, [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] Teacher [[G1320]] is here [[G3918]] and [[G2532]] is asking for [[G5455]] you.” [[G4771]] 
29 And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] [Mary] heard this, [[G191]] she [[G1565]] got up [[G1453]] quickly [[G5035]] and [[G2532]] went [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him. [[G846]] 
30 Now [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] {had} not yet [[G3768]] entered [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] village, [[G2968]] but [[G235]] was [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] Martha [[G3136]] had met [[G5221]] Him. [[G846]] 
31 [When] [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] who [[G3588]] were [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] consoling [[G3888]] [Mary] [[G846]] saw [[G3708]] how quickly [[G5030]] [she] [[G3137]] got up [[G450]] and [[G2532]] went out, [[G1831]] they followed [[G190]] her, [[G846]] supposing [[G1380]] she was going [[G5217]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] to [[G2443]] mourn [[G2799]] there. [[G1563]] 
32 When [[G5613]] Mary [[G3137]] came to [[G2064]] Jesus [[G2424]] [and] saw [[G3708]] Him, [[G846]] she fell [[G4098]] at [[G4314]] His [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] You had been [[G1510]] here, [[G5602]] my [[G1473]] brother [[G80]] {would} [[G302]] not [[G3756]] have died.” [[G599]] 
33 When [[G5613]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] her [[G846]] weeping, [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] who had come with [[G4905]] her [[G846]] {also} weeping, [[G2799]] He was deeply moved [[G1690]] in spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] troubled. [[G5015]] 
34 “Where [[G4226]] have you laid [[G5087]] him?” [[G846]] He asked. [[G2036]] “Come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see, [[G2400]] Lord,” [[G2962]] they answered. [[G3004]] 
35 Jesus [[G2424]] wept. [[G1145]] 
36 Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] said, [[G2036]] “See [[G2400]] how [[G4459]] He loved [[G5368]] him!” [[G846]] 
37 But [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] asked, [[G2036]] “Could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] this [man] [[G3778]] who [[G3588]] opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] of the [[G3588]] blind [[G5185]] also [[G2532]] have kept [[G4160]] [Lazarus] [[G3778]] from dying?” [[G599]] 
38 Jesus, [[G2424]] once again [[G3825]] deeply moved, [[G1690]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] tomb. [[G3419]] It was [[G1510]] a cave [[G4693]] [with] [[G2532]] a stone [[G3037]] laid [[G1945]] across [[G1909]] [the entrance]. [[G846]] 
39 “Take away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] stone,” [[G3037]] Jesus [[G2424]] said. [[G3004]] “Lord, [[G2962]] by now [[G2235]] he stinks,” [[G3605]] said [[G3004]] Martha, [[G3136]] the [[G3588]] sister [[G79]] of the [[G3588]] dead [man]. [[G5053]] “It has already been [[G1510]] four days.” [[G5066]] 
40 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G3004]] “Did I not tell [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] you believed, [[G4100]] you would see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of God?” [[G2316]] 
41 So [[G3767]] they took away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] stone. [[G3037]] Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] lifted [[G142]] His [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] upward [[G507]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “Father, [[G3962]] I thank [[G2168]] You [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] You have heard [[G191]] Me. [[G1473]] 
42 I [[G1473]] knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] You always hear [[G191]] Me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] I say [this] [[G2036]] for the benefit of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] standing [here], [[G4026]] so [[G2443]] they may believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] You [[G4771]] sent [[G649]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
43 [After Jesus] had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] He called out [[G2905]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] “Lazarus, [[G2976]] come [[G1204]] out!” [[G1854]] 
44 The [man who] [[G3588]] had been dead [[G2348]] came out [[G1831]] [with his] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] feet [[G4228]] bound [[G1210]] in strips of linen, [[G2750]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] face [[G3799]] wrapped [[G4019]] in a headcloth. [[G4676]] “Unwrap [[G3089]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] let [[G863]] him [[G846]] go,” [[G5217]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G3004]] them. [[G846]] 
45 Therefore [[G3767]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] who [[G3588]] had come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Mary, [[G3137]] and [[G2532]] had seen [[G2300]] what [[G3739]] [Jesus] did, [[G4160]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him. [[G846]] 
46 But [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] went [[G565]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] what [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] had done. [[G4160]] 
47 Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] convened [[G4863]] the Sanhedrin [[G4892]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “What [[G5101]] are we to do? [[G4160]] This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] is performing [[G4160]] many [[G4183]] signs. [[G4592]] 
48 If [[G1437]] we let [[G863]] Him [[G846]] go on like this, [[G3779]] everyone [[G3956]] will believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him, [[G846]] and then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Romans [[G4514]] will come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] take away [[G142]] both [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] place [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] [our] [[G3588]] nation.” [[G1484]] 
49 But [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] [named] Caiaphas, [[G2533]] who was [[G1510]] high priest [[G749]] that [[G1565]] year, [[G1763]] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] know [[G1492]] nothing at all! [[G3762]] 
50 You do not realize [[G3049]] that [[G3754]] it is better [[G4851]] for you [[G4771]] that [[G2443]] one [[G1520]] man [[G444]] die [[G599]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] [than that] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] nation [[G1484]] perish.” [[G622]] 
51 [Caiaphas] did not say [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] on [[G575]] his own. [[G1438]] Instead, [[G235]] [as] [[G1510]] high priest [[G749]] that [[G1565]] year, [[G1763]] he was prophesying [[G4395]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] would [[G3195]] die [[G599]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] nation, [[G1484]] 
52 and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] nation, [[G1484]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] [for] [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] scattered [[G1287]] children [[G5043]] of God, [[G2316]] to gather [them] together [[G4863]] into [[G1519]] one. [[G1520]] 
53 So [[G3767]] from [[G575]] that [[G1565]] day {on} [[G2250]] they plotted [[G1011]] to [[G2443]] kill [[G615]] Him. [[G846]] 
54 As a result, [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] no longer [[G3765]] went about [[G4043]] publicly [[G3954]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] but [[G235]] He withdrew [[G565]] to [[G1519]] a town [[G4172]] called [[G3004]] Ephraim [[G2187]] in [[G1519]] an area [[G5561]] near [[G1451]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]] [And] He stayed [[G3306]] there [[G2546]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] disciples. [[G3101]] 
55 Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] Passover [[G3957]] was [[G1510]] near, [[G1451]] and [[G2532]] many [people] [[G4183]] went up [[G305]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] country [[G5561]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] to [[G2443]] purify [[G48]] themselves [[G1438]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] Passover. [[G3957]] 
56 They kept looking for [[G2212]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] asking [[G2036]] one another [[G240]] [as] they stood [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] “What [[G5101]] do you think? [[G1380]] Will He come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] at all?” [[G3756]] 
57 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] had given [[G1325]] orders [[G1785]] that [[G2443]] anyone [who] [[G5100]] knew [[G1097]] where [[G4226]] He was [[G1510]] must report [it], [[G3377]] so that [[G3704]] they could arrest [[G4084]] Him. [[G846]]
