# John 18
[[John 17|←]] • [[John 19|→]]
1 [When] Jesus [[G2424]] had spoken [[G2036]] these [words], [[G3778]] [He] went out [[G1831]] with [[G4862]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] across [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] Kidron [[G2748]] Valley, [[G5493]] where [[G3699]] [they] [[G3101]] entered [[G1525]] a garden. [[G2779]] 
2 Now [[G1161]] Judas, [[G2455]] His [[G846]] betrayer, [[G3860]] also [[G2532]] knew [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] place, [[G5117]] because [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] {had} often [[G4178]] met [[G4863]] there [[G1563]] with [[G3326]] His [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]] 
3 So [[G3767]] Judas [[G2455]] brought [[G2983]] a band of soldiers [[G4686]] and [[G2532]] officers [[G5257]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees. [[G5330]] They arrived [[G2064]] [at the garden] [[G1563]] [carrying] [[G3326]] lanterns, [[G5322]] torches, [[G2985]] and [[G2532]] weapons. [[G3696]] 
4 Jesus, [[G2424]] knowing [[G1492]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] was coming [[G2064]] upon [[G1909]] Him, [[G846]] stepped forward [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] asked [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Whom [[G5101]] are you seeking?” [[G2212]] 
5 “Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth,” [[G3480]] they answered. [[G611]] [Jesus] said, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] am [He].” [[G1510]] And [[G1161]] Judas, [[G2455]] His [[G846]] betrayer, [[G3860]] was standing [there] [[G2476]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]] 
6 When [[G5613]] [Jesus] said, [[G2036]] “I [[G1473]] am [He],” [[G1510]] they drew [[G565]] back [[G3694]] and [[G2532]] fell [[G4098]] to [the] ground. [[G5476]] 
7 So [[G3767]] He asked [[G1905]] them [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] “Whom [[G5101]] are you seeking?” [[G2212]] “Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth,” [[G3480]] they answered. [[G2036]] 
8 “I told [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [He],” [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G611]] “So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] you are looking for [[G2212]] Me, [[G1473]] let [[G863]] these [men] [[G3778]] go.” [[G5217]] 
9 This was [[G2443]] to fulfill [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] He had spoken: [[G2036]] “I have not lost one [[G622]] of [[G1537]] those [[G3739]] You have given [[G1325]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
10 Then [[G3767]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] drew [[G1670]] [his] [[G2192]] sword [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] struck [[G3817]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] of the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] cutting off [[G609]] his [[G846]] right [[G1188]] ear. [[G5621]] The [[G3588]] servant’s [[G1401]] name [[G3686]] was [[G1510]] Malchus. [[G3124]] 
11 “Put [[G906]] [your] [[G3588]] sword [[G3162]] back in [[G1519]] [its] [[G3588]] sheath!” [[G2336]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] Peter. [[G4074]] “Shall I not drink [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has given [[G1325]] Me?” [[G1473]] 
12 Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] band of soldiers, [[G4686]] [with] [[G2532]] [its] [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] of the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] arrested [[G4815]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] bound [[G1210]] Him. [[G846]] 
13 They brought [Him] first [[G71]] to [[G4314]] Annas, [[G452]] who was [[G1510]] [the] father-in-law [[G3995]] of Caiaphas, [[G2533]] [the] high priest [[G749]] [that] [[G1565]] year. [[G1763]] 
14 Caiaphas [[G2533]] was [[G1510]] the [one] [[G3588]] who had advised [[G4823]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] that [[G3754]] it would be better if [[G4851]] one [[G1520]] man [[G444]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]] 
15 Now [[G1161]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] disciple [[G3101]] were following [[G190]] Jesus. [[G2424]] Since [[G3588]] that [[G1565]] disciple [[G3101]] was [[G1510]] known [[G1110]] to the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] he also went [[G4897]] with Jesus [[G2424]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] courtyard [[G833]] of the [[G3588]] high priest. [[G749]] 
16 But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] stood [[G2476]] outside [[G1854]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] door. [[G2374]] Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] disciple [[G3101]] who was [[G3588]] known [[G1110]] to the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] went out [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] spoke [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] doorkeeper, [[G2377]] and [[G2532]] brought [[G1521]] Peter [in]. [[G4074]] 
17 At this, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] servant girl [[G3814]] watching the door [[G2377]] said [[G3004]] to Peter, [[G4074]] “Aren’t [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] [one] of [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] man’s [[G444]] disciples?” [[G3101]] “I am [[G1510]] not,” [[G3756]] he [[G1565]] answered. [[G3004]] 
18 Because [[G3754]] it was [[G1510]] cold, [[G5592]] the [[G3588]] servants [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] officers [[G5257]] were standing around [[G2476]] a charcoal fire [[G439]] they had made [[G4160]] to keep warm. [[G2328]] And [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] was [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] standing [[G2476]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] warming himself. [[G2328]] 
19 Meanwhile, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] questioned [[G2065]] Jesus [[G2424]] about [[G4012]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] teaching. [[G1322]] 
20 “I [[G1473]] have spoken [[G2980]] openly [[G3954]] to the [[G3588]] world,” [[G2889]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered. [[G611]] “I [[G1473]] always [[G3842]] taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] [the] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] where [[G3699]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] come together. [[G4905]] I said [[G2980]] nothing [[G3762]] in [[G1722]] secret. [[G2927]] 
21 Why [[G5101]] are you asking [[G2065]] Me? [[G1473]] Ask [[G2065]] those who [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] My message. [[G2980]] Surely [[G2400]] they [[G3778]] know [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] said.” [[G2036]] 
22 [When] [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] had said [[G2036]] [this], [[G3778]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] standing nearby [[G3936]] slapped [Him] in the face [[G4475]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “{Is} this how [[G3779]] You answer [[G611]] the [[G3588]] high priest?” [[G749]] 
23 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “If [[G1487]] I said [[G2980]] [something] wrong, [[G2560]] testify [[G3140]] to [[G4012]] what [[G3588]] was wrong. [[G2556]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] [I spoke] correctly, [[G2573]] why [[G5101]] did you strike [[G1194]] Me?” [[G1473]] 
24 Then [[G3767]] Annas [[G452]] sent [[G649]] Him, [[G846]] [ still ] bound, [[G1210]] to [[G4314]] Caiaphas [[G2533]] the [[G3588]] high priest. [[G749]] 
25 Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] was [[G1510]] still [[G1161]] standing [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] warming himself. [[G2328]] So [[G3767]] they asked [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “Aren’t [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] [one] of [[G1537]] His [[G846]] disciples?” [[G3101]] He [[G1565]] denied [it] [[G720]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “I am [[G1510]] not.” [[G3756]] 
26 One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] high priest’s [[G749]] servants, [[G1401]] a relative [[G4773]] of [the man] whose [[G3739]] ear [[G5621]] Peter [[G4074]] had cut off, [[G609]] asked, [[G3004]] “Didn’t [[G3756]] I [[G1473]] see [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] with [[G3326]] Him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] garden?” [[G2779]] 
27 Peter [[G4074]] denied [it] [[G720]] once more, [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] a rooster [[G220]] crowed. [[G5455]] 
28 Then [[G3767]] they led [[G71]] Jesus [[G2424]] away from [[G575]] Caiaphas [[G2533]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Praetorium. [[G4232]] By now [[G1161]] it was [[G1510]] early morning, [[G4404]] and [[G2532]] [the Jews] [[G846]] {did} not [[G3756]] enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] Praetorium [[G4232]] to [[G2443]] avoid [[G3361]] being defiled [[G3392]] [and unable] [[G235]] to eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] Passover. [[G3957]] 
29 So [[G3767]] Pilate [[G4091]] went [[G1831]] out [[G1854]] to [[G4314]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] asked, [[G5346]] “What [[G5101]] accusation [[G2724]] are you bringing [[G5342]] against [[G2596]] this [[G3778]] man?” [[G444]] 
30 “If [[G1487]] He [[G3778]] were [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] a criminal,” [[G2556]] they replied, [[G611]] “we would not have handed Him over [[G3860]] to you.” [[G4771]] 
31 “You take [[G2983]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] judge [[G2919]] Him [[G846]] by [[G2596]] your [[G4771]] [own] [[G3588]] law,” [[G3551]] Pilate [[G4091]] told [[G2036]] them. [[G846]] “We are not permitted [[G1832]] to execute anyone,” [[G615]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] replied. [[G2036]] 
32 This [[G2443]] was to fulfill [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] had spoken [[G2036]] to indicate [[G4591]] the kind of [[G4169]] death [[G2288]] He was going [[G3195]] to die. [[G599]] 
33 Pilate [[G4091]] went [[G1525]] back [[G3825]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Praetorium, [[G4232]] summoned [[G5455]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] asked [[G2036]] Him, [[G846]] “Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews?” [[G2453]] 
34 “{Are} you [[G4771]] saying [[G3004]] this [[G3778]] on [[G575]] your own,” [[G4572]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked, [[G611]] “or [[G2228]] {did} others [[G243]] tell [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] about [[G4012]] Me?” [[G1473]] 
35 “Am [[G1510]] I [[G1473]] a Jew?” [[G2453]] Pilate [[G4091]] replied. [[G611]] “Your [[G4674]] [own] [[G3588]] people [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] chief priests [[G749]] handed [[G3860]] You [[G4771]] {over} to me. [[G1473]] What [[G5101]] have You done?” [[G4160]] 
36 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “My [[G1699]] kingdom [[G932]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] world; [[G2889]] if [[G1487]] [it] [[G932]] were, [[G1510]] My [[G1699]] servants [[G5257]] would fight [[G75]] to [[G2443]] prevent My arrest [[G3860]] by the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]] But [[G1161]] now, [[G3568]] My [[G1699]] kingdom [[G932]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of this realm. [[G1782]] 
37 “Then [[G3766]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] a king!” [[G935]] Pilate [[G4091]] said. [[G2036]] “You [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] a king,” [[G935]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered. [[G611]] “For [[G1519]] this reason [[G3778]] I was born [[G1080]] and [[G2532]] have come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] to [[G2443]] testify [[G3140]] to the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] belongs to [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] listens to [[G191]] My [[G1473]] voice.” [[G5456]] 
38 “What [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] truth?” [[G225]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked. [[G3004]] And [[G2532]] having said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] he went out [[G1831]] again [[G3825]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “I [[G1473]] find [[G2147]] no [[G3762]] basis for a charge [[G156]] against [[G1722]] Him. [[G846]] 
39 But [[G1161]] it is [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] custom [[G4914]] that [[G2443]] I release [[G630]] to you [[G4771]] one [prisoner] [[G1520]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Passover. [[G3957]] So then, [[G3767]] do you want [[G1014]] me to release [[G630]] to you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews?” [[G2453]] 
40 “Not [[G3361]] this [man],” [[G3778]] they shouted, [[G2905]] “but [[G235]] Barabbas!” [[G912]] (Now [[G1161]] Barabbas [[G912]] was [[G1510]] an insurrectionist.) [[G3027]]
