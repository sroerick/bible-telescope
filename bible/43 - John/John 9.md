1 Now as [[G2532]] [Jesus] was passing by, [[G3855]] He saw [[G3708]] a man [[G444]] blind [[G5185]] from [[G1537]] birth, [[G1079]] 
2 and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G2065]] Him, [[G846]] “Rabbi, [[G4461]] who [[G5101]] sinned, [[G264]] this [man] [[G3778]] or [[G2228]] his [[G846]] parents, [[G1118]] that [[G2443]] he was born [[G1080]] blind?” [[G5185]] 
3 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “Neither [[G3777]] this [man] [[G3778]] nor [[G3777]] his [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] sinned, [[G264]] but [[G235]] [this happened] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of God [[G2316]] would be displayed [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]] 
4 While [[G2193]] it is [[G1510]] daytime, [[G2250]] we [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] do [[G2038]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of Him who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]] Night [[G3571]] is coming, [[G2064]] when [[G3753]] no one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] work. [[G2038]] 
5 While [[G3752]] I am [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] I am [[G1510]] [the] light [[G5457]] of the [[G3588]] world.” [[G2889]] 
6 When [Jesus] had said [[G2036]] [this], [[G3778]] He spat [[G4429]] on [the] ground, [[G5476]] made [[G4160]] [some] mud, [[G4081]] and [[G2532]] applied [[G2025]] [it] [[G4081]] to [[G1909]] [the man’s] [[G846]] eyes. [[G3788]] 
7 Then [[G2532]] He told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “Go, [[G5217]] wash [[G3538]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] pool [[G2861]] of Siloam” [[G4611]] (which [[G3739]] means [[G2059]] Sent). [[G649]] So [[G3767]] [the man] went [[G565]] and [[G2532]] washed, [[G3538]] and [[G2532]] came [back] [[G2064]] seeing. [[G991]] 
8 At this, [[G3767]] [his] [[G3588]] neighbors [[G1069]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] had formerly seen [[G2334]] him [[G846]] begging [[G4319]] began to ask, [[G2036]] “Isn’t [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] the [man who] [[G3588]] used to sit [[G2521]] and [[G2532]] beg?” [[G4319]] 
9 Some [[G243]] claimed [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] he [[G3778]] was, [[G1510]] but others [[G243]] said, [[G2036]] “No, [[G3780]] he just looks [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] him.” [[G846]] [But the man] [[G1565]] kept saying, [[G2036]] “I [[G1473]] am [the one].” [[G1510]] 
10 “How [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] {were} your [[G4771]] eyes [[G3788]] opened?” [[G455]] they asked. [[G2036]] 
11 He [[G1565]] answered, [[G611]] “The [[G3588]] man [[G444]] they call [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] made [[G4160]] [some] mud [[G4081]] and [[G2532]] anointed [[G2025]] my [[G1473]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] He told [[G2036]] me [[G1473]] to [[G3754]] go [[G5217]] to [[G1519]] Siloam [[G4611]] and [[G2532]] wash. [[G3538]] So [[G3767]] I went [[G565]] and [[G2532]] washed [[G3538]] [and] received my sight. [[G308]] 
12 “Where [[G4226]] is [[G1510]] He?” [[G1565]] they asked. [[G2036]] “I do not know,” [[G1492]] he answered. [[G3004]] 
13 They brought [[G71]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] [the man] [[G846]] who [[G3588]] had been [[G4218]] blind. [[G5185]] 
14 Now [[G1161]] [the] day [[G2250]] on [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] had made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] mud [[G4081]] and [[G2532]] opened [[G455]] his [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] was [[G1510]] a Sabbath. [[G4521]] 
15 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] also [[G2532]] asked [[G2065]] him [[G846]] how [[G4459]] he had received his sight. [[G308]] [The man] answered, [[G2036]] “He put [[G2007]] mud [[G4081]] on [[G1909]] my [[G1473]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] I washed, [[G3538]] and [now] [[G2532]] I can see.” [[G991]] 
16 Because of this, [[G3767]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] said, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] from [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] for [[G3754]] He does not keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath.” [[G4521]] But [[G1161]] others [[G243]] said, [[G2036]] “How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] a sinful [[G268]] man [[G444]] perform [[G4160]] such [[G5108]] signs?” [[G4592]] And [[G2532]] there was [[G1510]] division [[G4978]] among [[G1722]] them. [[G846]] 
17 So [[G3767]] once again [[G3825]] they asked [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] [man who had been] blind, [[G5185]] “What [[G5101]] {do} you [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] about [[G4012]] Him, [[G846]] since [[G3754]] [it was] your [[G4771]] eyes [[G3788]] He opened?” [[G455]] “He is [[G1510]] a prophet,” [[G4396]] [the man] replied. [[G2036]] 
18 The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] still [[G3767]] {did} not [[G3756]] believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] [the man] had been [[G1510]] blind [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] had received his sight [[G308]] until [[G2193]] they summoned [[G5455]] [his] [[G308]] parents [[G1118]] 
19 and [[G2532]] asked, [[G2065]] “Is [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] your [[G4771]] son, [[G5207]] [the one] [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] was born [[G1080]] blind? [[G5185]] So [[G3767]] how [is it that] [[G4459]] he can now see?” [[G991]] 
20 His [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] answered, [[G611]] “We know [[G1492]] he [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] our [[G1473]] son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] [we know] [[G3754]] he was born [[G1080]] blind. [[G5185]] 
21 But [[G1161]] how [[G4459]] he can now see [[G991]] or [[G2228]] who [[G5101]] opened [[G455]] his [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] we [[G1473]] {do} not [[G3756]] know. [[G1492]] Ask [[G2065]] him. [[G846]] He [[G846]] is [[G2192]] old enough [[G2244]] to speak [[G2980]] for [[G4012]] himself.” [[G1438]] 
22 His [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] said [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] because [[G3754]] they were afraid [[G5399]] of the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] had already determined [[G4934]] that [[G2443]] anyone who [[G5100]] confessed [[G3670]] [Jesus] [[G846]] [as the] Christ [[G5547]] would be [[G1096]] put out of the synagogue. [[G656]] 
23 That was why [[G1223]] his [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] said, [[G2036]] “He is [[G2192]] old enough. [[G2244]] Ask [[G1905]] him.” [[G846]] 
24 So [[G3767]] a second time [[G1208]] they called [[G5455]] for [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] who [[G3739]] had been [[G1510]] blind [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “Give [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] to God! [[G2316]] We [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] is [[G1510]] a sinner.” [[G268]] 
25 He [[G1565]] answered, [[G611]] “Whether [[G1487]] He is [[G1510]] a sinner [[G268]] I do not know. [[G1492]] [There is] one [thing] [[G1520]] I do know: [[G1492]] I was [[G1510]] blind, [[G5185]] [but] now [[G737]] I see!” [[G991]] 
26 “What [[G5101]] did He do [[G4160]] to you?” [[G4771]] they asked. [[G2036]] “How [[G4459]] did He open [[G455]] your [[G4771]] eyes?” [[G3788]] 
27 He replied, [[G611]] “I already told [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you did not listen. [[G191]] Why [[G5101]] do you want [[G2309]] to hear [it] [[G191]] again? [[G3825]] {Do} you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] want [[G2309]] to become [[G1096]] His [[G846]] disciples?” [[G3101]] 
28 Then [[G2532]] they heaped insults on [[G3058]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] His [[G1565]] disciple; [[G3101]] we [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] disciples [[G3101]] of Moses. [[G3475]] 
29 We [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] spoke [[G2980]] to Moses, [[G3475]] but [[G1161]] we do not know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] this [man] [[G3778]] is {from}.” [[G1510]] 
30 “That [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] remarkable [[G2298]] indeed!” [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] said. [[G611]] “You [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3756]] know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] He is {from}, [[G1510]] and yet [[G2532]] He opened [[G455]] my [[G1473]] eyes. [[G3788]] 
31 We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] does not listen to [[G191]] sinners, [[G268]] but [[G235]] He does listen to [[G191]] the [[G3778]] one who [[G5100]] worships [Him] [[G2318]] and [[G2532]] does [[G4160]] His [[G846]] will. [[G2307]] 
32 Never [[G3756]] before [[G165]] {has} anyone [[G5100]] heard of [[G191]] opening [[G455]] [the] eyes [[G3788]] of a man born [[G1080]] blind. [[G5185]] 
33 If [[G1487]] this [man] [[G3778]] were [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] from [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] He could [[G1410]] do [[G4160]] no such thing.” [[G3762]] 
34 They replied, [[G611]] “You [[G4771]] were born [[G1080]] in [[G1722]] utter [[G3650]] sin, [[G266]] and [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] are instructing [[G1321]] us?” [[G1473]] And [[G2532]] they threw [[G1544]] him [[G846]] out. [[G1854]] 
35 [When] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] they had thrown [[G1544]] him [[G846]] out, [[G1854]] He found [[G2147]] [the man] [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “{Do} you [[G4771]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] Man?” [[G444]] 
36 “Who [[G5101]] is He, [[G1510]] Sir?” [[G2962]] he [[G1565]] replied. [[G611]] “[Tell me] so that [[G2443]] I may believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him.” [[G846]] 
37 “You have already seen [[G3708]] Him,” [[G846]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered. [[G2036]] “He [[G1565]] is [[G1510]] the [One] [[G3588]] speaking [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] you.” [[G4771]] 
38 “Lord, [[G2962]] I believe,” [[G4100]] he said. [[G5346]] And [[G2532]] he worshiped [[G4352]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
39 Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared, [[G2036]] “For [[G1519]] judgment [[G2917]] I [[G1473]] have come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] world, [[G2889]] so that [[G2443]] the blind [[G991]] may see [[G991]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] see [[G991]] may become [[G1096]] blind.” [[G5185]] 
40 [Some] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] who [[G3588]] were [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Him [[G846]] heard [[G191]] this, [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] they asked [[G2036]] Him, [[G846]] “Are [[G1510]] we [[G1473]] blind [[G5185]] too?” [[G2532]] 
41 “If [[G1487]] you were [[G1510]] blind,” [[G5185]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G2036]] “you would not be [[G2192]] guilty of sin. [[G266]] But [[G1161]] since [[G3568]] you claim [[G3004]] [you] can see, [[G991]] your [[G4771]] guilt [[G266]] remains.” [[G3306]]
