1 Later, [[G3326]] by [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Sea [[G2281]] of Tiberias, [[G5085]] Jesus [[G2424]] again [[G3825]] revealed [[G5319]] Himself [[G1438]] to the [[G3588]] disciples. [[G3101]] He made [Himself] known [[G5319]] in this way: [[G3779]] 
2 Simon [[G4613]] Peter, [[G4074]] Thomas [[G2381]] called [[G3004]] Didymus, [[G1324]] Nathanael [[G3482]] from [[G575]] Cana [[G2580]] in Galilee, [[G1056]] the [sons] [[G3588]] of Zebedee, [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] other [[G243]] disciples [[G3101]] were [[G1510]] together. [[G3674]] 
3 Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “I am going [[G5217]] fishing.” [[G232]] “We [[G1473]] will go [[G2064]] with [[G4862]] you,” [[G4771]] they said. [[G3004]] [So] they went out [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] got [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] [but] [[G2532]] caught [[G4084]] nothing [[G3762]] that [[G1565]] night. [[G3571]] 
4 Early in the morning, [[G4405]] Jesus [[G2424]] stood [[G2476]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] shore, [[G123]] but [[G3305]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] {did} not [[G3756]] recognize [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G1510]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
5 So [[G3767]] [He] [[G2424]] called out [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “Children, [[G3813]] do you have [[G2192]] any [[G5100]] fish?” [[G4371]] “No,” [[G3756]] they answered. [[G611]] 
6 He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Cast [[G906]] the [[G3588]] net [[G1350]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] right [[G1188]] side [[G3313]] of the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] you will find [some].” [[G2147]] So [[G3767]] they cast [it there], [[G906]] and [[G2532]] they were unable [[G2480]] to haul it in [[G1670]] because of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] great number [[G4128]] of [[G3588]] fish. [[G2486]] 
7 Then [[G3767]] [the] [[G1565]] disciple [[G3101]] whom [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved [[G25]] said [[G3004]] to Peter, [[G4074]] “It is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Lord!” [[G2962]] As soon as [[G3767]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] he put on [[G1241]] [his] [[G3588]] outer garment [[G1903]] (for [[G1063]] he had removed it [[G1510]] ) [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] jumped [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]] 
8 The [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciples [[G3101]] came [ashore] [[G2064]] in the [[G3588]] boat. [[G4142]] They dragged in [[G4951]] the [[G3588]] net [[G1350]] full of [[G3588]] fish, [[G2486]] for [[G1063]] they were [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] far [[G3112]] from [[G575]] land, [[G1093]] only [[G235]] about [[G5613]] a hundred yards. [[G1250]] 
9 When [[G5613]] they landed, [[G576]] they saw [[G991]] a charcoal fire [[G439]] there [[G2749]] [with] [[G2532]] fish [[G3795]] on it, [[G1945]] and [[G2532]] [some] bread. [[G740]] 
10 Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Bring [[G5342]] [some] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fish [[G3795]] you have just caught.” [[G4084]] 
11 So [[G3767]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] went aboard [[G305]] and [[G2532]] dragged [[G1670]] the [[G3588]] net [[G1350]] ashore. [[G1093]] [It was] full [[G3324]] of large [[G3173]] fish, [[G2486]] 153 {}, [[G1540]] but even [[G2532]] with [[G1510]] so many, [[G5118]] the [[G3588]] net [[G1350]] was not torn. [[G4977]] 
12 “Come, [[G1205]] have breakfast,” [[G709]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to them. [[G846]] None [[G3762]] of the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] dared [[G5111]] to ask [[G1833]] Him, [[G846]] “Who [[G5101]] are [[G1510]] You?” [[G4771]] They knew [[G1492]] it was [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
13 Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] and [[G2532]] gave [it] [[G1325]] to them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [He did] the same with [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] fish. [[G3795]] 
14 This [was] [[G3778]] now [[G2235]] the third time [[G5154]] Jesus [[G2424]] appeared [[G5319]] to [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] after He was raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]] 
15 When [[G3753]] they had finished eating, [[G709]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked [[G3004]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter, [[G4074]] “Simon [[G4613]] [son] of John, [[G2491]] do you love [[G25]] Me [[G1473]] more [[G4119]] than these?” [[G3778]] “Yes, [[G3483]] Lord,” [[G2962]] he answered, [[G3004]] “You [[G4771]] know [[G1492]] I love [[G5368]] You.” [[G4771]] [Jesus] replied, [[G3004]] “Feed [[G1006]] My [[G1473]] lambs.” [[G721]] 
16 [Jesus] asked [[G3004]] a second time, [[G1208]] “Simon [[G4613]] [son] of John, [[G2491]] do you love [[G25]] Me?” [[G1473]] “Yes, [[G3483]] Lord,” [[G2962]] he answered, [[G3004]] “You [[G4771]] know [[G1492]] I love [[G5368]] You.” [[G4771]] [Jesus] told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “Shepherd [[G4165]] My [[G1473]] sheep.” [[G4263]] 
17 [Jesus] asked [[G3004]] a [[G3588]] third time, [[G5154]] “Simon [[G4613]] [son] of John, [[G2491]] do you love [[G5368]] Me?” [[G1473]] Peter [[G4074]] was deeply hurt [[G3076]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] had asked [[G2036]] him [[G846]] a third time, [[G5154]] “Do you love [[G5368]] Me?” [[G1473]] “Lord, [[G2962]] You [[G4771]] know [[G1492]] all things,” [[G3956]] he replied. [[G2036]] “You [[G4771]] know [[G1097]] I love [[G5368]] You.” [[G4771]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to him, [[G846]] “Feed [[G1006]] My [[G1473]] sheep. [[G4263]] 
18 Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] when [[G3753]] you were [[G1510]] young, [[G3501]] you dressed [[G2224]] yourself [[G4572]] and [[G2532]] walked [[G4043]] where [[G3699]] you wanted; [[G2309]] but [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] you are old, [[G1095]] you will stretch out [[G1614]] your [[G4771]] hands, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] someone else [[G243]] will dress [[G2224]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] lead [you] [[G5342]] where [[G3699]] you do not want to go. [[G2309]] 
19 [Jesus] said [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] to indicate [[G4591]] [the kind of] death [[G2288]] by which [[G4169]] [Peter] would glorify [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]] And [after] [[G2532]] He had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] He told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “Follow [[G190]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
20 Peter [[G4074]] turned [[G1994]] [and] saw [[G991]] the [[G3588]] disciple [[G3101]] whom [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved [[G25]] following [them]. [[G190]] [He was the one] [[G2532]] who [[G3739]] had leaned back [[G377]] [against Jesus] [[G4738]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] supper [[G1173]] to ask, [[G2036]] “Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G5101]] is going to [[G1510]] betray [[G3860]] You? [[G4771]] 
21 [When] [[G3767]] [Peter] saw [[G3708]] him, [[G3778]] [he] [[G4074]] asked, [[G3004]] “Lord, [[G2962]] what about [[G5101]] [him]?” [[G3778]] 
22 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G3004]] “If [[G1437]] I want [[G2309]] him [[G846]] to remain [[G3306]] until [[G2193]] I return, [[G2064]] what [is that] [[G5101]] to [[G4314]] you? [[G4771]] You [[G4771]] follow [[G190]] Me!” [[G1473]] 
23 Because of [[G3767]] this, [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] rumor [[G3056]] spread [[G1831]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] that [[G3754]] this [[G1565]] disciple [[G3101]] {would} not [[G3756]] die. [[G599]] However, [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] did not say [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] he would not die, [[G599]] but only, [[G235]] “If [[G1437]] I want [[G2309]] him [[G846]] to remain [[G3306]] until [[G2193]] I return, [[G2064]] what [is that] [[G5101]] to [[G4314]] you? [[G4771]] 
24 This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] disciple [[G3101]] who [[G3588]] testifies [[G3140]] to [[G4012]] these things [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] who [[G3588]] has written [[G1125]] [them down]. [[G3778]] And [[G2532]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] testimony [[G3141]] is [[G1510]] true. [[G227]] 
25 There are [[G1510]] many [[G4183]] more things [[G243]] that [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] did. [[G4160]] If [[G1437]] all of them [[G2596]] were written down, [[G1125]] I suppose that [[G3633]] not even [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] itself [[G846]] would have space [[G5562]] for the [[G3588]] books [[G975]] that would be written.
