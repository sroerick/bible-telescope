1 “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whoever [[G3588]] does not enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] sheepfold [[G4263]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gate, [[G2374]] but [[G235]] climbs in [[G305]] some other way, [[G237]] is [[G1510]] a thief [[G2812]] and [[G2532]] a robber. [[G3027]] 
2 But [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] enters [[G1525]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gate [[G2374]] is [[G1510]] [the] shepherd [[G4166]] of the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]] 
3 The [[G3588]] gatekeeper [[G2377]] opens [the gate] [[G455]] for him, [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] listen for [[G191]] his [[G846]] voice. [[G5456]] He calls [[G5455]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] sheep [[G4263]] by [[G2596]] name [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] leads them out. [[G1806]] 
4 When [[G3752]] he has brought out [[G1544]] all [[G3956]] [his] [[G3588]] own, [[G2398]] he goes on [[G4198]] ahead of [[G1715]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [his] [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] follow [[G190]] him [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they know [[G1492]] his [[G846]] voice. [[G5456]] 
5 But [[G1161]] they will never follow [[G190]] a stranger; [[G245]] in fact, [[G235]] they will flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they do not recognize [[G1492]] [his] voice.” [[G5456]] 
6 Jesus [[G2424]] spoke [[G2036]] to them [using] [[G846]] this [[G3778]] illustration, [[G3942]] but [[G1161]] they [[G1565]] {did} not [[G3756]] understand [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] He was telling [[G2980]] them. [[G846]] 
7 So [[G3767]] [He] [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to them [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] gate [[G2374]] for the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]] 
8 All [[G3956]] who [[G3745]] came [[G2064]] before [[G4253]] Me [[G1473]] were [[G1510]] thieves [[G2812]] and [[G2532]] robbers, [[G3027]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] did not listen to [[G191]] them. [[G846]] 
9 I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] gate. [[G2374]] If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] enters [[G1525]] through [[G1223]] Me, [[G1473]] he will be saved. [[G4982]] He will come in [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] go out [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] find [[G2147]] pasture. [[G3542]] 
10 The [[G3588]] thief [[G2812]] comes [[G2064]] only [[G1487]] to [[G2443]] steal [[G2813]] and [[G2532]] kill [[G2380]] and [[G2532]] destroy. [[G622]] I [[G1473]] have come [[G2064]] that [[G2443]] they may have [[G2192]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] have [it] [[G2192]] in all its fullness. [[G4053]] 
11 I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] shepherd. [[G4166]] The [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] shepherd [[G4166]] lays down [[G5087]] His [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]] 
12 The [[G3588]] hired hand [[G3411]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] [the] shepherd, [[G4166]] [and] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] his [[G3739]] own. [[G2398]] [When] he sees [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] wolf [[G3074]] coming, [[G2064]] he [[G2532]] abandons [[G863]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] runs away. [[G5343]] Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wolf [[G3074]] pounces [[G726]] on them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] scatters [the flock]. [[G4650]] 
13 [ The man runs away ] because [[G3754]] he is [[G1510]] a hired servant [[G3411]] and [[G2532]] is unconcerned [[G3199]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]] 
14 I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] shepherd. [[G4166]] I know [[G1097]] My [sheep] [[G1699]] and [[G2532]] My [sheep] [[G3588]] know [[G1097]] Me, [[G1473]] 
15 just as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] knows [[G1097]] Me [[G1473]] and I [[G2504]] know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] And [[G2532]] I lay down [[G5087]] My [[G1473]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]] 
16 I have [[G2192]] other [[G243]] sheep [[G4263]] that [[G3739]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] fold. [[G833]] I [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] bring [[G71]] them in as well, [[G2548]] and [[G2532]] they will listen to [[G191]] My [[G1473]] voice. [[G5456]] Then [[G2532]] there will be [[G1096]] one [[G1520]] flock [[G4167]] [and] one [[G1520]] shepherd. [[G4166]] 
17 The reason [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] loves [[G25]] Me [[G1473]] [is] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] lay down [[G5087]] My [[G1473]] life [[G5590]] in order [[G2443]] to take it up [[G2983]] again. [[G3825]] 
18 No one [[G3762]] takes [[G142]] it [[G846]] from [[G575]] Me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] I [[G1473]] lay it down [[G5087]] of [[G575]] My own accord. [[G1683]] I have [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] to lay it down [[G5087]] and [[G2532]] authority [[G1849]] to take it up [[G2983]] again. [[G3825]] This [[G3778]] charge [[G1785]] I have received [[G2983]] from [[G3844]] My [[G1473]] Father. [[G3962]] 
19 Again [[G3825]] there was [[G1096]] division [[G4978]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] because of [[G1223]] [Jesus’] [[G3778]] message. [[G3056]] 
20 Many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] “He is [[G2192]] demon-possessed [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] insane. [[G3105]] Why [[G5101]] would you listen to [[G191]] Him?” [[G846]] 
21 [But] others [[G243]] replied, [[G2036]] “These [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] of [a man] possessed by a demon. [[G1139]] Can [[G1410]] a demon [[G1140]] open [[G455]] [the] eyes [[G3788]] of [the] blind?” [[G5185]] 
22 At that time [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] Feast of Dedication [[G1456]] took place [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]] It was [[G1510]] winter, [[G5494]] 
23 and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] was walking [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] in [[G1722]] Solomon’s [[G4672]] Colonnade. [[G4745]] 
24 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] gathered around [[G2944]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] demanded, [[G2036]] “How long [[G2193]] will You keep us in suspense? [[G142]] If [[G1487]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] tell [[G2036]] us [[G1473]] plainly.” [[G3954]] 
25 “I already told [[G2036]] you,” [[G4771]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “but [[G2532]] you did not believe. [[G4100]] The [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] I [[G1473]] do [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] Father’s [[G3962]] name [[G3686]] testify [[G3140]] on My behalf. [[G1473]] 
26 But [[G235]] because [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] My [[G1699]] sheep, [[G4263]] you [[G4771]] refuse [[G3756]] to believe. [[G4100]] 
27 My [[G1699]] sheep [[G4263]] listen to [[G191]] My [[G1473]] voice; [[G5456]] I [[G2504]] know [[G1097]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they follow [[G190]] Me. [[G1473]] 
28 I [[G2504]] give [[G1325]] them [[G846]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] they will never perish. [[G622]] No [[G3756]] one [[G5100]] can snatch [[G726]] them [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] My [[G1473]] hand. [[G5495]] 
29 My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] who [[G3739]] has given [them] [[G1325]] to Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] greater [[G3173]] than all. [[G3956]] No one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] snatch [them] [[G726]] out of [[G1537]] [My] [[G3588]] Father’s [[G3962]] hand. [[G5495]] 
30 I [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] are [[G1510]] one.” [[G1520]] 
31 At this, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] again [[G3825]] picked up [[G941]] stones [[G3037]] to [[G2443]] stone [[G3034]] Him. [[G846]] 
32 [But] Jesus [[G2424]] responded, [[G611]] “I have shown [[G1166]] you [[G4771]] many [[G4183]] good [[G2570]] works [[G2041]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] For [[G1223]] which [[G4169]] of these [[G846]] do you stone [[G3034]] Me?” [[G1473]] 
33 “We are not stoning [[G3034]] You [[G4771]] for [[G4012]] [any] good [[G2570]] work,” [[G2041]] said [[G611]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] “but [[G235]] for [[G4012]] blasphemy, [[G988]] because [[G3754]] You, [[G4771]] who are [[G1510]] a man, [[G444]] declare Yourself to be [[G4160]] God.” [[G2316]] 
34 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Is it [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] Law: [[G3551]] ‘I [[G1473]] have said [[G2036]] you are [[G1510]] gods’? [[G2316]] 
35 If [[G1487]] he called [[G2036]] them [[G1565]] gods [[G2316]] to [[G4314]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] came— [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] cannot [[G1410]] be broken— [[G3089]] 
36 [ then what about the One ] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] sanctified [[G37]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world? [[G2889]] How then [[G3754]] {can} you [[G4771]] accuse [Me] [[G3004]] of blasphemy [[G987]] for [[G3754]] stating that [[G2036]] I am [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God? [[G2316]] 
37 If [[G1487]] I am not doing [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G3588]] My [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] [then] {do} not [[G3361]] believe [[G4100]] Me. [[G1473]] 
38 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I am doing [them], [[G4160]] even though [[G2579]] you do not believe [[G4100]] Me, [[G1473]] believe [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] works [themselves], [[G2041]] so that [[G2443]] you may know [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] understand [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] [is] in [[G1722]] Me, [[G1473]] and I [[G2504]] am in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] 
39 At this, [[G3767]] they tried [[G2212]] again [[G3825]] to seize [[G4084]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G2532]] He escaped [[G1831]] their [[G846]] grasp. [[G5495]] 
40 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] went [[G565]] back [[G3825]] across [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] Jordan [[G2446]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] John [[G2491]] had [[G1510]] first [[G4413]] been baptizing, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] He stayed [[G3306]] there. [[G1563]] 
41 Many [[G4183]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “Although [[G3303]] John [[G2491]] never [[G3762]] performed [[G4160]] a sign, [[G4592]] everything [[G3956]] [he] [[G2491]] said [[G2036]] about [[G4012]] this [man] [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] true.” [[G227]] 
42 And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] in that place [[G1563]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] [Jesus]. [[G846]]
