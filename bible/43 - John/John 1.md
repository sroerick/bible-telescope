# John 1
[[Luke 24|←]] • [[John 2|→]]
1 In [[G1722]] [the] beginning [[G746]] was [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] was [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] was [[G1510]] God. [[G2316]] 
2 He [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] [the] beginning. [[G746]] 
3 Through [[G1223]] Him [[G846]] all things [[G3956]] were made, [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] without [[G5565]] Him [[G846]] nothing [[G3761]] was made [[G1096]] that [[G3739]] has been made. [[G1096]] 
4 In [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] was [[G1510]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] [that] [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] was [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] of men. [[G444]] 
5 The [[G3588]] Light [[G5457]] shines [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] darkness, [[G4653]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] darkness [[G4653]] {has} not [[G3756]] overcome [[G2638]] it. [[G846]] 
6 There came [[G1096]] a man [[G444]] who was sent [[G649]] from [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]] His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] [was] John. [[G2491]] 
7 He [[G3778]] came [[G2064]] as [[G1519]] a witness [[G3141]] to [[G2443]] testify [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Light, [[G5457]] so that [[G2443]] through [[G1223]] him [[G846]] everyone [[G3956]] might believe. [[G4100]] 
8 He himself [[G1565]] was [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Light, [[G5457]] but [[G235]] he came to testify [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Light. [[G5457]] 
9 The [[G3588]] TRUE [[G228]] Light [[G5457]] who [[G3739]] gives light to [[G5461]] every [[G3956]] man [[G444]] was [[G1510]] coming [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] 
10 He was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [though] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] was made [[G1096]] through [[G1223]] Him, [[G846]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] {did} not [[G3756]] recognize [[G1097]] Him. [[G846]] 
11 He came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] [His] [[G3588]] own, [[G2398]] and [[G2532]] [His] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] {did} not [[G3756]] receive [[G3880]] Him. [[G846]] 
12 But [[G1161]] to [[G846]] all who [[G3745]] did receive [[G2983]] Him, [[G846]] to those [[G3588]] who believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] His [[G846]] name, [[G3686]] He gave [[G1325]] the right [[G1849]] to become [[G1096]] children [[G5043]] of God— [[G2316]] 
13 [children] [[G3739]] born [[G1080]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] blood, [[G129]] nor [[G3761]] of [[G1537]] [the] desire [[G2307]] [or] [[G3761]] will [[G2307]] of man, [[G435]] but [born] [[G235]] of [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]] 
14 The [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] became [[G1096]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] made His dwelling [[G4637]] among [[G1722]] us. [[G1473]] We have seen [[G2300]] His [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] [the] glory [[G1391]] of [[G5613]] [the] one and only Son [[G3439]] from [[G3844]] [the] Father, [[G3962]] full [[G4134]] of grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] truth. [[G225]] 
15 John [[G2491]] testified [[G3140]] concerning [[G4012]] Him. [[G846]] He cried out, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] is He [[G1510]] of whom [[G3739]] I said, [[G2036]] ‘He who [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me [[G1473]] has [[G1096]] surpassed [[G1715]] me [[G1473]] because [[G3754]] He was [[G1510]] before [[G4413]] me. [[G1473]] 
16 From [[G1537]] His [[G846]] fullness [[G4138]] we [[G1473]] {have} all [[G3956]] received [[G2983]] grace [[G5485]] upon [[G473]] grace. [[G5485]] 
17 For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] was given [[G1325]] through [[G1223]] Moses; [[G3475]] grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] truth [[G225]] came [[G1096]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
18 No one [[G3762]] has ever seen [[G3708]] God, [[G2316]] [but the] one and only Son, [[G3439]] [ who is Himself ] God [[G2316]] [and] [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Father’s [[G3962]] side, [[G2859]] has made [Him] known. [[G1834]] 
19 And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] John’s [[G2491]] testimony [[G3141]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] of [[G1537]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] sent [[G649]] priests [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] Levites [[G3019]] to [[G2443]] ask [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] “Who [[G5101]] are [[G1510]] you?” [[G4771]] 
20 He did not refuse to confess, [[G3670]] but [[G2532]] openly declared, [[G3670]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Christ.” [[G5547]] 
21 “Then [[G3767]] who [are you]?” [[G5101]] they inquired. [[G2065]] “Are [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] Elijah?” [[G2243]] He said, [[G3004]] “I am [[G1510]] not.” [[G3756]] “Are [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] Prophet?” [[G4396]] He answered, [[G611]] “No.” [[G3756]] 
22 So [[G3767]] they said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] “Who [[G5101]] are you? [[G1510]] We need [[G1325]] an answer [[G612]] for those [[G3588]] who sent [[G3992]] us. [[G1473]] What [[G5101]] do you say [[G3004]] about [[G4012]] yourself?” [[G4572]] 
23 [John] replied [[G5346]] in [[G2531]] the words of [[G2036]] Isaiah [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet: [[G4396]] “I [am] [[G1473]] the voice [[G5456]] of one calling [[G994]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] ‘Make straight [[G2116]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] for [the] Lord.’” [[G2962]] 
24 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] who had been sent [[G649]] 
25 asked [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] “Why [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] do you baptize, [[G907]] if [[G1487]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] nor [[G3761]] Elijah, [[G2243]] nor [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] Prophet?” [[G4396]] 
26 “I [[G1473]] baptize [[G907]] with [[G1722]] water,” [[G5204]] John [[G2491]] replied, [[G611]] “but among [[G3319]] you [[G4771]] stands [[G2476]] [One] [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3756]] know. [[G1492]] 
27 [He is] the One who [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me, [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] straps [[G2438]] of whose [[G3739]] sandals [[G5266]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] to [[G2443]] untie.” [[G3089]] 
28 All this [[G3778]] happened [[G1096]] at [[G1722]] Bethany [[G963]] beyond [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] Jordan, [[G2446]] where [[G3699]] John [[G2491]] was [[G1510]] baptizing. [[G907]] 
29 The [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] [John] saw [[G991]] Jesus [[G2424]] coming [[G2064]] toward [[G4314]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] “Look, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G286]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] takes away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] sin [[G266]] of the [[G3588]] world! [[G2889]] 
30 This is [[G1510]] He [[G3778]] of [[G5228]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] said, [[G2036]] ‘A man [[G435]] who comes [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me [[G1473]] has [[G1096]] surpassed [[G1715]] me [[G1473]] because [[G3754]] He was [[G1510]] before [[G4413]] me.’ [[G1473]] 
31 I myself [[G2504]] {did} not [[G3756]] know [[G1492]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G235]] the reason [[G1223]] I [[G1473]] came [[G2064]] baptizing [[G907]] with [[G1722]] water [[G5204]] [was] that [[G2443]] He might be revealed [[G5319]] to Israel.” [[G2474]] 
32 Then [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] testified, [[G3140]] “I saw [[G2300]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] descending [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] like [[G5613]] a dove [[G4058]] and [[G2532]] resting [[G3306]] on [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]] 
33 I myself [[G2504]] {did} not [[G3756]] know [[G1492]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G235]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] me [[G1473]] to baptize [[G907]] with [[G1722]] water [[G5204]] told [[G2036]] me, [[G1473]] ‘[The man] on [[G1909]] whom [[G3739]] you see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] descend [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] rest [[G3306]] is [[G1510]] He [[G3588]] who will baptize [[G907]] with [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
34 I [[G2504]] have seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] testified [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God.” [[G2316]] 
35 The [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] John [[G2491]] was there [[G2476]] again [[G3825]] with [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]] 
36 When [[G2532]] he saw [[G1689]] Jesus [[G2424]] walking by, [[G4043]] he said, [[G3004]] “Look, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G286]] of God!” [[G2316]] 
37 And when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] say this, [[G2980]] they followed [[G190]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
38 Jesus [[G2424]] turned [[G4762]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2300]] them [[G846]] following. [[G190]] “What [[G5101]] do you want?” [[G2212]] He asked. [[G3004]] They said [[G2036]] to Him, [[G846]] “Rabbi” [[G4461]] (which [[G3739]] means [[G3177]] Teacher), [[G1320]] “where [[G4226]] are You staying?” [[G3306]] 
39 “Come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see,” [[G3708]] He replied. [[G3004]] So [[G3767]] they went [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G3708]] where [[G4225]] He was staying, [[G3306]] and [[G2532]] spent [[G3306]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] with [[G3844]] Him. [[G846]] It was [[G1510]] about [[G5613]] [the] tenth [[G1182]] hour. [[G5610]] 
40 Andrew, [[G406]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter’s [[G4074]] brother, [[G80]] was [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] who [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] John’s [ testimony ] [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
41 He [[G3778]] first [[G4412]] found [[G2147]] [his] [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] Simon [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “We have found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] Messiah” [[G3323]] (which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] translated as [[G3177]] Christ). [[G5547]] 
42 [Andrew] brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] [who] [[G2424]] looked at [[G1689]] him [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] Simon [[G4613]] son [[G5207]] of John. [[G2491]] You [[G4771]] will be called [[G2564]] Cephas” [[G2786]] (which [[G3739]] is translated as [[G2059]] Peter). [[G4074]] 
43 The [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] [Jesus] decided [[G2309]] to set out [[G1831]] for [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]] Finding [[G2147]] Philip, [[G5376]] [He] [[G2424]] told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “Follow [[G190]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
44 Now [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] was [[G1510]] from [[G575]] Bethsaida, [[G966]] the [[G3588]] [same] town [[G4172]] as Andrew [[G406]] and [[G2532]] Peter. [[G4074]] 
45 Philip [[G5376]] found [[G2147]] Nathanael [[G3482]] and [[G2532]] told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “We have found [[G2147]] the [One] [[G3739]] Moses [[G3475]] wrote about [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] [ the One] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets [foretold]— [[G4396]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G575]] Nazareth, [[G3478]] [the] son [[G5207]] of Joseph. [[G2501]] 
46 “Can [[G1410]] anything good [[G18]] come [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] Nazareth?” [[G3478]] Nathanael [[G3482]] asked. [[G2036]] “Come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see,” [[G2400]] said [[G3004]] Philip. [[G5376]] 
47 [When] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] Nathanael [[G3482]] approaching, [[G2064]] He said [[G3004]] of [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] “Here [[G2400]] [is] a true [[G230]] Israelite, [[G2475]] in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] deceit.” [[G1388]] 
48 “How [[G4159]] do You know [[G1097]] me?” [[G1473]] Nathanael [[G3482]] asked. [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Before [[G4253]] Philip [[G5376]] called [[G5455]] you, [[G4771]] I saw [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] under [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] fig tree.” [[G4808]] 
49 “Rabbi,” [[G4461]] Nathanael [[G3482]] answered, [[G611]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God! [[G2316]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the King [[G935]] of Israel!” [[G2474]] 
50 Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] “Do you believe [[G4100]] just because [[G3754]] I told [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] I saw [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] fig tree? [[G4808]] You will see [[G3708]] greater things [[G3173]] than these.” [[G3778]] 
51 Then [[G2532]] He declared, [[G3004]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] you will see [[G3708]] heaven [[G3772]] open [[G455]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] of God [[G2316]] ascending [[G305]] and [[G2532]] descending [[G2597]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man.” [[G444]]
