1 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of Olives. [[G1636]] 
2 Early in the morning [[G3722]] He went [back] [[G3854]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple courts. [[G2411]] All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He sat down [[G2523]] to teach [[G1321]] them. [[G846]] 
3 The [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] however, [[G1161]] brought [[G71]] to [[G4314]] Him [[G846]] a woman [[G1135]] caught [[G2638]] in [[G1909]] adultery. [[G3430]] They made her stand [[G2476]] before them [[G1722]] 
4 [and] said, [[G3004]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] this [[G3778]] woman [[G1135]] was caught [[G2638]] in [[G1909]] the act [[G1888]] of adultery. [[G3431]] 
5 In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] Moses [[G3475]] commanded [[G1781]] us [[G1473]] to stone [[G3034]] such [a woman]. [[G5108]] So [[G3767]] what [[G5101]] do You say?” [[G3004]] 
6 They said [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] to test [[G3985]] Him, [[G846]] in order [[G2443]] to have [a basis] [[G2192]] for accusing [[G2723]] Him. [[G846]] But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] bent [[G2955]] down [[G2736]] [and] began to write [[G1125]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1093]] with [[G3588]] [His] finger. [[G1147]] 
7 When [[G5613]] they continued [[G1961]] to question [[G2065]] Him, [[G846]] He straightened up [[G352]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “[Let] him who is [[G3588]] without sin [[G361]] among you [[G4771]] [be] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] to cast [[G906]] a stone [[G3037]] at [[G1909]] her.” [[G846]] 
8 And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] He bent down [[G2955]] [and] wrote [[G1125]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]] 
9 When they heard this, [[G191]] they began to go away [[G1831]] one [[G1520]] by [[G2596]] one, [[G1520]] beginning [[G756]] with [[G575]] the [[G3588]] older ones, [[G4245]] until [[G2193]] only [[G3441]] Jesus [[G2424]] was left, [[G2641]] with [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] standing [[G1510]] [there]. [[G3319]] 
10 Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] straightened up [[G352]] [and] asked [[G2036]] her, [[G846]] “Woman, [[G1135]] where [[G4226]] are [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] accusers? [[G2725]] {Has} no one [[G3762]] condemned [[G2632]] you?” [[G4771]] 
11 “No one, [[G3762]] Lord,” [[G2962]] she answered. [[G2036]] “Then neither [[G3761]] do I [[G1473]] condemn [[G2632]] you,” [[G4771]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared. [[G2036]] “Now [[G575]] go [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] sin [[G264]] no more.” [[G3371]] 
12 Once again, [[G3825]] Jesus [[G2424]] spoke [[G2980]] to [the people] [[G846]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] of the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] Whoever [[G3588]] follows [[G190]] Me [[G1473]] will never walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] darkness, [[G4653]] but [[G235]] will have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] of life. [[G2222]] 
13 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] said [[G2036]] to Him, [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] are testifying [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Yourself; [[G4572]] Your [[G4771]] testimony [[G3141]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] valid.” [[G227]] 
14 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Even if [[G2579]] I [[G1473]] testify [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Myself, [[G1683]] My [[G1473]] testimony [[G3141]] is [[G1510]] valid, [[G227]] because [[G3754]] I know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] I came {from} [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] where [[G4226]] I am going. [[G5217]] But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3756]] know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] I came {from} [[G2064]] or [[G2228]] where [[G4226]] I am going. [[G5217]] 
15 You [[G4771]] judge [[G2919]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] flesh; [[G4561]] I [[G1473]] judge [[G2919]] no one. [[G3762]] 
16 But [[G1161]] even [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] I [[G1473]] do judge, [[G2919]] My [[G1699]] judgment [[G2920]] is [[G1510]] true, [[G228]] because [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] alone [ when I judge ]; [[G3441]] I am with [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] [who] sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]] 
17 Even [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5212]] [own] [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] it is written [[G1125]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of two [[G1417]] men [[G444]] is [[G1510]] valid. [[G227]] 
18 I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] [One] [[G3588]] who testifies [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Myself, [[G1683]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] [who] sent [[G3992]] Me, [[G1473]] [also] testifies [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
19 “Where [[G4226]] is [[G1510]] Your [[G4771]] Father?” [[G3962]] they asked [[G2036]] Him. [[G846]] “You do not know [[G1492]] Me [[G1473]] [or] [[G3777]] My [[G1473]] Father,” [[G3962]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered. [[G611]] “If [[G1487]] you knew [[G1492]] Me, [[G1473]] you would know [[G1492]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] as well.” [[G2532]] 
20 He spoke [[G2980]] these [[G3778]] words [[G4487]] while teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] near [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] treasury. [[G1049]] Yet [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] seized [[G4084]] Him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] His [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] {had} not yet [[G3768]] come. [[G2064]] 
21 Again [[G3825]] He said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “I [[G1473]] am going away, [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] you will look for [[G2212]] Me, [[G1473]] [but] [[G2532]] you will die [[G599]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] sin. [[G266]] Where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am going, [[G5217]] you [[G4771]] cannot [[G1410]] come.” [[G2064]] 
22 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] began to ask, [[G2036]] “Will He kill [[G615]] Himself, [[G1438]] since [[G3754]] He says, [[G3004]] ‘Where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am going, [[G5217]] you [[G4771]] cannot [[G1410]] come’?” [[G2064]] 
23 Then [[G2532]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] below; [[G2736]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] above. [[G507]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] of [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] world; [[G2889]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] world. [[G2889]] 
24 That is why [[G3767]] I told [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] you would die [[G599]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] sins. [[G266]] For [[G1063]] unless [[G1437]] you believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [He], [[G1510]] you will die [[G599]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] sins.” [[G266]] 
25 “Who [[G5101]] are [[G1510]] You?” [[G4771]] they asked. [[G2036]] “Just [[G2532]] what [[G3754]] I have been telling [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] from the [[G3588]] beginning,” [[G746]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G2036]] 
26 “I have [[G2192]] much [[G4183]] to say [[G2980]] about [[G4012]] you [[G4771]] and [much] [[G2532]] to judge. [[G2919]] But [[G235]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] truthful, [[G227]] and [[G2504]] what [[G3739]] I have heard [[G191]] from [[G3844]] Him, [[G846]] I tell [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] 
27 They did not understand [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] He was telling [[G2036]] them [[G846]] [about] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] 
28 So [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “When [[G3752]] you have lifted up [[G5312]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man, [[G444]] then [[G5119]] you will know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [He], [[G1510]] and [that] [[G2532]] I do [[G4160]] nothing [[G3762]] on [[G575]] My own, [[G1683]] but [[G235]] speak [[G2980]] exactly [[G2531]] what [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has taught [[G1321]] Me. [[G1473]] 
29 He who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Me. [[G1473]] He has not left [[G863]] Me [[G1473]] alone, [[G3441]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] always [[G3842]] do [[G4160]] what [[G3588]] pleases [[G701]] Him.” [[G846]] 
30 As [Jesus] [[G846]] spoke [[G2980]] these things, [[G3778]] many [[G4183]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him. [[G846]] 
31 So [[G3767]] [He] [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] [who] had believed [[G4100]] Him, [[G846]] “If [[G1437]] you [[G4771]] continue [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1699]] word, [[G3056]] you are [[G1510]] truly [[G230]] My [[G1473]] disciples. [[G3101]] 
32 Then [[G2532]] you will know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] will set you free.” [[G1659]] 
33 “We are [[G1510]] Abraham’s [[G11]] descendants,” [[G4690]] they answered. [[G611]] “We have never been slaves [[G1398]] to [anyone]. [[G3762]] How [[G4459]] {can} You [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] [we] will be set [[G1096]] free?” [[G1658]] 
34 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] sins [[G266]] is [[G1510]] a slave [[G1401]] to [[G3588]] sin. [[G266]] 
35 A slave [[G1401]] {is} not [[G3756]] a permanent [[G165]] member [[G3306]] of [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] family, [[G3614]] [but] a [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] belongs [to it] [[G3306]] forever. [[G165]] 
36 So [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] sets you free, [[G1659]] you will be [[G1510]] free [[G1658]] indeed. [[G3689]] 
37 I know [[G1492]] you are [[G1510]] Abraham’s [[G11]] descendants, [[G4690]] but [[G235]] you are trying [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] Me [[G1473]] because [[G3754]] My [[G1699]] word [[G3056]] has no place [[G5562]] within [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] 
38 I speak [[G2980]] of what [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] have seen [[G3708]] in the presence of [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] you have heard [[G191]] from [[G3844]] [your] [[G3588]] father.” [[G3962]] 
39 “Abraham [[G11]] is [[G1510]] our [[G1473]] father,” [[G3962]] they replied. [[G611]] “If [[G1487]] you were [[G1510]] children [[G5043]] of Abraham,” [[G11]] said [[G3004]] Jesus, [[G2424]] “you would do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of Abraham. [[G11]] 
40 But [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] you are trying [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] Me, [[G1473]] a man [[G444]] who [[G3739]] has told [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] that [[G3739]] I heard [[G191]] from [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]] Abraham [[G11]] never [[G3756]] did [[G4160]] such a thing. [[G3778]] 
41 You [[G4771]] are doing [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] father.” [[G3962]] “We [[G1473]] are not illegitimate children,” [[G1080]] they declared. [[G2036]] “Our [[G2192]] only [[G1520]] Father [[G3962]] [is] God [Himself].” [[G2316]] 
42 Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “If [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] were [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] you would love [[G25]] Me, [[G1473]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] have come [[G1831]] here [[G2240]] from [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]] I have not come [[G2064]] on [[G575]] My own, [[G1683]] but [[G235]] He [[G1565]] sent [[G649]] Me. [[G1473]] 
43 Why [[G1223]] do you not understand [[G1097]] what [[G3588]] I [[G1699]] am saying? [[G2981]] [It is] because [[G3754]] you are unable [[G1410]] to accept [[G191]] My [[G1699]] message. [[G3056]] 
44 You [[G4771]] belong to [[G1510]] [your] [[G3588]] father, [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] you want [[G2309]] to carry out [[G4160]] [his] [[G3962]] desires. [[G1939]] He [[G1565]] was [[G1510]] a murderer [[G443]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning, [[G746]] refusing [[G3756]] to uphold [[G4739]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] because [[G3754]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] truth [[G225]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]] When [[G3752]] he lies, [[G2980]] he speaks [[G2980]] [his] [[G3588]] native [ language], [[G2398]] because [[G3754]] he is [[G1510]] a liar [[G5583]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] of [lies]. [[G846]] 
45 But [[G1161]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] speak [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] you do not believe [[G4100]] Me! [[G1473]] 
46 Which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] can prove Me guilty [[G1651]] of [[G4012]] sin? [[G266]] If [[G1487]] I speak [[G3004]] [the] truth, [[G225]] why [[G1223]] {do} you [[G4771]] not [[G3756]] believe [[G4100]] Me? [[G1473]] 
47 Whoever [[G3588]] belongs to [[G1510]] God [[G2316]] hears [[G191]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] of God. [[G2316]] The reason [[G1223]] you [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3756]] hear [[G191]] is that [[G3754]] you do [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] belong [[G1537]] to God.” [[G2316]] 
48 The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] answered [[G611]] Him, [[G846]] “Are we not [[G3756]] right [[G2573]] to say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] a Samaritan [[G4541]] and [[G2532]] You have [[G2192]] a demon?” [[G1140]] 
49 “I [[G1473]] {do} not [[G3756]] have [[G2192]] a demon,” [[G1140]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “but [[G235]] I honor [[G5091]] My [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] dishonor [[G818]] Me. [[G1473]] 
50 I [[G1473]] {do} not [[G3756]] seek [[G2212]] My [[G1473]] [own] [[G3588]] glory. [[G1391]] There is [[G1510]] One who [[G3588]] seeks [it], [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] He is the Judge. [[G2919]] 
51 Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] if [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] keeps [[G5083]] My [[G1699]] word, [[G3056]] he will never see [[G2334]] death.” [[G2288]] 
52 “Now [[G3568]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] You have [[G2192]] a demon!” [[G1140]] declared [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]] “Abraham [[G11]] died, [[G599]] and so did [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] yet [[G2532]] You [[G4771]] say that [[G3004]] anyone who [[G5100]] keeps [[G5083]] [Your] [[G1473]] word [[G3056]] will never taste [[G1089]] death. [[G2288]] 
53 Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] greater than [[G3173]] our [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] Abraham? [[G11]] [He] [[G3748]] died, [[G599]] [as did] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]] Who [[G5101]] do You claim to be?” [[G4160]] 
54 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “If [[G1437]] I [[G1473]] glorify [[G1392]] Myself, [[G1683]] My [[G1473]] glory [[G1391]] means [[G1510]] nothing. [[G3762]] The [One who] [[G3588]] glorifies [[G1392]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] [of] whom [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] ‘He is [[G1510]] our [[G1473]] God. [[G2316]] 
55 You do not know [[G1097]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] Him. [[G846]] If [[G2579]] I said [[G2036]] I did not know [[G1492]] Him, [[G846]] I would be [[G1510]] a liar [[G5583]] like [[G3664]] you. [[G4771]] But [[G235]] I do know [[G1492]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] I keep [[G5083]] His [[G846]] word. [[G3056]] 
56 Your [[G4771]] father [[G3962]] Abraham [[G11]] was overjoyed [[G21]] to see [[G3708]] My [[G1699]] day. [[G2250]] He saw [it] [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] was glad.” [[G5463]] 
57 Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] “You are [[G2192]] not yet [[G3768]] fifty [[G4004]] years [old], [[G2094]] and [[G2532]] You have seen [[G3708]] Abraham?” [[G11]] 
58 “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you,” [[G4771]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared, [[G2036]] “before [[G4250]] Abraham [[G11]] was born, [[G1096]] I [[G1473]] am!” [[G1510]] 
59 At this, [[G3767]] they picked up [[G142]] stones [[G3037]] to [[G2443]] throw [[G906]] at [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]] But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] was hidden [[G2928]] and [[G2532]] went [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple area. [[G2411]]
