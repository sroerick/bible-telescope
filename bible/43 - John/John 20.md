1 Early [[G4404]] [on] the [[G3588]] first [day] [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] week, [[G4521]] while it was [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] dark, [[G4653]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene [[G3094]] went [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] saw that [[G991]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] had been removed [[G142]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] [entrance]. [[G3419]] 
2 So [[G3767]] she came [[G2064]] running [[G5143]] to [[G4314]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciple, [[G3101]] the one whom [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved. [[G5368]] “They have taken [[G142]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tomb,” [[G3419]] she said, [[G3004]] “and [[G2532]] we do not know [[G1492]] where [[G4226]] they have put [[G5087]] Him!” [[G846]] 
3 Then [[G3767]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciple [[G3101]] set out [[G1831]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] tomb. [[G3419]] 
4 The [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] were running [[G5143]] together, [[G3674]] [but] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciple [[G3101]] outran [[G4390]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] reached [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] first. [[G4413]] 
5 He bent down [[G3879]] [and] looked in at [[G991]] the [[G3588]] linen cloths [[G3608]] lying [there], [[G2749]] but [[G3305]] he did not go in. [[G1525]] 
6 Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] arrived [[G2064]] just [[G2532]] after [[G190]] him. [[G846]] He entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] linen cloths [[G3608]] lying [there]. [[G2749]] 
7 The [[G3588]] face cloth [[G4676]] that [[G3739]] had been [[G1510]] around [[G1909]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] head [[G2776]] was rolled up, [[G1794]] lying [[G2749]] separate [[G5117]] from [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] linen cloths. [[G3608]] 
8 Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciple, [[G3101]] who [[G3588]] had reached [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] first, [[G4413]] also [[G2532]] went in. [[G1525]] And [[G2532]] he saw [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] believed. [[G4100]] 
9 For [[G1063]] they still did not understand [[G1492]] from the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] [[G846]] had to [[G1163]] rise [[G450]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]] 
10 Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] returned [[G565]] to [[G4314]] their [homes]. [[G848]] 
11 But [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] stood [[G2476]] outside [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] weeping. [[G2799]] [And] [[G3767]] as [[G5613]] she wept, [[G2799]] she bent down [[G3879]] [to look] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] tomb, [[G3419]] 
12 and [[G2532]] she saw [[G2334]] two [[G1417]] angels [[G32]] in [[G1722]] white [[G3022]] sitting [[G2516]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Jesus [[G2424]] had lain, [[G2749]] one [[G1520]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] [the other] [[G1520]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] feet. [[G4228]] 
13 “Woman, [[G1135]] why [[G5101]] are you weeping?” [[G2799]] they [[G1565]] asked. [[G3004]] “Because [[G3754]] they have taken [[G142]] my [[G1473]] Lord {away},” [[G2962]] she said, [[G3004]] “and [[G2532]] I do not know [[G1492]] where [[G4226]] they have put [[G5087]] Him.” [[G846]] 
14 When she had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] she turned [[G4762]] around [[G3694]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2334]] Jesus [[G2424]] standing [there]; [[G2476]] [but] [[G2532]] she did not recognize [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G1510]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
15 “Woman, [[G1135]] why [[G5101]] are you weeping?” [[G2799]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked. [[G3004]] “Whom [[G5101]] are you seeking?” [[G2212]] Thinking [[G1380]] He was [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] gardener, [[G2780]] she [[G1565]] said, [[G3004]] “Sir, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] you [[G4771]] have carried Him off, [[G941]] tell [[G2036]] me [[G1473]] where [[G4226]] you have put [[G5087]] Him, [[G846]] and I [[G2504]] will get Him.” [[G142]] 
16 Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to her, [[G846]] “Mary.” [[G3137]] She [[G1565]] turned [[G4762]] [and] said [[G3004]] to Him [[G846]] in Aramaic, [[G1447]] “Rabboni!” [[G4462]] (which [[G3739]] means [[G3004]] Teacher). [[G1320]] 
17 “{Do} not [[G3361]] cling to [[G680]] Me,” [[G1473]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G3004]] “for [[G1063]] I have not yet ascended [[G305]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] But [[G1161]] go [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] tell [[G2036]] My [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] ‘I am ascending [[G305]] to [[G4314]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] to My [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] God.” [[G2316]] 
18 Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene [[G3094]] went [[G2064]] and announced [[G518]] to the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] “I have seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Lord!” [[G2962]] And [she told them] [[G2532]] [what] [[G3778]] He had said [[G2036]] to her. [[G846]] 
19 It was [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] first [[G1520]] day [[G2250]] of [the] week, [[G4521]] [and that] [[G3588]] very [[G1565]] evening, [[G3798]] while [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] were [together] [[G1510]] with [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] doors [[G2374]] locked [[G2808]] for [[G1223]] fear [[G5401]] of the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] stood [[G2476]] among them. [[G3319]] Peace [be] [[G1515]] with you! [[G4771]] He said [[G3004]] to them. [[G846]] 
20 [After] [[G2532]] He had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] He showed [[G1166]] them [[G846]] His [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] His [[G3588]] side. [[G4125]] The [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] rejoiced [[G5463]] when they saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
21 Again [[G3825]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Peace [be] [[G1515]] with you. [[G4771]] As [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has sent Me, [[G649]] so also I [[G2504]] am sending [[G3992]] you.” [[G4771]] 
22 [When] [[G2532]] He had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] He breathed on [them] [[G1720]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] “Receive [[G2983]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
23 If [[G302]] you forgive [[G863]] anyone his [[G5100]] sins, [[G266]] they are forgiven; [[G863]] if [[G302]] you withhold [forgiveness] [[G2902]] from anyone, [[G5100]] it is withheld.” [[G2902]] 
24 Now [[G1161]] Thomas [[G2381]] called [[G3004]] Didymus, [[G1324]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Twelve, [[G1427]] was [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] with [[G3326]] [the disciples] [[G846]] when [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] came. [[G2064]] 
25 So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciples [[G3101]] told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “We have seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Lord!” [[G2962]] But [[G1161]] he replied, [[G2036]] “Unless [[G1437]] I see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] nail [[G2247]] marks [[G5179]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] hands, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] put [[G906]] my [[G1473]] finger [[G1147]] [where] [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] nails [have been], [[G2247]] and [[G2532]] put [[G906]] my [[G1473]] hand [[G5495]] into [[G1519]] His [[G846]] side, [[G4125]] I will never believe.” [[G4100]] 
26 Eight [[G3638]] days [[G2250]] later, [[G3326]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were [[G1510]] once again [[G3825]] inside [[G2080]] [with] the [[G3588]] doors [[G2374]] locked, [[G2808]] and [[G2532]] Thomas [[G2381]] [was] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] stood [[G2476]] among them [[G3319]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Peace [be] [[G1515]] with you. [[G4771]] 
27 Then [[G1534]] [Jesus] said [[G3004]] to Thomas, [[G2381]] “Put [[G5342]] your [[G4771]] finger [[G1147]] here [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] look at [[G2400]] My [[G1473]] hands. [[G5495]] Reach out [[G5342]] your [[G4771]] hand [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] put [it] [[G906]] into [[G1519]] My [[G1473]] side. [[G4125]] Stop doubting [[G571]] and [[G235]] believe. [[G4103]] 
28 Thomas [[G2381]] replied, [[G611]] “My [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] God!” [[G2316]] 
29 Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to him, [[G846]] “Because [[G3754]] you have seen [[G3708]] Me, [[G1473]] you have believed; [[G4100]] blessed [are] [[G3107]] those who [[G3588]] have not seen [[G3708]] and yet [[G2532]] have believed.” [[G4100]] 
30 Jesus [[G2424]] performed [[G4160]] many [[G4183]] other [[G243]] signs [[G4592]] in the presence [[G1799]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] which [[G3739]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] book. [[G975]] 
31 But [[G1161]] these [[G3778]] are written [[G1125]] so that [[G2443]] you may believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] by believing [[G4100]] you may have [[G2192]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] name.
