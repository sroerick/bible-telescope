1 I have told [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] these things [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] you will not fall away. [[G4624]] 
2 They will put [[G4160]] you [[G4771]] out of the synagogues. [[G656]] In fact, [[G235]] a time [[G5610]] is coming [[G2064]] when [[G2443]] anyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] kills [[G615]] you [[G4771]] will think [[G1380]] he is offering [[G4374]] a service [[G2999]] to God. [[G2316]] 
3 They will do [[G4160]] these things [[G3778]] because [[G3754]] they have not known [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] [or] [[G3761]] Me. [[G1473]] 
4 But [[G235]] I have told [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] these things [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] their [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] comes, [[G2064]] you will remember [[G3421]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] told [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] [about] them. [[G846]] I did not tell [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] these things [[G3778]] from [[G1537]] [the] beginning, [[G746]] because [[G3754]] I was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you. [[G4771]] 
5 Now, [[G3568]] however, [[G1161]] I am going [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] Him who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me; [[G1473]] yet [[G2532]] none [[G3762]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] asks [[G2065]] Me, [[G1473]] ‘Where [[G4226]] are You going?’ [[G5217]] 
6 Instead, [[G235]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] are filled [[G4137]] with sorrow [[G3077]] because [[G3754]] I have told [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] these things. [[G3778]] 
7 But [[G235]] I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] it is for your benefit [[G4851]] that [[G2443]] I [[G1473]] am going away. [[G565]] Unless [[G1437]] I go away, [[G565]] the [[G3588]] Advocate [[G3875]] will not come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you; [[G4771]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] I go, [[G4198]] I will send [[G3992]] Him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]] 
8 And [when] [[G2532]] He comes, [[G2064]] He [[G1565]] will convict [[G1651]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] in regard to [[G4012]] sin [[G266]] and [[G2532]] righteousness [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] judgment: [[G2920]] 
9 in regard to [[G4012]] sin, [[G266]] because [[G3754]] they do not believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me; [[G1473]] 
10 in regard to [[G4012]] righteousness, [[G1343]] because [[G3754]] I am going [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] you will no longer see [[G2334]] Me; [[G1473]] 
11 and [[G1161]] in regard to [[G4012]] judgment, [[G2920]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] of this [[G3778]] world [[G2889]] has been condemned. [[G2919]] 
12 I still have [[G2192]] much [[G4183]] to tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] but [[G235]] you cannot [[G1410]] yet [[G737]] bear [to hear it]. [[G941]] 
13 However, [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of truth [[G225]] comes, [[G2064]] He will guide [[G3594]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] truth. [[G225]] For [[G1063]] He will not speak [[G2980]] on [[G575]] His own, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] He will speak [[G2980]] what [[G3745]] He hears, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] He will declare [[G312]] to you [[G4771]] what is [[G3588]] to come. [[G2064]] 
14 He [[G1565]] will glorify [[G1392]] Me [[G1473]] by taking [[G2983]] from [[G1537]] what [is] [[G3588]] Mine [[G1699]] and [[G2532]] disclosing [it] [[G312]] to you. [[G4771]] 
15 Everything [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] belongs [[G2192]] to the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] Mine. [[G1699]] That is why [[G1223]] I said [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] [the Spirit] will take [[G2983]] from [[G1537]] what [is] [[G3588]] Mine [[G1699]] and [[G2532]] disclose [it] [[G312]] to you. [[G4771]] 
16 In a little [while] [[G3398]] you will see [[G2334]] Me [[G1473]] no more, [[G3765]] and [[G2532]] then [[G3825]] after a little [while] [[G3398]] you will see [[G3708]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
17 Then [[G3767]] [some] of [[G1537]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G2036]] one another, [[G240]] “Why [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] He telling [[G3004]] us, [[G1473]] ‘In a little [while] [[G3398]] you will not see [[G2334]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] then [[G3825]] after a little [while] [[G3398]] you will see [[G3708]] Me’ [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] ‘Because [[G3754]] I am going [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father’? [[G3962]] 
18 They kept asking, [[G2036]] “Why [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] He saying, [[G3004]] ‘a [[G3588]] little [while]’? [[G3398]] We do not understand [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] He is saying.” [[G2980]] 
19 Aware [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] they wanted [[G2309]] to question [[G2065]] Him, [[G846]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Are you asking [[G2212]] one another [[G240]] why [[G4012]] I said, [[G2036]] ‘In a little [while] [[G3398]] you will not see [[G2334]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] then [[G3825]] after a little [while] [[G3398]] you will see [[G3708]] Me’? [[G1473]] 
20 Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] you [[G4771]] will weep [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] wail [[G2354]] [while] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] rejoices. [[G5463]] You [[G4771]] will grieve, [[G3076]] but [[G235]] your [[G4771]] grief [[G3077]] will turn [[G1096]] to [[G1519]] joy. [[G5479]] 
21 A woman [[G1135]] has [[G2192]] pain [[G3077]] in childbirth [[G5088]] because [[G3754]] her [[G846]] time [[G5610]] has come; [[G2064]] but [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] she brings forth [[G1080]] [her] [[G3588]] child, [[G3813]] she forgets [[G3421]] [her] [[G3588]] anguish [[G2347]] because of [[G1223]] [her] [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] that [[G3754]] a child [[G444]] has been born [[G1080]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] 
22 So [[G3767]] also [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] have [[G2192]] sorrow [[G3077]] now, [[G3568]] but [[G1161]] I will see [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] again [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] will rejoice, [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] will take [[G142]] away [[G575]] your [[G4771]] joy. [[G5479]] 
23 In [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] you will {no longer} ask [[G2065]] Me [[G1473]] [anything]. [[G3762]] Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whatever [[G5100]] you ask [[G154]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] He will give [[G1325]] you. [[G4771]] 
24 Until [[G2193]] now [[G737]] you have not asked [[G154]] [for anything] [[G3762]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] name. [[G3686]] Ask [[G154]] and [[G2532]] you will receive, [[G2983]] so that [[G2443]] your [[G4771]] joy [[G5479]] may be [[G1510]] complete. [[G4137]] 
25 I have spoken [[G2980]] these things [[G3778]] to you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] figures of speech. [[G3942]] A time [[G5610]] is coming [[G2064]] when [[G3753]] I will no longer speak [[G2980]] to you [[G4771]] [this way], [[G3942]] but [[G235]] will tell [[G518]] you [[G4771]] plainly [[G3954]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] 
26 In [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] you will ask [[G154]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] name. [[G3686]] I am not saying [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] will ask [[G2065]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] on [[G4012]] your behalf. [[G4771]] 
27 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] Himself [[G846]] loves [[G5368]] you, [[G4771]] because [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] have loved [[G5368]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] have believed [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] came [[G1831]] from [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]] 
28 I came [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] entered [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] In turn, [[G3825]] I will leave [[G863]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father.” [[G3962]] 
29 His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] said, [[G3004]] “See, [[G2400]] now [[G3568]] You are speaking [[G2980]] plainly [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] without [[G3762]] figures of speech. [[G3942]] 
30 Now [[G3568]] we understand [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] You know [[G1492]] all things [[G3956]] and that [[G2532]] You have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] for [[G2443]] anyone [[G5100]] to question [[G2065]] You. [[G4771]] Because of [[G1722]] this, [[G3778]] we believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] You came [[G1831]] from [[G575]] God.” [[G2316]] 
31 “Do you finally believe?” [[G4100]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G611]] 
32 “Look, [[G2400]] an hour [[G5610]] is coming [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] has already come [[G2064]] when [[G2443]] you will be scattered, [[G4650]] each [[G1538]] to [[G1519]] [his] [[G3588]] own [home], [[G2398]] {and} you will leave [[G863]] Me [[G2504]] all alone. [[G3441]] Yet [[G2532]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] alone, [[G3441]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Me. [[G1473]] 
33 I have told [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] these things [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] Me [[G1473]] you may have [[G2192]] peace. [[G1515]] In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] you will have [[G2192]] tribulation. [[G2347]] But [[G235]] take courage; [[G2293]] I [[G1473]] have overcome [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] world!” [[G2889]]
