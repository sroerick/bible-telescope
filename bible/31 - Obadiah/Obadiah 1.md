# Obadiah 1
[[Amos 9|←]] • [[Jonah 1|→]]
1 [This is] the vision [[H2377]] of Obadiah: [[H5662]] This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] about Edom— [[H123]] We have heard [[H8085]] a message [[H8052]] from the LORD; [[H3068]] an envoy [[H6735]] has been sent [[H7971]] among the nations [[H1471]] [to say,] “Rise up, [[H6965]] and let us go [[H6965]] to battle [[H4421]] against her!” [[H5921]] 
2 “Behold, [[H2009]] I will make you [[H5414]] small [[H6996]] among the nations; [[H1471]] you [[H859]] will be deeply [[H3966]] despised. [[H959]] 
3 The pride [[H2087]] of your heart [[H3820]] has deceived you— [[H5377]] O dwellers [[H7931]] in the clefts [[H2288]] of the rocks [[H5553]] whose habitation is [[H7674]] the heights, [[H4791]] who say [[H559]] in your heart, [[H3820]] ‘Who [[H4310]] can bring me down [[H3381]] to the ground?’ [[H776]] 
4 Though [[H518]] you soar [[H1361]] like the eagle [[H5404]] and make [[H7760]] your nest [[H7064]] among [[H996]] the stars, [[H3556]] even from there [[H8033]] I will bring you down,” [[H3381]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 “If [[H518]] thieves [[H1590]] came [[H935]] to you,  if [[H518]] robbers [[H7703]] by night— [[H3915]] oh, how [[H349]] you will be ruined— [[H1820]] would they not [[H3808]] steal [[H1589]] [only] what they wanted? [[H1767]] If [[H518]] grape pickers [[H1219]] came [[H935]] to you,  would they not [[H3808]] leave [[H7604]] [some] gleanings? [[H5955]] 
6 But how [[H349]] Esau [[H6215]] will be pillaged, [[H2664]] his hidden treasures [[H4710]] sought out! [[H1158]] 
7 All [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] allied with you [[H1285]] will drive [[H7971]] you to [[H5704]] the border; [[H1366]] those at peace with you [[H7965]] will deceive [[H5377]] and overpower [[H3201]] you.  Those who eat [[H582]] your bread [[H3899]] will set [[H7760]] a trap [[H4204]] for you, [[H8478]] without your [[H369]] awareness [[H8394]] of it.  
8 In that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] will I not [[H3808]] destroy [[H6]] the wise [men] [[H2450]] of Edom [[H123]] and the men of understanding [[H8394]] in the mountains [[H2022]] of Esau? [[H6215]] 
9 Then your mighty men, [[H1368]] O Teman, [[H8487]] will be terrified, [[H2865]] so that [[H4616]] everyone [[H376]] in the mountains [[H2022]] of Esau [[H6215]] will be cut down [[H3772]] in the slaughter. [[H6993]] 
10 Because of the violence [[H2555]] against your brother [[H251]] Jacob, [[H3290]] you will be covered [[H3680]] with shame [[H955]] and cut off [[H3772]] forever. [[H5769]] 
11 On the day [[H3117]] you stood [[H5975]] aloof [[H5048]] while [[H3117]] strangers [[H2114]] carried off [[H7617]] his wealth [[H2428]] and foreigners [[H5237]] entered [[H935]] his gate [[H8179]] and cast [[H3032]] lots [[H1486]] for [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] you [[H859]] were just like one [[H259]] of them. [[H1992]] 
12 But you should not [[H408]] gloat [[H7200]] in that day, [[H3117]] your brother's [[H251]] day [[H3117]] of misfortune, [[H5237]] nor [[H408]] rejoice [[H8055]] over the people [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] in the day [[H3117]] of their destruction, [[H6]] nor [[H408]] boast proudly [[H1431]] in the day [[H3117]] of their distress. [[H6869]] 
13 You should not [[H408]] enter [[H935]] the gate [[H8179]] of My people [[H5971]] in the day [[H3117]] of their disaster, [[H343]] nor [[H408]] gloat [[H7200]] over [[H1571]] their affliction [[H7451]] in the day [[H3117]] of their disaster, [[H343]] nor [[H408]] loot [[H7971]] their wealth [[H2428]] in the day [[H3117]] of their disaster. [[H343]] 
14 Nor should you [[H408]] stand [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] the crossroads [[H6563]] to cut off [[H3772]] their fugitives, [[H6412]] nor [[H408]] deliver up [[H5462]] their survivors [[H8300]] in the day [[H3117]] of their distress. [[H6869]] 
15 For [[H3588]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is near [[H7138]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations. [[H1471]] As [[H834]] you have done, [[H6213]] it will be done [[H6213]] to you;  your recompense [[H1576]] will return [[H7725]] upon your own head. [[H7218]] 
16 For [[H3588]] as [[H834]] you have drunk [[H8354]] on [[H5921]] My holy [[H6944]] hill, [[H2022]] so all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] will drink [[H8354]] continually. [[H8548]] They will drink [[H8354]] and gulp down, [[H3886]] and be [[H1961]] as if they had never [[H3808]] been. [[H1961]] 
17 But on Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] there will be [[H1961]] deliverance, [[H6413]] and it will be [[H1961]] holy, [[H6944]] and the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] will reclaim [[H3423]] their possession. [[H4180]] 
18 Then the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] will be [[H1961]] a blazing fire, [[H784]] and the house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] a burning flame; [[H3852]] but the house [[H1004]] of Esau [[H6215]] will be stubble— [[H7179]] Jacob will set it ablaze [[H1814]] and consume it. [[H398]] Therefore no [[H3808]] survivor [[H8300]] will remain [[H1961]] from the house [[H1004]] of Esau.” [[H6215]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken. [[H1696]] 
19 Those from the Negev [[H5045]] will possess [[H3423]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Esau; [[H6215]] those from the foothills [[H8219]] [will possess the land] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] They will occupy [[H3423]] the fields [[H7704]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and Samaria, [[H8111]] and Benjamin [will possess] [[H1144]] Gilead. [[H1568]] 
20 And the exiles [[H1546]] of this [[H2088]] host [[H2426]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] [will possess the land] of the Canaanites [[H3669]] as [[H5704]] far as Zarephath; [[H6886]] and the exiles [[H1546]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] who [[H834]] are in Sepharad [[H5614]] will possess [[H3423]] the cities [[H5892]] of the Negev. [[H5045]] 
21 The deliverers [[H3467]] will ascend [[H5927]] Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] to rule over [[H8199]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Esau. [[H6215]] And the kingdom [[H4410]] will belong to [[H1961]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
