# Malachi 1
[[Zechariah 14|←]] • [[Malachi 2|→]]
1 [This is] an oracle, [[H4853]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] Israel [[H3478]] through [[H3027]] Malachi: [[H4401]] 
2 “I have loved you,” [[H157]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] But you ask, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] have You loved us?” [[H157]] “Was not [[H3808]] Esau [[H6215]] Jacob’s [[H3290]] brother?” [[H251]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Yet Jacob [[H3290]] I have loved, [[H157]] 
3 but [[H853]] Esau [[H6215]] I have hated, [[H8130]] and I have made [[H7760]] his mountains [[H2022]] a wasteland [[H8077]] and left his inheritance [[H5159]] to the desert [[H4057]] jackals.” [[H8568]] 
4 Though [[H3588]] Edom [[H123]] may say, [[H559]] “We have been devastated, [[H7567]] but we will rebuild [[H7725]] the ruins,” [[H2723]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “They [[H1992]] may build, [[H1129]] but I [[H589]] will demolish. [[H2040]] They will be called [[H7121]] the Land [[H1366]] of Wickedness, [[H7564]] and a people [[H5971]] toward whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] is indignant [[H2194]] forever. [[H5704]] 
5 You will see this [[H7200]] with your own eyes, [[H5869]] and you yourselves [[H859]] will say, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] is great— [[H1431]] even beyond [[H5921]] the borders [[H1366]] of Israel.’” [[H3478]] 
6 “A son [[H1121]] honors [[H3513]] his father, [[H1]] and a servant [[H5650]] his master. [[H113]] But if [[H518]] I [[H589]] am a father, [[H1]] where [[H346]] is My honor? [[H3519]] And if [[H518]] I [[H589]] am a master, [[H113]] where [[H346]] is your fear of Me?” [[H4172]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] to you  priests [[H3548]] who despise [[H959]] My name. [[H8034]] Yet you ask, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] have we despised [[H959]] Your name?” [[H8034]] 
7 “By presenting [[H5066]] defiled [[H1351]] food [[H3899]] on [[H5921]] My altar.” [[H4196]] You ask, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] have we defiled You?” [[H1351]] “By saying that [[H559]] the table [[H7979]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is contemptible.” [[H959]] 
8 “When [[H3588]] you offer [[H5066]] blind animals [[H5787]] for sacrifice, [[H2076]] is it not [[H369]] wrong? [[H7451]] And when [[H3588]] you present [[H5066]] the lame [[H6455]] and sick [ones], [[H2470]] is it not [[H369]] wrong? [[H7451]] Why not offer them [[H7126]] to your governor! [[H6346]] Would he be pleased [[H7521]] with you or [[H176]] show you favor?” [[H5375]] asks [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
9 “But {ask} now [[H6258]] for God’s [[H410]] favor. [[H2470]] Will He be gracious to us? [[H2603]] Since this [[H2063]] has come [[H1961]] from [[H4480]] your hands, [[H3027]] will He show you favor?” [[H5375]] asks [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
10 “Oh, [[H4310]] that one [[H1571]] of you  would shut [[H5462]] the temple doors, [[H1817]] so that you would no [[H3808]] longer kindle [[H215]] useless [[H2600]] fires on My altar! [[H4196]] I take no [[H369]] pleasure [[H2656]] in you,”  says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] “and I will accept [[H7521]] no [[H3808]] offering [[H4503]] from your hands.” [[H3027]] 
11 “For [[H3588]] My name [[H8034]] will be great [[H1419]] among the nations, [[H1471]] from the rising [[H4217]] to [[H5704]] the setting [[H3996]] of the sun. [[H8121]] In every [[H3605]] place, [[H4725]] incense [[H6999]] and pure [[H2889]] offerings [[H4503]] [will be] presented [[H5066]] in My name, [[H8034]] because [[H3588]] My name [[H8034]] will be great [[H1419]] among the nations,” [[H1471]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
12 “But you [[H859]] profane [[H2490]] it [[H853]] when you say, [[H559]] ‘The table [[H7979]] of the LORD [[H136]] is [[H1931]] defiled, [[H1351]] and its fruit, [[H5108]] its food, [[H400]] is contemptible.’ [[H959]] 
13 You also say: [[H559]] ‘Look, [[H2009]] what a nuisance!’ [[H4972]] And you turn up your nose at [[H5301]] it,” [[H853]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] “You bring [[H935]] as an offering [[H4503]] [animals that are] stolen, [[H1497]] lame, [[H6455]] or sick! [[H2470]] Should I accept [[H7521]] this [[H853]] from your hands?” [[H3027]] asks [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
14 “But cursed [[H779]] [is] the deceiver [[H5230]] who has [[H3426]] an acceptable male [[H2145]] in his flock [[H5739]] and vows to give it, [[H5087]] but sacrifices [[H2076]] a defective [[H7843]] animal to the Lord. [[H136]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am a great [[H1419]] King,” [[H4428]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] “and My name [[H8034]] [is to be] feared [[H3372]] among the nations.” [[H1471]]
