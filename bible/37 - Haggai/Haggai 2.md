[[Haggai 1|←]] • [[Zechariah 1|→]]
1 On the twenty-first day [[H6242]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] through [[H3027]] Haggai [[H2292]] the prophet, [[H5030]] saying: [[H559]] 
2 “Speak [[H559]] to [[H413]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] governor [[H6346]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Jehozadak, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] and also to [[H413]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the people. [[H5971]] Ask them, [[H559]] 
3 ‘Who [[H4310]] is left [[H7604]] among you  who [[H834]] saw [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] in its former [[H7223]] glory? [[H3519]] How [[H4100]] does it look [[H7200]] to you [[H859]] now? [[H6258]] Does it not [[H3808]] appear to you [[H5869]] like nothing [[H369]] in comparison?’ [[H3644]] 
4 But now [[H6258]] take courage, [[H2388]] O Zerubbabel, [[H2216]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Be strong, [[H2388]] O Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Jehozadak, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest. [[H3548]] And be strong, [[H2388]] all [[H3605]] you people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Work! [[H6213]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am with you, [[H854]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
5 This is the promise [[H1697]] I made [[H3772]] to you [[H854]] when you came out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] And My Spirit [[H7307]] remains [[H5975]] among you; [[H8432]] do not [[H408]] be afraid.” [[H3372]] 
6 For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Once [[H259]] more, [[H5750]] in a little while, [[H4592]] I [[H589]] will shake [[H7493]] the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth, [[H776]] the sea [[H3220]] and the dry land. [[H2724]] 
7 I will shake [[H7493]] all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H1471]] and they will come [[H935]] with all [their] treasures, [[H2532]] and I will fill [[H4390]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] with glory, [[H3519]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
8 The silver [is] [[H3701]] Mine,  and the gold [is] [[H2091]] Mine,  declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] 
9 The latter [[H314]] glory [[H3519]] of this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] will be [[H1961]] greater [[H1419]] than [[H4480]] the former, [[H7223]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] And in this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] I will provide [[H5414]] peace, [[H7965]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts.” [[H6635]] 
10 On the twenty-fourth day [[H6242]] of the ninth [month], [[H8671]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Darius, [[H1867]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3069]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Haggai [[H2292]] the prophet, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]] 
11 “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘Ask [[H7592]] the priests [[H3548]] for a ruling. [[H8451]] 
12 If [[H2005]] a man [[H376]] carries [[H5375]] consecrated [[H6944]] meat [[H1320]] in the fold [[H3671]] of his garment, [[H899]] and it [[H3671]] touches [[H5060]] bread, [[H3899]] stew, [[H5138]] wine, [[H3196]] oil, [[H8081]] or any [[H3605]] other food, [[H3978]] does [that item] become holy?’” [[H6942]] “No,” [[H3808]] replied [[H6030]] the priests. [[H3548]] 
13 So Haggai [[H2292]] asked, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] [one who is] defiled [[H2931]] by contact with a corpse [[H5315]] touches [[H5060]] any [[H3605]] of these, [[H428]] does it become defiled?” [[H2930]] “Yes, it becomes defiled,” [[H2930]] the priests [[H3548]] answered. [[H6030]] 
14 Then Haggai [[H2292]] replied: [[H6030]] “So [[H3651]] is this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and so [[H3651]] is this [[H2088]] nation [[H1471]] before Me, [[H6440]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and so [[H3651]] is every [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] of their hands; [[H3027]] and whatever [[H834]] they offer [[H7126]] there [[H8033]] is defiled. [[H2931]] 
15 Now [[H6258]] consider [[H3824]] carefully [[H4994]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] forward: [[H4605]] Before [[H2962]] one stone [[H68]] was placed [[H7760]] on [[H413]] another [[H68]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] 
16 from that time [[H1961]] [when] one came [[H935]] expecting [[H413]] a heap [[H6194]] of twenty [ephahs of grain], [[H6242]] there were [[H1961]] [but] ten. [[H6235]] When one came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the winepress [[H3342]] to draw out [[H2834]] fifty [baths], [[H2572]] there were [[H1961]] [but] twenty. [[H6242]] 
17 I struck you— [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of your hands— [[H3027]] with blight, [[H7711]] mildew, [[H3420]] and hail, [[H1259]] but you did not [[H369]] turn to Me, [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
18 Consider carefully [[H7760]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] forward— [[H4605]] from [[H4480]] the twenty-fourth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the ninth [month], [[H8671]] the day [[H3117]] the foundation of the LORD’s [[H3068]] temple [[H1964]] was laid— [[H3245]] consider carefully: [[H7760]] 
19 Is there still [[H5750]] seed [[H2233]] in the barn? [[H4035]] The vine, [[H1612]] the fig, [[H8384]] the pomegranate, [[H7416]] and the olive [[H2132]] tree [[H6086]] have not [[H3808]] yet [[H5704]] yielded [fruit]. [[H5375]] But from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] day on, [[H3117]] I will bless you.” [[H1288]] 
20 For the second time that day, [[H8145]] the twenty-fourth [[H6242]] day of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Haggai, [[H2292]] saying: [[H559]] 
21 “Tell [[H559]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] governor [[H6346]] of Judah [[H3063]] [that] [[H559]] I [[H589]] am about to shake [[H7493]] the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth: [[H776]] 
22 I will overturn [[H2015]] royal [[H4467]] thrones [[H3678]] and destroy [[H8045]] the power [[H2392]] of the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the nations. [[H1471]] I will overturn [[H2015]] chariots [[H4818]] and their riders; [[H7392]] horses [[H5483]] and their riders [[H7392]] will fall, [[H3381]] each [[H376]] by the sword [[H2719]] of his brother. [[H251]] 
23 On that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] I will take you, [[H3947]] My servant, [[H5650]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and I will make you [[H7760]] like My signet ring, [[H2368]] for [[H3588]] I have chosen you, [[H977]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts.” [[H6635]]
