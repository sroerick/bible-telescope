# Galatians 6
[[Galatians 5|←]] • [[Ephesians 1|→]]
1 Brothers, [[G80]] if [[G1437]] someone [[G444]] is caught [[G4301]] in [[G1722]] a [[G5100]] trespass, [[G3900]] you [[G4771]] who are [[G3588]] spiritual [[G4152]] should restore [[G2675]] him [[G5108]] with [[G1722]] a spirit [[G4151]] of gentleness. [[G4240]] [But] watch [[G4648]] yourself, [[G4572]] or [[G3361]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] may be tempted. [[G3985]] 
2 Carry [[G941]] one another’s [[G240]] burdens, [[G922]] and [[G2532]] in this way [[G3779]] you will fulfill [[G378]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of Christ. [[G5547]] 
3 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] thinks [[G1380]] he is [[G1510]] something [[G5100]] when he is [[G1510]] nothing, [[G3367]] he deceives [[G5422]] himself. [[G1438]] 
4 Each one [[G1538]] should test [[G1381]] his own [[G1438]] work. [[G2041]] Then [[G5119]] he will have [[G2192]] reason to boast [[G2745]] in [[G1519]] himself [[G1438]] alone, [[G3441]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1519]] someone else. [[G2087]] 
5 For [[G1063]] each one [[G1538]] should carry [[G941]] his own [[G2398]] load. [[G5413]] 
6 However, [[G1161]] the one who [[G3588]] receives instruction [[G2727]] in the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] must share [[G2841]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] good things [[G18]] with [his] [[G3588]] instructor. [[G2727]] 
7 {Do} not [[G3361]] be deceived: [[G4105]] God [[G2316]] cannot be mocked. [[G3456]] Whatever [[G3739]] a man [[G444]] sows, [[G4687]] he will reap in return. [[G2325]] 
8 The [one] [[G3588]] who sows [[G4687]] to please [[G1519]] his [[G1438]] flesh, [[G4561]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] will reap [[G2325]] destruction; [[G5356]] but [[G1161]] the [one] [[G3588]] who sows [[G4687]] to please [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] will reap [[G2325]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]] 
9 Let us not grow weary [[G1573]] [in] well-doing, [[G2570]] for [[G1063]] in due [[G2398]] time [[G2540]] we will reap a harvest, [[G2325]] if we do not give up. [[G1590]] 
10 Therefore, [[G3767]] as [[G5613]] we have [[G2192]] opportunity, [[G2540]] let us do [[G2038]] good [[G18]] to [[G4314]] everyone, [[G3956]] and [[G1161]] especially [[G3122]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] family [[G3609]] of [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] 
11 See [[G3708]] [what] large [[G4080]] letters [[G1121]] I am using to write [[G1125]] to you [[G4771]] with [[G3588]] my own [[G1699]] hand! [[G5495]] 
12 Those who [[G3745]] want [[G2309]] to make a good impression [[G2146]] outwardly [[G4561]] are trying to compel [[G315]] you [[G4771]] to be circumcised. [[G4059]] [They] only [ do this ] [[G3440]] to [[G2443]] avoid [[G3361]] persecution [[G1377]] for the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of Christ. [[G5547]] 
13 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] circumcised [[G4059]] {do} not even [[G3761]] keep [[G5442]] [the] Law [[G3551]] themselves, [[G846]] yet [[G235]] they want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be circumcised [[G4059]] that [[G2443]] they may boast [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5212]] flesh. [[G4561]] 
14 But [[G1161]] as for me, [[G1473]] may [[G1096]] {I} never [[G3361]] boast, [[G2744]] except [[G1487]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] through [[G1223]] which [[G3739]] [the] world [[G2889]] has been crucified [[G4717]] to me, [[G1473]] and I [[G2504]] [to the] world. [[G2889]] 
15 For [[G1063]] neither [[G3777]] circumcision [[G4061]] nor [[G3777]] uncircumcision [[G203]] means [[G1510]] anything. [[G5100]] [What counts is] [[G235]] a new [[G2537]] creation. [[G2937]] 
16 Peace [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] mercy [[G1656]] to [[G1909]] all [[G3745]] who [[G3588]] walk [[G4748]] by this [[G3778]] rule, [[G2583]] even [[G2532]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Israel [[G2474]] of God. [[G2316]] 
17 From now on [[G3064]] {let} no one [[G3367]] cause [[G3930]] me [[G1473]] trouble, [[G2873]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] bear [[G941]] on [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] body [[G4983]] the [[G3588]] marks [[G4742]] of Jesus. [[G2424]] 
18 The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [be] with [[G3326]] your [[G4771]] spirit, [[G4151]] brothers. [[G80]] Amen. [[G281]]
