# Galatians 5
[[Galatians 4|←]] • [[Galatians 6|→]]
1 [It is] for [[G3588]] freedom [[G1657]] [that] Christ [[G5547]] has set us free. [[G1659]] Stand firm, [[G4739]] then, [[G3767]] and [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] be encumbered [[G1758]] once more [[G3825]] by a yoke [[G2218]] of slavery. [[G1397]] 
2 Take notice: [[G2400]] I, [[G1473]] Paul, [[G3972]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] you let yourselves be circumcised, [[G4059]] Christ [[G5547]] will be of no value [[G5623]] to you {at all}. [[G4771]] 
3 Again [[G3825]] I testify [[G3143]] to every [[G3956]] man [[G444]] who gets himself circumcised [[G4059]] that [[G3754]] he is [[G1510]] obligated [[G3781]] to obey [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] Law. [[G3551]] 
4 {You} who [[G3748]] are [trying] to be justified [[G1344]] by [[G1722]] [the] Law [[G3551]] have been severed [[G2673]] from [[G575]] Christ; [[G5547]] you have fallen away [[G1601]] from [[G3588]] grace. [[G5485]] 
5 [But] [[G1063]] by [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] we [[G1473]] eagerly await [[G553]] through [the] Spirit [[G4151]] [the] hope [[G1680]] of righteousness. [[G1343]] 
6 For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] neither [[G3777]] circumcision [[G4061]] nor [[G3777]] uncircumcision [[G203]] has any value. [[G2480]] All that matters is [[G235]] faith, [[G4102]] expressed [[G1754]] through [[G1223]] love. [[G26]] 
7 You were running [[G5143]] so well. [[G2573]] Who [[G5101]] has obstructed [[G1465]] you [[G4771]] from obeying [[G3982]] the [[G3588]] truth? [[G225]] 
8 [Such] [[G3588]] persuasion [[G3988]] [does] not [come] [[G3756]] from [[G1537]] the [One] [[G3588]] who calls [[G2564]] you. [[G4771]] 
9 A little [[G3398]] yeast [[G2219]] leavens [[G2220]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] batch [of dough]. [[G5445]] 
10 I [[G1473]] am confident [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] that [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] will take no other view. [[G5426]] The [one who is] [[G3588]] troubling [[G5015]] you [[G4771]] will bear [[G941]] the [[G3588]] judgment, [[G2917]] whoever [[G3748]] he may be. [[G1510]] 
11 Now, [[G1161]] brothers, [[G80]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] {am} still [[G2089]] preaching [[G2784]] circumcision, [[G4061]] why [[G5101]] am I still being persecuted? [[G1377]] In that case [[G686]] the [[G3588]] offense [[G4625]] of the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] has been abolished. [[G2673]] 
12 As for those who [[G3588]] are agitating [[G387]] you, [[G4771]] I wish [[G3785]] they would proceed to emasculate themselves! [[G609]] 
13 For [[G1063]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] were called [[G2564]] to [[G1909]] freedom; [[G1657]] but [[G3440]] [do] not [use] [[G3361]] [your] [[G3588]] freedom [[G1657]] as [[G1519]] an opportunity [[G874]] for the [[G3588]] flesh. [[G4561]] Rather, [[G235]] serve [[G1398]] one another [[G240]] in [[G1223]] love. [[G26]] 
14 The [[G3588]] entire [[G3956]] Law [[G3551]] is fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] a single [[G1520]] decree: [[G3056]] “Love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] neighbor [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] yourself.” [[G4572]] 
15 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you keep on biting [[G1143]] and [[G2532]] devouring [[G2719]] each other, [[G240]] watch out, [[G991]] [or] [[G3361]] you will be consumed [[G355]] by [[G5259]] each other. [[G240]] 
16 So [[G1161]] I say, [[G3004]] walk [[G4043]] by [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] you will not gratify [[G5055]] [the] desires [[G1939]] [of the] flesh. [[G4561]] 
17 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] craves [[G1937]] what is contrary [[G2596]] to the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] what is contrary [[G2596]] to the [[G3588]] flesh. [[G4561]] [They] [[G3778]] are opposed [[G480]] to one another, [[G240]] so that [[G2443]] you do not do [[G4160]] what [[G3778]] you want. [[G2309]] 
18 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you are led by [[G71]] [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] you are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] under [[G5259]] [the] Law. [[G3551]] 
19 The [[G3588]] acts [[G2041]] of the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] are [[G1510]] obvious: [[G5318]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] impurity, [[G167]] [and] debauchery; [[G766]] 
20 idolatry [[G1495]] [and] sorcery; [[G5331]] hatred, [[G2189]] discord, [[G2054]] jealousy, [[G2205]] [and] rage; [[G2372]] rivalries, [[G2052]] divisions, [[G1370]] factions, [[G139]] 
21 [and] envy; [[G5355]] drunkenness, [[G3178]] carousing, [[G2970]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] like. [[G3664]] I warn [[G4302]] you, [[G4771]] as [[G2531]] I did before, [[G4302]] that [[G3754]] those [[G3588]] who practice [[G4238]] such [[G3588]] things [[G5108]] will not inherit [[G2816]] [the] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]] 
22 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] is [[G1510]] love, [[G26]] joy, [[G5479]] peace, [[G1515]] patience, [[G3115]] kindness, [[G5544]] goodness, [[G19]] faithfulness, [[G4102]] 
23 gentleness, [[G4240]] [and] self-control. [[G1466]] Against [[G2596]] such [[G5108]] things [[G3588]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] Law. [[G3551]] 
24 Those [[G3588]] who [belong to] [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] have crucified [[G4717]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] with [[G4862]] [its] [[G3588]] passions [[G3804]] and [[G2532]] desires. [[G1939]] 
25 Since [[G1487]] we live [[G2198]] by [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] let us walk in step [[G4748]] with [the] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
26 Let us not become [[G1096]] conceited, [[G2755]] provoking [[G4292]] [and] envying [[G5354]] one another. [[G240]]
