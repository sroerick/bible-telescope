# Galatians 3
[[Galatians 2|←]] • [[Galatians 4|→]]
1 O [[G5599]] foolish [[G453]] Galatians! [[G1052]] Who [[G5101]] has bewitched [[G940]] you? [[G4771]] Before [[G2596]] [your] [[G3739]] eyes [[G3788]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] was clearly portrayed [[G4270]] [as] crucified. [[G4717]] 
2 I would like [[G2309]] to learn [[G3129]] just [[G3440]] [one thing] [[G3778]] from [[G575]] you: [[G4771]] Did you receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] by [[G1537]] works [[G2041]] of the Law, [[G3551]] or [[G2228]] by [[G1537]] hearing [[G189]] with faith? [[G4102]] 
3 Are you [[G1510]] so [[G3779]] foolish? [[G453]] After starting [[G1728]] in [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] are you now finishing [[G2005]] in [the] flesh? [[G4561]] 
4 Have you suffered [[G3958]] so much [[G5118]] for nothing, [[G1500]] if [[G1487]] it really was [[G1065]] for nothing? [[G1500]] 
5 {Does} [God] [[G3588]] lavish [[G2023]] [His] [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] on you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] work [[G1754]] miracles [[G1411]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] because [you] [[G1537]] practice [[G2041]] the Law, [[G3551]] or [[G2228]] because [you] [[G1537]] hear [[G189]] [and] believe? [[G4102]] 
6 So also, [[G2531]] “Abraham [[G11]] believed [[G4100]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] it was credited [[G3049]] to him [[G846]] as [[G1519]] righteousness.” [[G1343]] 
7 Understand, [[G1097]] then, [[G686]] that [[G3754]] those who [[G3588]] have [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] are [[G1510]] [the] sons [[G5207]] of Abraham. [[G11]] 
8 The [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] foresaw [[G4308]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] would justify [[G1344]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] by [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] [and] foretold the gospel [[G4283]] to Abraham: [[G11]] “All [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] will be blessed [[G1757]] through [[G1722]] you.” [[G4771]] 
9 So [[G5620]] those who [[G3588]] have [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] are blessed [[G2127]] along with [[G4862]] Abraham, [[G11]] the [man] [[G3588]] of faith. [[G4103]] 
10 All who [[G3745]] rely on [[G1510]] works [[G2041]] of the Law [[G3551]] are [[G1510]] under [[G5259]] a curse. [[G2671]] For [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] “Cursed [is] [[G1944]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3739]] does not continue [[G1696]] to do [[G4160]] everything [[G3956]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Book [[G975]] of the [[G3588]] Law. [[G3551]] 
11 And [[G1161]] it is clear [[G1212]] that [[G3754]] no one [[G3762]] is justified [[G1344]] before [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1722]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] because, [[G3754]] “The [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] will live [[G2198]] by [[G1537]] faith.” [[G4102]] 
12 The [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] however, [[G1161]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] based [[G1537]] on faith; [[G4102]] on the contrary, [[G235]] “The [man who] [[G3588]] does [[G4160]] these things [[G846]] will live [[G2198]] by [[G1722]] them.” [[G846]] 
13 Christ [[G5547]] redeemed [[G1805]] us [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] curse [[G2671]] of the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] by becoming [[G1096]] a curse [[G2671]] for [[G5228]] us. [[G1473]] For [[G3754]] it is written: [[G1125]] “Cursed [is] [[G1944]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] is hung [[G2910]] on [[G1909]] a tree.” [[G3586]] 
14 [He redeemed us] in order that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] blessing promised [[G2129]] to Abraham [[G11]] would come [[G1096]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] so that [[G2443]] by [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] we might receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
15 Brothers, [[G80]] let me put this [[G3004]] in human terms. [[G2596]] Even [[G3676]] a human covenant, [[G1242]] once it is ratified, [[G2964]] cannot [[G3762]] be canceled [[G114]] or [[G2228]] amended. [[G1928]] 
16 The [[G3588]] promises [[G1860]] were spoken [[G2046]] to Abraham [[G11]] and [[G2532]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] seed. [[G4690]] [The Scripture ] does not say, [[G3004]] “and [[G2532]] to seeds,” [[G4690]] meaning [[G1909]] many, [[G4183]] but [[G235]] “and [[G2532]] to [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] seed,” [[G4690]] meaning [[G1909]] One, [[G1520]] who [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
17 What I mean [[G3004]] [is] this: [[G3778]] [The] Law [[G3551]] that came [[G1096]] 430 {} [[G5071]] years [[G2094]] later [[G3326]] does not revoke [[G208]] [the] covenant [[G1242]] previously established [[G4300]] by [[G5259]] God, [[G2316]] so as [[G1519]] to cancel [[G2673]] the [[G3588]] promise. [[G1860]] 
18 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] inheritance [[G2817]] depends on [[G1537]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] [then it] no longer [[G3765]] depends on [[G1537]] a promise; [[G1860]] but [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] freely granted [it] [[G5483]] to Abraham [[G11]] through [[G1223]] a promise. [[G1860]] 
19 Why [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] [ was ] the [[G3588]] Law [ given ]? [[G3551]] It was added [[G4369]] because of [[G5484]] transgressions, [[G3847]] until [[G891]] [the] arrival [[G2064]] of the [[G3588]] seed [[G4690]] to whom [[G3739]] [the] promise referred. [[G1861]] It was administered [[G1299]] through [[G1223]] angels [[G32]] by [[G1722]] a mediator. [[G3316]] 
20 A mediator [[G3316]] is [[G1510]] unnecessary, [[G3756]] however, [[G1161]] [ if there is only ] one [ party ]; [[G1520]] but [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] one. [[G1520]] 
21 [Is] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] then, [[G3767]] opposed to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] promises [[G1860]] of God? [[G2316]] Absolutely not! [[G1096]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] a law [[G3551]] had been given [[G1325]] that [[G3588]] could [[G1410]] impart life, [[G2227]] then [[G302]] righteousness [[G1343]] {would} certainly [[G3689]] have come [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] [the] Law. [[G3551]] 
22 But [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [ pronounces ] [[G1124]] all [[G3956]] things [[G3588]] confined [[G4788]] by [[G5259]] sin, [[G266]] so that [[G2443]] by [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] in Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] might be given [[G1325]] to those who [[G3588]] believe. [[G4100]] 
23 Before [[G4253]] [this] [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] came, [[G2064]] we were held in custody [[G5432]] under [[G5259]] the Law, [[G3551]] locked up [[G4788]] until [[G1519]] faith [[G4102]] should be [[G3195]] revealed. [[G601]] 
24 So [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] became [[G1096]] our [[G1473]] guardian [[G3807]] to lead us [[G1519]] to Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] we might be justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] faith. [[G4102]] 
25 Now [[G1161]] [that] [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] has come, [[G2064]] we are [[G1510]] no longer [[G3765]] under [[G5259]] a guardian. [[G3807]] 
26 You are [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] sons [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
27 For [[G1063]] all of [[G3745]] you [who] were baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] have clothed yourselves with [[G1746]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
28 There is [[G1762]] neither [[G3756]] Jew [[G2453]] nor [[G3761]] Greek, [[G1672]] slave [[G1401]] nor [[G3761]] free, [[G1658]] male [[G730]] [nor] [[G2532]] female, [[G2338]] for [[G1063]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] one [[G1520]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
29 And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you belong [[G4771]] to Christ, [[G5547]] then [[G686]] you are [[G1510]] Abraham’s [[G11]] seed [[G4690]] [and] heirs [[G2818]] according to [[G2596]] [the] promise. [[G1860]]
