# Galatians 2
[[Galatians 1|←]] • [[Galatians 3|→]]
1 Fourteen [[G1180]] years [[G2094]] later [[G1223]] I went up [[G305]] again [[G3825]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] accompanied by [[G3326]] Barnabas. [[G921]] I took [[G4838]] Titus {along} [[G5103]] also. [[G2532]] 
2 I went [[G305]] in response to [[G2596]] a revelation [[G602]] and [[G2532]] set before [[G394]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] that [[G3739]] I preach [[G2784]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]] But [[G1161]] [I spoke] privately [[G2398]] to those [[G3588]] recognized as leaders, [[G1380]] [for fear that] [[G4459]] I was running [[G5143]] or [[G2228]] had already run [[G5143]] in [[G1519]] vain. [[G2756]] 
3 Yet [[G235]] not even [[G3761]] Titus, [[G5103]] who [was] [[G3588]] with [[G4862]] me, [[G1473]] was compelled [[G315]] to be circumcised, [[G4059]] [even though] he was [[G1510]] a Greek. [[G1672]] 
4 [This issue arose] [[G1161]] because [[G1223]] [some] [[G3588]] false brothers [[G5569]] were brought in [[G3922]] under false pretenses [[G3920]] to spy on [[G2684]] our [[G1473]] freedom [[G1657]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] in order [[G2443]] to enslave [[G2615]] us. [[G1473]] 
5 We did {not} give in [[G1502]] to [them] [[G3739]] for [[G4314]] a moment, [[G5610]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] of the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] would remain [[G1265]] with [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]] 
6 But [[G1161]] as for [[G575]] the [[G3588]] highly esteemed, [[G1380]] whatever [[G3697]] they were [[G1510]] makes no difference [[G1308]] to me; [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] does not show favoritism. [[G2983]] For [[G1063]] those [[G3588]] [leaders] [[G1380]] added [[G4323]] nothing [[G3762]] to my [message]. [[G1473]] 
7 On the contrary, [[G5121]] they saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] I had been entrusted {to preach} [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G203]] just as [[G2531]] Peter [ had been ] [[G4074]] to the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G4061]] 
8 For [[G1063]] [God], who [[G3588]] was at work [[G1754]] in Peter’s [[G4074]] apostleship [[G651]] to the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G4061]] was also at work [[G1754]] in my [apostleship] [[G1473]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]] 
9 And [[G2532]] recognizing [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] I [[G1473]] had been given, [[G1325]] James, [[G2385]] Cephas, [[G2786]] and [[G2532]] John— [[G2491]] those [[G3588]] reputed [[G1380]] to be [[G1510]] pillars— [[G4769]] gave [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of fellowship, [[G2842]] so that [[G2443]] we [ should go ] [[G1473]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] and [[G1161]] they [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G4061]] 
10 [They] only [asked us] [[G3440]] to [[G2443]] be mindful [[G3421]] of the [[G3588]] poor, [[G4434]] the very [[G846]] thing [[G3778]] I was eager [[G4704]] to do. [[G4160]] 
11 When [[G3753]] Cephas [[G2786]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Antioch, [[G490]] however, [[G1161]] I opposed [him] [[G436]] to [[G2596]] his [[G846]] face, [[G4383]] because [[G3754]] he stood [[G1510]] to be condemned. [[G2607]] 
12 For [[G1063]] before [[G4253]] certain men [[G5100]] came [[G2064]] from [[G575]] James, [[G2385]] he used to eat [[G4906]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]] But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] they arrived, [[G2064]] he began to draw back [[G5288]] and [[G2532]] separate [[G873]] himself, [[G1438]] for fear of [[G5399]] those [[G3588]] in [[G1537]] [the] circumcision [ group ]. [[G4061]] 
13 The [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] Jews [[G2453]] joined in his hypocrisy, [[G4942]] so that [[G5620]] by [[G3588]] their [[G846]] hypocrisy [[G5272]] even [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] was led astray. [[G4879]] 
14 When [[G3753]] I saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] they were not walking in line [[G3716]] with [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] of the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] I said [[G2036]] to Cephas [[G2786]] in front of [[G1715]] [them] all, [[G3956]] “If [[G1487]] you, [[G4771]] who are [[G5225]] a Jew, [[G2453]] live [[G2198]] like a Gentile [[G1483]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] like a Jew, [[G2452]] how [[G4459]] can you compel [[G315]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] to live like Jews? [[G2450]] 
15 We [who are] [[G1473]] Jews [[G2453]] by birth [[G5449]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] Gentile [[G1484]] ‘sinners’ [[G268]] 
16 know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] a man [[G444]] is not justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] works [[G2041]] of [the] Law, [[G3551]] but [[G1437]] by [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] in Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] So we, too, [[G2532]] have believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] that [[G2443]] we may be justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] in Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] works [[G2041]] of the Law, [[G3551]] because [[G3754]] by [[G1537]] works [[G2041]] of the Law [[G3551]] no one [[G3756]] will be justified. [[G1344]] 
17 But [[G1161]] if, [[G1487]] while we seek [[G2212]] to be justified [[G1344]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] we ourselves [[G846]] are found to be [[G2147]] sinners, [[G268]] does that make [[G686]] Christ [[G5547]] a minister [[G1249]] of sin? [[G266]] Absolutely not! [[G1096]] 
18 If [[G1487]] I rebuild [[G3618]] what [[G3778]] I have already torn down, [[G2647]] I prove [[G4921]] myself [[G1683]] [to be] a lawbreaker. [[G3848]] 
19 For [[G1063]] through [[G1223]] [the] Law [[G3551]] I [[G1473]] died [[G599]] to [the] Law [[G3551]] so that [[G2443]] I might live [[G2198]] to God. [[G2316]] 
20 I have been crucified with [[G4957]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] no longer [[G3765]] live, [[G2198]] but [[G1161]] Christ [[G5547]] lives [[G2198]] in [[G1722]] me. [[G1473]] The [life] [[G3739]] I live [[G2198]] in [[G1722]] [the] body, [[G4561]] I live [[G2198]] by [[G1722]] faith [[G4102]] in the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] loved [[G25]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] gave Himself up [[G3860]] for [[G5228]] me. [[G1473]] 
21 I do not set aside [[G114]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of God. [[G2316]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] righteousness [comes] [[G1343]] through [[G1223]] the Law, [[G3551]] Christ [[G5547]] died [[G599]] for nothing.” [[G1432]]
