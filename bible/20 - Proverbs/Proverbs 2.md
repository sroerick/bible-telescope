# Proverbs 2
[[Proverbs 1|←]] • [[Proverbs 3|→]]
1 My son, [[H1121]] if [[H518]] you accept [[H3947]] my words [[H561]] and hide [[H6845]] my commandments [[H4687]] within you, [[H854]] 
2 if you incline [[H7181]] your ear [[H241]] to wisdom [[H2451]] and direct [[H5186]] your heart [[H3820]] to understanding, [[H8394]] 
3 if you [[H518]] truly [[H3588]] call out [[H7121]] to insight [[H998]] and lift [[H5414]] your voice [[H6963]] to understanding, [[H8394]] 
4 if [[H518]] you seek [[H1245]] it like silver [[H3701]] and search it out [[H2664]] like hidden treasure, [[H4301]] 
5 then [[H227]] you will discern [[H995]] the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and discover [[H4672]] the knowledge [[H1847]] of God. [[H430]] 
6 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] gives [[H5414]] wisdom; [[H2451]] from His mouth [[H6310]] come knowledge [[H1847]] and understanding. [[H8394]] 
7 He stores up [[H6845]] sound wisdom [[H8454]] for the upright; [[H3477]] He is a shield [[H4043]] to those who walk [[H1980]] with integrity, [[H8537]] 
8 to guard [[H5341]] the paths [[H734]] of justice [[H4941]] and protect [[H8104]] the way [[H1870]] of His saints. [[H2623]] 
9 Then [[H227]] you will discern [[H995]] righteousness [[H6664]] and justice [[H4941]] and equity— [[H4339]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] path. [[H4570]] 
10 For [[H3588]] wisdom [[H2451]] will enter [[H935]] your heart, [[H3820]] and knowledge [[H1847]] will delight [[H5276]] your soul. [[H5315]] 
11 Discretion [[H4209]] will watch over you, [[H8104]] and understanding [[H8394]] will guard you, [[H5341]] 
12 to deliver you [[H5337]] from the way [[H1870]] of evil, [[H7451]] from the man [[H376]] who speaks [[H1696]] perversity, [[H8419]] 
13 from those who leave [[H5800]] the straight [[H3476]] paths [[H734]] to walk [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of darkness, [[H2822]] 
14 from those who enjoy [[H8056]] doing [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] and rejoice [[H1523]] in the twistedness [[H8419]] of evil, [[H7451]] 
15 whose [[H834]] paths [[H734]] are crooked, [[H6141]] and whose ways [[H4570]] are devious. [[H3868]] 
16 It will rescue you [[H5337]] from the forbidden [[H2114]] woman, [[H802]] from the stranger [[H5237]] with seductive [[H2505]] words, [[H561]] 
17 who abandons [[H5800]] the partner [[H441]] of her youth [[H5271]] and forgets [[H7911]] the covenant [[H1285]] of her God. [[H430]] 
18 For [[H3588]] her house [[H1004]] sinks down [[H7743]] to [[H413]] death, [[H4194]] and her tracks [[H4570]] to [[H413]] the departed spirits. [[H7496]] 
19 None [[H3605]] who go to her [[H935]] return [[H7725]] [or] [[H3808]] negotiate [[H5381]] the paths [[H734]] of life. [[H2416]] 
20 So [[H4616]] you will follow [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of good men, [[H2896]] and keep to [[H8104]] the paths [[H734]] of the righteous. [[H6662]] 
21 For [[H3588]] the upright [[H3477]] will inhabit [[H7931]] the land, [[H776]] and the blameless [[H8549]] will remain in it; [[H3498]] 
22 but the wicked [[H7563]] will be cut off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] the land, [[H776]] and the unfaithful [[H898]] {will} be uprooted. [[H5255]]
