# Proverbs 27
[[Proverbs 26|←]] • [[Proverbs 28|→]]
1 Do not [[H408]] boast [[H1984]] about tomorrow, [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] you do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] a day [[H3117]] may bring. [[H3205]] 
2 Let another [[H2114]] praise you, [[H1984]] and not [[H3808]] your own mouth— [[H6310]] a stranger, [[H5237]] and not [[H408]] your own lips. [[H8193]] 
3 A stone [[H68]] is heavy [[H3514]] and sand [[H2344]] [is] a burden, [[H5192]] but aggravation [[H3708]] from a fool [[H191]] outweighs [[H3515]] them both. [[H8147]] 
4 Wrath [[H2534]] [is] cruel [[H395]] and anger [[H639]] [is] like a flood, [[H7858]] but who [[H4310]] can withstand [[H5975]] jealousy? [[H7068]] 
5 Better [[H2896]] an open [[H1540]] rebuke [[H8433]] than love [[H160]] that is concealed. [[H5641]] 
6 The wounds [[H6482]] of a friend [[H157]] are faithful, [[H539]] but the kisses [[H5390]] of an enemy [[H8130]] [are] deceitful. [[H6280]] 
7 The soul [[H5315]] that is full [[H7649]] loathes [[H947]] honey, [[H5317]] but to a hungry [[H7457]] soul, [[H5315]] any [[H3605]] bitter thing [[H4751]] is sweet. [[H4966]] 
8 Like a bird [[H6833]] that strays [[H5074]] from its nest [[H7064]] [is] a man [[H376]] who wanders [[H5074]] from [[H4480]] his home. [[H4725]] 
9 Oil [[H8081]] and incense [[H7004]] bring joy [[H8055]] to the heart, [[H3820]] and the sweetness [[H4986]] of a friend [[H7453]] [is] counsel [[H6098]] to the soul. [[H5315]] 
10 Do not [[H408]] forsake [[H5800]] your friend [[H7453]] or your father’s [[H1]] friend, [[H7463]] and do not [[H408]] go [[H935]] to your brother’s [[H251]] house [[H1004]] in the day [[H3117]] of your calamity; [[H343]] better [[H2896]] a neighbor [[H7934]] nearby [[H7138]] than a brother [[H251]] far away. [[H7350]] 
11 Be wise, [[H2449]] my son, [[H1121]] and bring joy [[H8056]] to my heart, [[H3820]] so that I can answer [[H7725]] him who taunts me. [[H2778]] 
12 The prudent [[H6175]] see [[H7200]] danger [[H7451]] and take cover; [[H5641]] [but] the simple [[H6612]] keep going [[H5674]] [and] pay the penalty. [[H6064]] 
13 Take [[H3947]] the garment [[H899]] of him who [[H3588]] posts security [[H6148]] for a stranger; [[H2114]] get collateral [[H2254]] if it is for [[H1157]] a wayward woman. [[H5237]] 
14 If one blesses [[H1288]] his neighbor [[H7453]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice [[H6963]] early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] it will be counted [[H2803]] to him  as a curse. [[H7045]] 
15 A constant [[H2956]] dripping [[H1812]] on a rainy [[H5464]] day [[H3117]] and a contentious [[H4066]] woman [[H802]] are alike— [[H7737]] 
16 restraining her [[H6845]] is like holding back [[H6845]] the wind [[H7307]] or grasping [[H7121]] oil [[H8081]] with one’s right hand. [[H3225]] 
17 As iron [[H1270]] sharpens [[H2300]] iron, [[H1270]] so one man [[H376]] sharpens [[H2300]] another. [[H7453]] 
18 Whoever tends [[H5341]] a fig tree [[H8384]] will eat [[H398]] its fruit, [[H6529]] and he who looks after [[H8104]] his master [[H113]] will be honored. [[H3513]] 
19 As water [[H4325]] reflects the face, [[H6440]] so [[H3651]] the heart [[H3820]] reflects the true man. [[H120]] 
20 Sheol [[H7585]] and Abaddon [[H10]] are never [[H3808]] satisfied; [[H7646]] so the eyes [[H5869]] of man [[H120]] are never [[H3808]] satisfied. [[H7646]] 
21 A crucible [[H4715]] for silver [[H3701]] and a furnace [[H3564]] for gold, [[H2091]] but a man [is tested] [[H376]] by the praise [[H4110]] accorded him. [[H6310]] 
22 Though [[H518]] you grind [[H3806]] a fool [[H191]] in a mortar [[H4388]] with a pestle [[H5940]] along with [[H8432]] grain, [[H7383]] [yet] his folly [[H200]] will not [[H3808]] depart [[H5493]] from him. [[H5921]] 
23 Be sure to know [[H3045]] the state [[H6440]] of your flocks, [[H6629]] and pay close attention [[H7896]] to your herds; [[H5739]] 
24 for [[H3588]] riches [[H2633]] [are] not [[H3808]] forever, [[H5769]] nor does [[H518]] a crown [[H5145]] [endure] to every [[H1755]] generation. [[H1755]] 
25 When hay [[H2682]] is removed [[H1540]] and new growth [[H1877]] appears [[H7200]] and the grain [[H6212]] from the hills [[H2022]] is gathered, [[H622]] 
26 the lambs [[H3532]] will provide you with clothing, [[H3830]] and the goats [[H6260]] with the price [[H4242]] of a field. [[H7704]] 
27 You will have plenty [[H1767]] of goats’ [[H5795]] milk [[H2461]] to feed you— [[H3899]] food [[H3899]] for your household [[H1004]] and nourishment [[H2416]] for your maidservants. [[H5291]]
