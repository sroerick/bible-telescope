# Proverbs 23
[[Proverbs 22|←]] • [[Proverbs 24|→]]
1 When [[H3588]] you sit down [[H3427]] to dine [[H3898]] with [[H854]] a ruler, [[H4910]] consider [[H995]] carefully [[H995]] what [[H834]] is set before you, [[H6440]] 
2 and put [[H7760]] a knife [[H7915]] to your throat [[H3930]] if [[H518]] you [[H859]] possess [[H1167]] a [great] appetite. [[H5315]] 
3 Do not [[H408]] crave [[H183]] his delicacies, [[H4303]] for that [[H1931]] food [[H3899]] is deceptive. [[H3577]] 
4 Do not [[H408]] wear yourself out [[H3021]] to get rich; [[H6238]] be wise enough [[H998]] to restrain yourself. [[H2308]] 
5 When you glance [at wealth], [[H5774]] it disappears, [[H369]] for [[H3588]] it makes [[H6213]] wings for itself [[H3671]] and flies [[H5774]] like an eagle [[H5404]] to the sky. [[H8064]] 
6 Do not [[H408]] eat [[H3898]] the bread [[H3899]] of a stingy man [[H7451]] [or] [[H408]] crave [[H183]] his delicacies, [[H4303]] 
7 for [[H3588]] he is keeping track, [[H8176]] inwardly [[H5315]] [counting the cost]. [[H3651]] “Eat [[H398]] and drink,” [[H8354]] he says to you, [[H559]] but his heart [[H3820]] is not [[H1077]] with you. [[H5973]] 
8 You will vomit up [[H6958]] what little [[H6595]] you have eaten [[H398]] and waste [[H7843]] your pleasant [[H5273]] words. [[H1697]] 
9 Do not [[H408]] speak [[H1696]] to a fool, [[H3684]] for [[H3588]] he will despise [[H936]] the wisdom [[H7922]] of your words. [[H4405]] 
10 Do not [[H408]] move [[H5253]] an ancient [[H5769]] boundary stone [[H1366]] [or] [[H408]] encroach [[H935]] on the fields [[H7704]] of the fatherless, [[H3490]] 
11 for [[H3588]] their Redeemer [[H1350]] is strong; [[H2389]] He [[H1931]] will take up [[H7378]] their case [[H7379]] against you. [[H854]] 
12 Apply [[H935]] your heart [[H3820]] to instruction [[H4148]] and your ears [[H241]] to words [[H561]] of knowledge. [[H1847]] 
13 Do not [[H408]] withhold [[H4513]] discipline [[H4148]] from a child; [[H5288]] although [[H3588]] you strike him [[H5221]] with a rod, [[H7626]] he will not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] 
14 Strike him [[H5221]] with a rod, [[H7626]] and you will deliver [[H5337]] his soul [[H5315]] from Sheol. [[H7585]] 
15 My son, [[H1121]] if [[H518]] your heart [[H3820]] is wise, [[H2449]] my own heart [[H3820]] will indeed [[H1571]] rejoice. [[H8055]] 
16 My inmost being [[H3629]] will rejoice [[H5937]] when your lips [[H8193]] speak [[H1696]] what is right. [[H4339]] 
17 Do not [[H408]] let your heart [[H3820]] envy [[H7065]] sinners, [[H2400]] but [[H3588]] always continue [[H3605]] in the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
18 For [[H3588]] surely [[H518]] there is [[H3426]] a future, [[H319]] and your hope [[H8615]] will not [[H3808]] be cut off. [[H3772]] 
19 Listen, [[H8085]] my son, [[H1121]] and be wise, [[H2449]] and guide [[H833]] your heart [[H3820]] on the right course. [[H1870]] 
20 Do not [[H408]] join [[H1961]] those who drink too much [[H5433]] wine [[H3196]] or gorge [[H2151]] themselves on meat. [[H1320]] 
21 For [[H3588]] the drunkard [[H5433]] and the glutton [[H2151]] will come to poverty, [[H3423]] and drowsiness [[H5124]] will clothe [[H3847]] them in rags. [[H7168]] 
22 Listen [[H8085]] to your father [[H1]] who [[H2088]] gave you life, [[H3205]] and do not [[H408]] despise [[H936]] your mother [[H517]] when [[H3588]] she is old. [[H2204]] 
23 Invest in [[H7069]] truth [[H571]] and never [[H408]] sell it— [[H4376]] in wisdom [[H2451]] and instruction [[H4148]] and understanding. [[H998]] 
24 The father [[H1]] of a righteous man [[H6662]] will greatly rejoice, [[H1523]] and he who fathers [[H3205]] a wise son [[H2450]] will delight in him. [[H8055]] 
25 May your father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] be glad, [[H8055]] and may she who gave you birth [[H3205]] rejoice! [[H1523]] 
26 My son, [[H1121]] give [[H5414]] me your heart, [[H3820]] and let your eyes [[H5869]] delight [[H7521]] in my ways. [[H1870]] 
27 For [[H3588]] a prostitute [[H2181]] is a deep [[H6013]] pit, [[H7745]] and an adulteress [[H5237]] is a narrow [[H6862]] well. [[H875]] 
28 Like a robber [[H2863]] she [[H1931]] lies in wait [[H693]] and multiplies [[H3254]] the faithless [[H898]] among men. [[H120]] 
29 Who [[H4310]] has woe? [[H188]] Who [[H4310]] has sorrow? [[H17]] Who [[H4310]] has contentions? [[H4066]] Who [[H4310]] has complaints? [[H7879]] Who [[H4310]] {has} needless [[H2600]] wounds? [[H6482]] Who [[H4310]] has bloodshot [[H2448]] eyes? [[H5869]] 
30 Those who linger [[H309]] over [[H5921]] wine, [[H3196]] those who go [[H935]] to taste [[H2713]] mixed drinks. [[H4469]] 
31 Do not [[H408]] gaze at [[H7200]] wine [[H3196]] while [[H3588]] it is red, [[H119]] when [[H3588]] it sparkles [[H5414]] in the cup [[H3599]] and goes down smoothly. [[H1980]] 
32 In the end [[H319]] it bites [[H5391]] like a snake [[H5175]] and stings [[H6567]] like a viper. [[H6848]] 
33 Your eyes [[H5869]] will see [[H7200]] strange things, [[H2114]] and your mind [[H3820]] will utter [[H1696]] perversities. [[H8419]] 
34 You will be [[H1961]] like one sleeping [[H7901]] on the high seas [[H3220]] or lying [[H7901]] on the top [[H7218]] of a mast: [[H2260]] 
35 “They struck me, [[H5221]] but I feel no [[H1077]] pain! [[H2470]] They beat me, [[H1986]] but I did not [[H1077]] know it! [[H3045]] When [[H4970]] can I wake up [[H6974]] to search for [[H1245]] another [[H3254]] drink?” [[H5750]]
