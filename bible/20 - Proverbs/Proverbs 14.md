# Proverbs 14
[[Proverbs 13|←]] • [[Proverbs 15|→]]
1 Every wise [[H2454]] woman [[H802]] builds [[H1129]] her house, [[H1004]] but a foolish one [[H200]] tears it down [[H2040]] with her own hands. [[H3027]] 
2 He who walks [[H1980]] in uprightness [[H3476]] fears [[H3373]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but the one who is devious [[H3868]] in his ways [[H1870]] despises Him. [[H959]] 
3 The proud [[H1346]] speech [[H6310]] of a fool [[H191]] brings a rod to his back, [[H2415]] but the lips [[H8193]] of the wise [[H2450]] protect them. [[H8104]] 
4 Where there are no [[H369]] oxen, [[H504]] the manger [[H18]] is empty, [[H1249]] but an abundant [[H7230]] harvest comes [[H8393]] through the strength [[H3581]] of the ox. [[H7794]] 
5 An honest [[H529]] witness [[H5707]] does not [[H3808]] deceive, [[H3576]] but a dishonest [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] pours forth [[H6315]] lies. [[H3577]] 
6 A mocker [[H3887]] seeks [[H1245]] wisdom [[H2451]] and [finds] none, [[H369]] but knowledge [[H1847]] comes easily [[H7043]] to the discerning. [[H995]] 
7 Stay away [[H1980]] from [[H5048]] a foolish [[H3684]] man; [[H376]] you will gain [[H3045]] no [[H1077]] knowledge [[H1847]] from his speech. [[H8193]] 
8 The wisdom [[H2451]] of the prudent [[H6175]] is to discern [[H995]] his way, [[H1870]] but the folly [[H200]] of fools [[H3684]] deceives them. [[H4820]] 
9 Fools [[H191]] mock [[H3887]] the making of amends, [[H817]] but goodwill is found [[H7522]] among [[H996]] the upright. [[H3477]] 
10 The heart [[H3820]] knows [[H3045]] its own [[H5315]] bitterness, [[H4751]] and no [[H3808]] stranger [[H2114]] shares [[H6148]] in its joy. [[H8057]] 
11 The house [[H1004]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will be destroyed, [[H8045]] but the tent [[H168]] of the upright [[H3477]] will flourish. [[H6524]] 
12 There is [[H3426]] a way [[H1870]] that seems right [[H3477]] to [[H6440]] a man, [[H376]] but its end [[H319]] is the way [[H1870]] of death. [[H4194]] 
13 Even [[H1571]] in laughter [[H7814]] the heart [[H3820]] may ache, [[H3510]] and joy [[H8057]] may end [[H319]] in sorrow. [[H8424]] 
14 The backslider [[H5472]] in heart [[H3820]] will have the fill [[H7646]] of his own ways, [[H1870]] but a good [[H2896]] man [[H376]] [will be rewarded] for his. [[H5921]] 
15 The simple [man] [[H6612]] believes [[H539]] every [[H3605]] word, [[H1697]] but the prudent man [[H6175]] watches [[H995]] his steps. [[H838]] 
16 A wise [[H2450]] [man] fears [[H3373]] and turns [[H5493]] from evil, [[H7451]] but a fool [[H3684]] is careless [[H5674]] and reckless. [[H982]] 
17 A quick-tempered man [[H7116]] acts [[H6213]] foolishly, [[H200]] and a devious [[H4209]] man [[H376]] is hated. [[H8130]] 
18 The simple [[H6612]] inherit [[H5157]] folly, [[H200]] but the prudent [[H6175]] are crowned [[H3803]] with knowledge. [[H1847]] 
19 The evil [[H7451]] bow [[H7817]] before [[H6440]] the good, [[H2896]] and the wicked [[H7563]] at [[H5921]] the gates [[H8179]] of the righteous. [[H6662]] 
20 The poor [man] [[H7326]] is hated [[H8130]] even [[H1571]] by his neighbor, [[H7453]] but many are those [[H7227]] who love [[H157]] the rich. [[H6223]] 
21 He who despises [[H936]] his neighbor [[H7453]] sins, [[H2398]] but blessed is [[H835]] he who shows kindness [[H2603]] to the poor. [[H6041]] 
22 Do not [[H3808]] those who contrive [[H2790]] evil [[H7451]] go astray? [[H8582]] But those who plan [[H2790]] goodness find [[H2896]] loving devotion [[H2617]] and truth. [[H571]] 
23 There is [[H1961]] profit [[H4195]] in all [[H3605]] labor, [[H6089]] but mere talk [[H1697]] leads only [[H389]] to poverty. [[H4270]] 
24 The crown [[H5850]] of the wise [[H2450]] is their wealth, [[H6239]] [but] the effort [[H200]] of fools [[H3684]] [is] folly. [[H200]] 
25 A truthful [[H571]] witness [[H5707]] saves [[H5337]] lives, [[H5315]] but one who utters [[H6315]] lies [[H3577]] is deceitful. [[H4820]] 
26 He who fears [[H3374]] the LORD [[H3069]] is secure [[H5797]] in confidence, [[H4009]] and his children [[H1121]] shall have [[H1961]] a place of refuge. [[H4268]] 
27 The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is a fountain [[H4726]] of life, [[H2416]] turning [a man] [[H5493]] from the snares [[H4170]] of death. [[H4194]] 
28 A large [[H7230]] population [[H5971]] is a king’s [[H4428]] splendor, [[H1927]] but a lack [[H657]] of subjects [[H3816]] is a prince’s [[H7333]] ruin. [[H4288]] 
29 A patient [man] [[H750]] has great [[H7227]] understanding, [[H8394]] but a quick-tempered [man] [[H7116]] promotes [[H7311]] folly. [[H200]] 
30 A tranquil [[H4832]] heart [[H3820]] is life [[H2416]] to the body, [[H1320]] but envy [[H7068]] rots [[H7538]] the bones. [[H6106]] 
31 He who oppresses [[H6231]] the poor [[H1800]] taunts [[H2778]] their Maker, [[H6213]] but whoever is kind [[H2603]] to the needy [[H34]] honors Him. [[H3513]] 
32 The wicked [man] [[H7563]] is thrown down [[H1760]] by his own sin, [[H7451]] but the righteous [man] [[H6662]] has a refuge [[H2620]] when he dies. [[H4194]] 
33 Wisdom [[H2451]] rests [[H5117]] in the heart [[H3820]] of the discerning; [[H995]] even in the hearts [[H7130]] of fools [[H3684]] she is known. [[H3045]] 
34 Righteousness [[H6666]] exalts [[H7311]] a nation, [[H1471]] but sin [[H2403]] is a disgrace [[H2617]] to any people. [[H3816]] 
35 A king [[H4428]] delights in [[H7522]] a wise [[H7919]] servant, [[H5650]] but his anger [[H5678]] falls [[H1961]] on the shameful. [[H954]]
