# Proverbs 31
[[Proverbs 30|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 1|→]]
1 The words [[H1697]] of King [[H4428]] Lemuel— [[H3927]] an oracle [[H4853]] that [[H834]] his mother [[H517]] taught him: [[H3256]] 
2 What [shall I say], [[H4100]] O my son? [[H1248]] What, [[H4100]] O son [[H1248]] of my womb? [[H990]] What, [[H4100]] O son [[H1248]] of my vows? [[H5088]] 
3 Do not [[H408]] spend [[H5414]] your strength [[H2428]] on women [[H802]] or your vigor [[H1870]] on those who ruin [[H4229]] kings. [[H4428]] 
4 It is not [[H408]] for kings, [[H4428]] O Lemuel, [[H3927]] it is not [[H408]] for kings [[H4428]] to drink [[H8354]] wine, [[H3196]] or for rulers [[H7336]] [to crave] [[H176]] strong drink, [[H7941]] 
5 lest [[H6435]] they drink [[H8354]] and forget [[H7911]] what is decreed, [[H2710]] and deprive [[H8138]] all [[H3605]] the oppressed [[H1121]] of justice. [[H1779]] 
6 Give [[H5414]] strong drink [[H7941]] to one who is perishing, [[H6]] and wine [[H3196]] to the bitter [[H4751]] in soul. [[H5315]] 
7 Let him drink [[H8354]] and forget [[H7911]] his poverty, [[H7389]] and remember [[H2142]] his misery [[H5999]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]] 
8 Open [[H6605]] your mouth [[H6310]] for those with no voice, [[H483]] for [[H413]] the justice [[H1779]] of all [[H3605]] the dispossessed. [[H1121]] 
9 Open [[H6605]] your mouth, [[H6310]] judge [[H8199]] righteously, [[H6664]] and defend the cause [[H1777]] of the poor [[H6041]] and needy. [[H34]] 
10 Who [[H4310]] can find [[H4672]] a wife [[H802]] of noble character? [[H2428]] She is far [[H7350]] more precious [[H4377]] than rubies. [[H6443]] 
11 The heart [[H3820]] of her husband [[H1167]] trusts in her, [[H982]] and he will [[H3808]] lack nothing [[H2637]] of value. [[H7998]] 
12 She will bring him [[H1580]] good [[H2896]] and not [[H3808]] harm [[H7451]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of her life. [[H2416]] 
13 She selects [[H1875]] wool [[H6785]] and flax [[H6593]] and works [[H6213]] with eager [[H2656]] hands. [[H3709]] 
14 She is [[H1961]] like the merchant [[H5503]] ships, [[H591]] bringing [[H935]] her food [[H3899]] from afar. [[H4801]] 
15 She rises [[H6965]] while it is still [[H5750]] night [[H3915]] to provide [[H5414]] food [[H2964]] for her household [[H1004]] and portions [[H2706]] for her maidservants. [[H5291]] 
16 She appraises [[H2161]] a field [[H7704]] and buys it; [[H3947]] from her earnings [[H6529]] she plants [[H5193]] a vineyard. [[H3754]] 
17 She girds herself [[H2296]] with strength [[H5797]] and shows that her arms [[H2220]] are strong. [[H553]] 
18 She sees [[H2938]] that [[H3588]] her gain [[H5504]] [is] good, [[H2896]] and her lamp [[H5216]] is not [[H3808]] extinguished [[H3518]] at night. [[H3915]] 
19 She stretches [[H7971]] out her hands [[H3027]] to the distaff [[H3601]] and grasps [[H8551]] the spindle [[H6418]] with her fingers. [[H3709]] 
20 She opens [[H6566]] her arms [[H3709]] to the poor [[H6041]] and reaches out [[H7971]] her hands [[H3027]] to the needy. [[H34]] 
21 When it snows, [[H7950]] she is not [[H3808]] afraid [[H3372]] for her household; [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] [they are] all [[H3605]] clothed [[H3847]] in scarlet. [[H8144]] 
22 She makes [[H6213]] coverings for her bed; [[H4765]] her clothing [[H3830]] is fine linen [[H8336]] and purple. [[H713]] 
23 Her husband [[H1167]] is known [[H3045]] at the city gate, [[H8179]] where he sits [[H3427]] among [[H5973]] the elders [[H2205]] of the land. [[H776]] 
24 She makes [[H6213]] linen garments [[H5466]] and sells [them]; [[H4376]] she delivers [[H5414]] sashes [[H2289]] to the merchants. [[H3669]] 
25 Strength [[H5797]] and honor [[H1926]] are her clothing, [[H3830]] and she can laugh [[H7832]] at the days [[H3117]] to come. [[H314]] 
26 She opens [[H6605]] her mouth [[H6310]] with wisdom, [[H2451]] and faithful [[H2617]] instruction [[H8451]] is on [[H5921]] her tongue. [[H3956]] 
27 She watches over [[H6822]] the affairs [[H1979]] of her household [[H1004]] and does not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the bread [[H3899]] of idleness. [[H6104]] 
28 Her children [[H1121]] rise up [[H6965]] and call her blessed; [[H833]] her husband [[H1167]] praises her as well: [[H1984]] 
29 “Many [[H7227]] daughters [[H1323]] have done [[H6213]] noble things, [[H2428]] but you [[H859]] surpass [[H5927]] them [[H5921]] all!” [[H3605]] 
30 Charm [[H2580]] is deceptive [[H8267]] and beauty [[H3308]] is fleeting, [[H1892]] but a woman [[H802]] who fears [[H3373]] the LORD [[H3069]] is to be praised. [[H1984]] 
31 Give [[H5414]] her  the fruit [[H6529]] of her hands, [[H3027]] and let her works [[H4639]] praise her [[H1984]] at the gates. [[H8179]]
