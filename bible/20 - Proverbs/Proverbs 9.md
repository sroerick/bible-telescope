# Proverbs 9
[[Proverbs 8|←]] • [[Proverbs 10|→]]
1 Wisdom [[H2454]] has built [[H1129]] her house; [[H1004]] she has carved out [[H2672]] her seven [[H7651]] pillars. [[H5982]] 
2 She has prepared [[H2873]] her meat; [[H2874]] she has mixed [[H4537]] her wine; [[H3196]] she has also [[H637]] set [[H6186]] her table. [[H7979]] 
3 She has sent out [[H7971]] her maidservants; [[H5291]] she calls out [[H7121]] from [[H5921]] the heights [[H4791]] of the city: [[H7176]] 
4 “Whoever [[H4310]] [is] simple, [[H6612]] let him turn in [[H5493]] here!” [[H2008]] To him who lacks [[H2638]] judgment [[H3820]] she says: [[H559]] 
5 “Come, [[H1980]] eat [[H3898]] my bread, [[H3899]] and drink [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] I have mixed. [[H4537]] 
6 Leave your folly [[H6612]] behind, [[H5800]] and you will live; [[H2421]] walk [[H833]] in the way [[H1870]] of understanding.” [[H998]] 
7 He who corrects [[H3256]] a mocker [[H3887]] will bring [[H3947]] shame on himself; [[H7036]] he who rebukes [[H3198]] a wicked man [[H7563]] will be tainted. [[H3971]] 
8 Do not [[H408]] rebuke [[H3198]] a mocker [[H3887]] or [[H6435]] he will hate you; [[H8130]] rebuke [[H3198]] a wise man, [[H2450]] and he will love you. [[H157]] 
9 Instruct [[H5414]] a wise man, [[H2450]] and he will be wiser [[H2449]] still; [[H5750]] teach [[H3045]] a righteous man, [[H6662]] and he will increase [[H3254]] [his] learning. [[H3948]] 
10 The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3069]] is the beginning [[H8462]] of wisdom, [[H2451]] and knowledge [[H1847]] of the Holy One [[H6918]] is understanding. [[H998]] 
11 For [[H3588]] through [wisdom]  your days [[H3117]] will be multiplied, [[H7235]] and years [[H8141]] will be added [[H3254]] to your life. [[H2416]] 
12 If [[H518]] you are wise, [[H2449]] you are wise [[H2449]] to your own advantage;  but if you scoff, [[H3887]] you alone [[H905]] will bear [the consequences]. [[H5375]] 
13 The woman [[H802]] named Folly [[H3687]] is loud; [[H1993]] [she is] naive [[H6615]] and knows [[H3045]] nothing. [[H1077]] 
14 She sits [[H3427]] at the door [[H6607]] of her house, [[H1004]] on [[H5921]] a seat [[H3678]] in the heights [[H4791]] of the city, [[H7176]] 
15 calling [[H7121]] to those who pass by, [[H5674]] who make [[H3474]] their paths {straight}: [[H734]] 
16 “Whoever [[H4310]] [is] simple, [[H6612]] let him turn in [[H5493]] here!” [[H2008]] To him who lacks [[H2638]] judgment [[H3820]] she says: [[H559]] 
17 “Stolen [[H1589]] water [[H4325]] is sweet, [[H4985]] and bread [[H3899]] [eaten] in secret [[H5643]] is tasty!” [[H5276]] 
18 But they do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the dead [[H7496]] are there, [[H8033]] that her guests [[H7121]] [are] in the depths [[H6012]] of Sheol. [[H7585]]
