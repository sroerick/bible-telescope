# Proverbs 24
[[Proverbs 23|←]] • [[Proverbs 25|→]]
1 Do not [[H408]] envy [[H7065]] wicked [[H7451]] men [[H376]] or desire [[H183]] their company; [[H1961]] 
2 for [[H3588]] their hearts [[H3820]] devise [[H1897]] violence, [[H7701]] and their lips [[H8193]] declare [[H1696]] trouble. [[H5999]] 
3 By wisdom [[H2451]] a house [[H1004]] is built [[H1129]] and by understanding [[H8394]] it is established; [[H3559]] 
4 through knowledge [[H1847]] its rooms [[H2315]] are filled [[H4390]] with every [[H3605]] precious [[H3368]] and beautiful [[H5273]] treasure. [[H1952]] 
5 A wise [[H2450]] man [[H1397]] [is] strong, [[H5797]] and a man [[H376]] of knowledge [[H1847]] enhances [[H553]] his strength; [[H3581]] 
6 only [[H3588]] with sound guidance [[H8458]] should you wage [[H6213]] war, [[H4421]] and victory [[H8668]] lies in a multitude [[H7230]] of counselors. [[H3289]] 
7 Wisdom [[H2454]] [is] too high [[H7311]] for a fool; [[H191]] he does not [[H3808]] open [[H6605]] his mouth [[H6310]] in the meeting place. [[H8179]] 
8 He who plots [[H2803]] evil [[H7489]] will be called [[H7121]] a schemer. [[H1167]] 
9 A foolish [[H200]] scheme [[H2154]] is sin, [[H2403]] and a mocker [[H3887]] is detestable [[H8441]] to men. [[H120]] 
10 If you falter [[H7503]] in the day [[H3117]] of distress, [[H6869]] how small [[H6862]] [is] your strength! [[H3581]] 
11 Rescue [[H5337]] those being led away [[H3947]] to death, [[H4194]] and restrain [[H2820]] those stumbling [[H4131]] toward the slaughter. [[H2027]] 
12 If [[H3588]] you say, [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] we did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] about this,” [[H2088]] will not [[H3808]] He [[H1931]] who weighs [[H8505]] hearts [[H3826]] consider it? [[H995]] Does not the One [[H1931]] who guards [[H5341]] your life [[H5315]] know? [[H3045]] Will He not repay [[H7725]] a man [[H120]] according to his deeds? [[H6467]] 
13 Eat [[H398]] honey, [[H1706]] my son, [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] it is good, [[H2896]] and the honeycomb [[H5317]] is sweet [[H4966]] to your [[H5921]] taste. [[H2441]] 
14 Know [[H3045]] that wisdom [[H2451]] [is sweet] [[H3651]] for your soul. [[H5315]] If [[H518]] you find it, [[H4672]] there is [[H3426]] a future [for you], [[H319]] and your hope [[H8615]] will never [[H3808]] be cut off. [[H3772]] 
15 Do not [[H408]] lie in wait, [[H693]] O wicked [man], [[H7563]] near the dwelling [[H5116]] of the righteous; [[H6662]] do not [[H408]] destroy [[H7703]] his resting place. [[H7258]] 
16 For though [[H3588]] a righteous [[H6662]] man falls [[H5307]] seven times, [[H7651]] he will get up, [[H6965]] but the wicked [[H7563]] will stumble [[H3782]] into ruin. [[H7451]] 
17 Do not [[H408]] gloat [[H8055]] when your enemy [[H341]] falls, [[H5307]] and do not [[H408]] let your heart [[H3820]] rejoice [[H1523]] when he stumbles, [[H3782]] 
18 or [[H6435]] the LORD [[H3069]] will see [[H7200]] and disapprove, [[H7489]] and turn His wrath [[H639]] away [[H7725]] from him. [[H5921]] 
19 Do not [[H408]] fret [[H2734]] over evildoers, [[H7489]] and do not [[H408]] be envious [[H7065]] of the wicked. [[H7563]] 
20 For [[H3588]] the evil [man] [[H7451]] has [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] future; [[H319]] the lamp [[H5216]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will be extinguished. [[H1846]] 
21 My son, [[H1121]] fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] and the king, [[H4428]] and do not [[H408]] associate [[H6148]] with [[H5973]] the rebellious. [[H8138]] 
22 For [[H3588]] [those two] will bring [[H6965]] sudden [[H6597]] destruction; [[H343]] who [[H4310]] knows [[H3045]] what ruin [[H6365]] [they] can bring? [[H8147]] 
23 These [[H428]] also [[H1571]] are sayings of the wise: [[H2450]] To show partiality [[H5234]] in judgment [[H4941]] is not [[H1077]] good. [[H2896]] 
24 Whoever tells [[H559]] the guilty, [[H7563]] “You [[H859]] are innocent”— [[H6662]] peoples [[H5971]] will curse him, [[H5344]] and nations [[H3816]] will denounce him; [[H2194]] 
25 but it will go well [[H5276]] with those who convict the guilty, [[H3198]] and rich [[H2896]] blessing [[H1293]] will come [[H935]] upon them. [[H5921]] 
26 An honest [[H5228]] answer [[H1697]] given [[H7725]] is like a kiss [[H5401]] on the lips. [[H8193]] 
27 Complete [[H3559]] your outdoor [[H2351]] work, [[H4399]] and prepare [[H6257]] your field; [[H7704]] after that, [[H310]] you can build [[H1129]] your house. [[H1004]] 
28 Do not [[H408]] testify [[H1961]] against your neighbor [[H7453]] without cause, [[H2600]] and do not deceive [[H6601]] with your lips. [[H8193]] 
29 Do not [[H408]] say, [[H559]] “I will do [[H6213]] to him  as [[H834]] he has done [[H6213]] to me;  I will repay [[H7725]] the man [[H376]] according to his work.” [[H6467]] 
30 I went [[H5674]] past [[H5921]] the field [[H7704]] of a sluggard [[H376]] and by [[H5921]] the vineyard [[H3754]] of a man [[H120]] lacking [[H2638]] judgment. [[H3820]] 
31 Thorns [[H2738]] had grown up [[H5927]] everywhere, [[H3605]] thistles [[H7063]] had covered [[H3680]] the ground, [[H6440]] and the stone [[H68]] wall [[H1444]] was broken down. [[H2040]] 
32 I [[H595]] observed [[H2372]] and took [it] [[H7896]] to heart; [[H3820]] I looked [[H7200]] and received [[H3947]] instruction: [[H4148]] 
33 A little [[H4592]] sleep, [[H8142]] a little [[H4592]] slumber, [[H8572]] a little [[H4592]] folding [[H2264]] of the hands [[H3027]] to rest, [[H7901]] 
34 and poverty [[H7389]] will come [upon you] [[H935]] like a robber, [[H1980]] and need [[H4270]] like a bandit. [[H376]]
