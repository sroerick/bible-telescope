# Proverbs 4
[[Proverbs 3|←]] • [[Proverbs 5|→]]
1 Listen, [[H8085]] my sons, [[H1121]] to the instruction [[H4148]] of a father; [[H1]] pay attention [[H7181]] and gain [[H3045]] understanding. [[H998]] 
2 For [[H3588]] I give [[H5414]] you  sound [[H2896]] teaching; [[H3948]] do not [[H408]] abandon [[H5800]] my instruction. [[H8451]] 
3 When [[H3588]] I was [[H1961]] a son [[H1121]] to my father, [[H1]] tender [[H7390]] and the only child [[H3173]] of [[H6440]] my mother, [[H517]] 
4 he taught [[H3384]] me and said, [[H559]] “Let your heart [[H3820]] lay hold [[H8551]] of my words; [[H1697]] keep [[H8104]] my commandments [[H4687]] and you will live. [[H2421]] 
5 Get [[H7069]] wisdom, [[H2451]] get [[H7069]] understanding; [[H998]] do not [[H408]] forget [[H7911]] my words [[H561]] or turn from them. [[H5186]] 
6 Do not [[H408]] forsake [wisdom], [[H5800]] and she will preserve you; [[H8104]] love her, [[H157]] and she will guard you. [[H5341]] 
7 Wisdom [[H2451]] is supreme; [[H7225]] therefore acquire [[H7069]] wisdom. [[H2451]] And whatever [[H3605]] else you obtain, [[H7075]] gain [[H7069]] understanding. [[H998]] 
8 Prize her, [[H5549]] and she will exalt you; [[H7311]] if [[H3588]] you embrace her, [[H2263]] she will honor you. [[H3513]] 
9 She will set [[H5414]] a garland [[H3880]] of grace [[H2580]] on your head; [[H7218]] she will present you [[H4042]] with a crown [[H5850]] of beauty.” [[H8597]] 
10 Listen, [[H8085]] my son, [[H1121]] and receive [[H3947]] my words, [[H561]] and the years [[H8141]] of your life [[H2416]] will be many. [[H7235]] 
11 I will guide you [[H3384]] in the way [[H1870]] of wisdom; [[H2451]] I will lead you [[H1869]] on straight [[H3476]] paths. [[H4570]] 
12 When you walk, [[H1980]] your steps [[H6806]] will not [[H3808]] be impeded; [[H3334]] when [[H518]] you run, [[H7323]] you will not [[H3808]] stumble. [[H3782]] 
13 Hold on [[H2388]] to instruction; [[H4148]] do not [[H408]] let go. [[H7503]] Guard it, [[H5341]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is your life. [[H2416]] 
14 Do not [[H408]] set foot [[H935]] on the path [[H734]] of the wicked [[H7563]] [or] [[H408]] walk [[H833]] in the way [[H1870]] of evil men. [[H7451]] 
15 Avoid it; [[H6544]] do not [[H408]] travel on it. [[H5674]] Turn [[H7847]] from it [[H5921]] and pass on by. [[H5674]] 
16 For [[H3588]] they cannot [[H3808]] sleep [[H3462]] unless [[H518]] they do evil, [[H7489]] they are deprived [[H1497]] of slumber [[H8142]] until [[H518]] they make someone fall, [[H3782]] 
17 since [[H3588]] they eat [[H3898]] the bread [[H3899]] of wickedness [[H7562]] and drink [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] of violence. [[H2555]] 
18 The path [[H734]] of the righteous [[H6662]] is like the first gleam [[H216]] of dawn, [[H5051]] shining brighter [[H1980]] and brighter until [[H5704]] midday. [[H3559]] 
19 But the way [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is like the darkest gloom; [[H653]] they do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] makes them stumble. [[H3782]] 
20 My son, [[H1121]] pay attention [[H7181]] to my words; [[H1697]] incline [[H5186]] your ear [[H241]] to my sayings. [[H561]] 
21 Do not [[H408]] lose [[H3868]] sight of them; [[H5869]] keep [[H8104]] them within [[H8432]] your heart. [[H3824]] 
22 For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are life [[H2416]] to those who find them, [[H4672]] and health [[H4832]] to the whole [[H3605]] body. [[H1320]] 
23 Guard [[H5341]] your heart [[H3820]] with all [[H3605]] diligence, [[H4929]] for [[H3588]] from it [[H4480]] flow [[H8444]] springs of life. [[H2416]] 
24 Put [[H5493]] away [[H4480]] deception [[H6143]] from your mouth; [[H6310]] keep [[H7368]] your lips [[H8193]] from perverse speech. [[H3891]] 
25 Let your eyes [[H5869]] look [[H5027]] forward; [[H5227]] fix your gaze [[H6079]] straight [[H3474]] ahead. [[H5048]] 
26 Make level [[H6424]] paths [[H4570]] for your feet, [[H7272]] and all [[H3605]] your ways [[H1870]] will be sure. [[H3559]] 
27 Do not [[H408]] swerve [[H5186]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left; [[H8040]] turn [[H5493]] your feet {away} [[H7272]] from evil. [[H7451]]
