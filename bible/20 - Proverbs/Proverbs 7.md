# Proverbs 7
[[Proverbs 6|←]] • [[Proverbs 8|→]]
1 My son, [[H1121]] keep [[H8104]] my words [[H561]] and treasure [[H6845]] my commandments [[H4687]] within you. [[H854]] 
2 Keep [[H8104]] my commandments [[H4687]] and live; [[H2421]] guard my teachings [[H8451]] as the apple [[H380]] of your eye. [[H5869]] 
3 Tie [[H7194]] them to [[H5921]] your fingers; [[H676]] write [[H3789]] them on [[H5921]] the tablet [[H3871]] of your heart. [[H3820]] 
4 Say [[H559]] to wisdom, [[H2451]] “You [[H859]] are my sister,” [[H269]] and call [[H7121]] understanding [[H998]] your kinsman, [[H4129]] 
5 that they may keep you [[H8104]] from the adulteress, [[H2114]] from the stranger [[H5237]] with seductive [[H2505]] words. [[H561]] 
6 For [[H3588]] at the window [[H2474]] of my house [[H1004]] I looked [[H8259]] through [[H1157]] the lattice. [[H822]] 
7 I saw [[H7200]] among the simple, [[H6612]] I noticed [[H995]] among the youths, [[H1121]] a young man [[H5288]] lacking [[H2638]] judgment, [[H3820]] 
8 crossing [[H5674]] the street [[H7784]] near [[H681]] her corner, [[H6438]] strolling [[H6805]] down the road [[H1870]] to her house, [[H1004]] 
9 at twilight, [[H5399]] as the day was fading, [[H6153]] into the dark [[H653]] of the night. [[H380]] 
10 Then [[H2009]] a woman [[H802]] came out to meet him, [[H7125]] [with] attire [[H7897]] of a prostitute [[H2181]] and cunning [[H5341]] of heart. [[H3820]] 
11 She [[H1931]] is loud [[H1993]] and defiant; [[H5637]] her feet [[H7272]] do not [[H3808]] remain [[H7931]] at home. [[H1004]] 
12 Now [[H6471]] in the street, [[H2351]] now [[H6471]] in the squares, [[H7339]] she lurks [[H693]] at [[H681]] every [[H3605]] corner. [[H6438]] 
13 She seizes [[H2388]] him  and kisses him; [[H5401]] she brazenly [[H5810]] says [[H559]] to him:  
14 “I have made my peace [[H8002]] offerings; [[H2077]] today [[H3117]] I have paid [[H7999]] my vows. [[H5088]] 
15 So [[H5921]] I came out [[H3318]] to meet you; [[H7125]] I sought you, [[H7836]] and I have found you. [[H4672]] 
16 I have decked [[H7234]] my bed [[H6210]] with coverings, [[H4765]] with colored [[H2405]] linen [[H330]] from Egypt. [[H4714]] 
17 I have perfumed [[H5130]] my bed [[H4904]] with myrrh, [[H4753]] with aloes, [[H174]] and with cinnamon. [[H7076]] 
18 Come, [[H1980]] let us take our fill [[H7301]] of love [[H1730]] until [[H5704]] the morning. [[H1242]] Let us delight [[H5965]] in loving caresses! [[H159]] 
19 For [[H3588]] my husband [[H376]] is not [[H369]] at home; [[H1004]] he has gone [[H1980]] on a long [[H7350]] journey. [[H1870]] 
20 He took [[H3947]] with him [[H3027]] a bag [[H6872]] of money [[H3701]] and will not be returning [[H935]] until [[H3117]] the moon [is] full.” [[H3677]] 
21 With her great [[H7230]] persuasion [[H3948]] she entices him; [[H5186]] she lures him [[H5080]] with her flattering [[H2506]] lips. [[H8193]] 
22 He follows her [[H1980]] on impulse, [[H6597]] like an ox [[H7794]] going [[H935]] to [[H413]] the slaughter, [[H2874]] like a deer [[H191]] bounding [[H5914]] into [[H413]] a trap, [[H4148]] 
23 until [[H5704]] an arrow [[H2671]] pierces [[H6398]] his liver, [[H3516]] like a bird [[H6833]] darting [[H4116]] into [[H413]] a snare— [[H6341]] not [[H3808]] knowing [[H3045]] it [[H1931]] will cost him his life. [[H5315]] 
24 Now, [[H6258]] my sons, [[H1121]] listen to me, [[H8085]] and attend [[H7181]] to the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]] 
25 Do not [[H408]] let your heart [[H3820]] turn aside [[H7847]] to [[H413]] her ways; [[H1870]] do not [[H408]] stray [[H8582]] into her paths. [[H5410]] 
26 For [[H3588]] she has brought many [[H7227]] down [[H5307]] to death; [[H2491]] her slain [[H2026]] are many [[H6099]] in number. [[H3605]] 
27 Her house [[H1004]] is the road [[H1870]] to Sheol, [[H7585]] descending [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the chambers [[H2315]] of death. [[H4194]]
