# Proverbs 15
[[Proverbs 14|←]] • [[Proverbs 16|→]]
1 A gentle [[H7390]] answer [[H4617]] turns away [[H7725]] wrath, [[H2534]] but a harsh [[H6089]] word [[H1697]] stirs up [[H5927]] anger. [[H639]] 
2 The tongue [[H3956]] of the wise [[H2450]] commends [[H3190]] knowledge, [[H1847]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the fool [[H3684]] spouts [[H5042]] folly. [[H200]] 
3 The eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] are in every [[H3605]] place, [[H4725]] observing [[H6822]] the evil [[H7451]] and the good. [[H2896]] 
4 A soothing [[H4832]] tongue [[H3956]] is a tree [[H6086]] of life, [[H2416]] but a perverse [tongue] [[H5558]] crushes [[H7667]] the spirit. [[H7307]] 
5 A fool [[H191]] rejects [[H5006]] his father’s [[H1]] discipline, [[H4148]] but whoever heeds [[H8104]] correction [[H8433]] is prudent. [[H6191]] 
6 The house [[H1004]] of the righteous [[H6662]] has great [[H7227]] treasure, [[H2633]] but the income [[H8393]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is trouble. [[H5916]] 
7 The lips [[H8193]] of the wise [[H2450]] spread [[H2219]] knowledge, [[H1847]] but not [[H3808]] so [[H3651]] the hearts [[H3820]] of fools. [[H3684]] 
8 The sacrifice [[H2077]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] but the prayer [[H8605]] of the upright [[H3477]] is His delight. [[H7522]] 
9 The LORD [[H3068]] detests [[H8441]] the way [[H1870]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] but He loves [[H157]] those who pursue [[H7291]] righteousness. [[H6666]] 
10 Discipline [[H4148]] is harsh [[H7451]] for him who leaves [[H5800]] the path; [[H734]] he who hates [[H8130]] correction [[H8433]] will die. [[H4191]] 
11 Sheol [[H7585]] and Abaddon [[H11]] lie open before [[H5048]] the LORD— [[H3069]] how much more [[H637]] the hearts [[H3826]] of men! [[H120]] 
12 A mocker [[H3887]] does not [[H3808]] love [[H157]] to be reproved, [[H3198]] nor will he [[H3808]] consult [[H413]] the wise. [[H2450]] 
13 A joyful [[H8056]] heart [[H3820]] makes a cheerful [[H3190]] countenance, [[H6440]] but sorrow [[H6094]] of the heart [[H3820]] crushes [[H5218]] the spirit. [[H7307]] 
14 A discerning [[H995]] heart [[H3820]] seeks [[H1245]] knowledge, [[H1847]] but the mouth [[H6440]] of a fool [[H3684]] feeds on [[H7462]] folly. [[H200]] 
15 All [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the oppressed [[H6041]] are bad, [[H7451]] but a cheerful [[H2896]] heart [[H3820]] has a continual [[H8548]] feast. [[H4960]] 
16 Better [[H2896]] a little [[H4592]] with the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] than great [[H7227]] treasure [[H214]] with turmoil. [[H4103]] 
17 Better [[H2896]] a dish [[H737]] of vegetables [[H3419]] where [[H8033]] there is love [[H160]] than a fattened [[H75]] ox [[H7794]] with hatred. [[H8135]] 
18 A hot-tempered [[H2534]] man [[H376]] stirs up [[H1624]] strife, [[H4066]] but he who is slow [[H750]] to anger [[H639]] calms [[H8252]] dispute. [[H7379]] 
19 The way [[H1870]] of the sluggard [[H6102]] is like a hedge [[H4881]] of thorns, [[H2312]] but the path [[H734]] of the upright [[H3477]] is a highway. [[H5549]] 
20 A wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] brings joy [[H8055]] to his father, [[H1]] but a foolish [[H3684]] man [[H120]] despises [[H959]] his mother. [[H517]] 
21 Folly [[H200]] is joy [[H8057]] to one who lacks [[H2638]] judgment, [[H3820]] but a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] walks [[H1980]] a straight path. [[H3474]] 
22 Plans [[H4284]] fail [[H6565]] for lack [[H369]] of counsel, [[H5475]] but with many [[H7230]] advisers [[H3289]] they succeed. [[H6965]] 
23 A man [[H376]] takes joy [[H8057]] in a fitting reply, [[H4617]] and how [[H4100]] good is [[H2896]] a timely [[H6256]] word! [[H1697]] 
24 The path [[H734]] of life [[H2416]] [leads] upward [[H4605]] for the wise, [[H7919]] that [[H4616]] he may avoid [[H5493]] going down [[H4295]] to Sheol. [[H7585]] 
25 The LORD [[H3068]] tears down [[H5255]] the house [[H1004]] of the proud, [[H1343]] but He protects [[H5324]] the boundaries [[H1366]] of the widow. [[H490]] 
26 The LORD [[H3068]] detests [[H8441]] the thoughts [[H4284]] of the wicked, [[H7451]] but the words [[H561]] of the pure [[H2889]] are pleasant [to Him]. [[H5278]] 
27 He who is greedy [[H1214]] for unjust gain [[H1215]] brings trouble [[H5916]] on his household, [[H1004]] but he who hates [[H8130]] bribes [[H4979]] will live. [[H2421]] 
28 The heart [[H3820]] of the righteous [[H6662]] ponders [[H1897]] how to answer, [[H6030]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] blurts out [[H5042]] evil. [[H7451]] 
29 The LORD [[H3068]] is far [[H7350]] from the wicked, [[H7563]] but He hears [[H8085]] the prayer [[H8605]] of the righteous. [[H6662]] 
30 The light [[H3974]] of the eyes [[H5869]] cheers [[H8055]] the heart, [[H3820]] [and] good [[H2896]] news [[H8052]] nourishes [[H1878]] the bones. [[H6106]] 
31 He who listens to [[H8085]] life-giving [[H2416]] reproof [[H8433]] will dwell [[H3885]] among [[H7130]] the wise. [[H2450]] 
32 He who ignores [[H6544]] discipline [[H4148]] despises [[H3988]] himself, [[H5315]] but whoever heeds [[H8085]] correction [[H8433]] gains [[H7069]] understanding. [[H3820]] 
33 The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [is] the instruction [[H4148]] of wisdom, [[H2451]] and humility [[H6038]] comes before [[H6440]] honor. [[H3519]]
