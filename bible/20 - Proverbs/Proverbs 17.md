# Proverbs 17
[[Proverbs 16|←]] • [[Proverbs 18|→]]
1 Better [[H2896]] a dry [[H2720]] morsel [[H6595]] in quietness [[H7962]] than a house [[H1004]] full of [[H4392]] feasting [[H2077]] with strife. [[H7379]] 
2 A wise [[H7919]] servant [[H5650]] will rule over [[H4910]] a disgraceful [[H954]] son [[H1121]] and share [[H2505]] his inheritance [[H5159]] as one of [[H8432]] the brothers. [[H251]] 
3 A crucible [[H4715]] for silver [[H3701]] and a furnace [[H3564]] for gold, [[H2091]] but the LORD [[H3068]] is the tester [[H974]] of hearts. [[H3826]] 
4 A wicked man [[H7489]] listens [[H7181]] to [[H5921]] evil [[H205]] lips; [[H8193]] a liar [[H8267]] gives ear [[H238]] to [[H5921]] a destructive [[H1942]] tongue. [[H3956]] 
5 He who mocks [[H3932]] the poor [[H7326]] insults [[H2778]] their Maker; [[H6213]] whoever gloats [[H8056]] over calamity [[H343]] will not [[H3808]] go unpunished. [[H5352]] 
6 Grandchildren [[H1121]] are the crown [[H5850]] of the aged, [[H2205]] and the glory [[H8597]] of a son [[H1121]] is his father. [[H1]] 
7 Eloquent [[H3499]] words [[H8193]] are unfit [[H3808]] for a fool; [[H5036]] how much worse [[H637]] are lying [[H8267]] lips [[H8193]] to a ruler! [[H5081]] 
8 A bribe [[H7810]] is a charm [[H2580]] to [[H5869]] its giver; [[H1167]] wherever [[H413]] he turns, [[H6437]] he succeeds. [[H7919]] 
9 Whoever conceals [[H3680]] an offense [[H6588]] promotes [[H1245]] love, [[H160]] but he who brings it up [[H8138]] separates [[H6504]] friends. [[H441]] 
10 A rebuke [[H1606]] affects [[H5181]] a man of discernment [[H995]] more than a hundred [[H3967]] lashes [[H5221]] to a fool. [[H3684]] 
11 An evil [man] [[H7451]] seeks [[H1245]] only [[H389]] rebellion; [[H4805]] so a cruel [[H394]] messenger [[H4397]] will be sent against him. [[H7971]] 
12 [It is better] [[H376]] to meet [[H6298]] a bear [[H1677]] robbed of her cubs [[H7909]] than [[H408]] a fool [[H3684]] in his folly. [[H200]] 
13 If anyone returns [[H7725]] evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good, [[H2896]] evil [[H7451]] will never [[H3808]] leave [[H4185]] his house. [[H1004]] 
14 To start [[H7225]] a quarrel [[H4066]] is to release [[H6362]] a flood; [[H4325]] so abandon [[H5203]] the dispute [[H7379]] before [[H6440]] it breaks out. [[H1566]] 
15 Acquitting [[H6663]] the guilty [[H7563]] and condemning [[H7561]] the righteous— [[H6662]] both [[H8147]] are detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD. [[H1571]] 
16 Why [[H4100]] should the fool [[H3684]] have money [[H4242]] in his hand [[H3027]] with no [[H369]] intention [[H3820]] of buying [[H7069]] wisdom? [[H2451]] 
17 A friend [[H7453]] loves [[H157]] at all [[H3605]] times, [[H6256]] and a brother [[H251]] is born [[H3205]] for adversity. [[H6869]] 
18 A man [[H120]] lacking [[H2638]] judgment [[H3820]] strikes [[H8628]] hands in pledge [[H3709]] and puts up security [[H6148]] for [[H6440]] his neighbor. [[H7453]] 
19 He who loves [[H157]] transgression [[H6588]] loves [[H157]] strife; [[H4683]] he who builds his gate [[H6607]] high [[H1361]] invites [[H1245]] destruction. [[H7667]] 
20 The one with a perverse [[H6141]] heart [[H3820]] finds [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] good, [[H2896]] and he whose tongue [[H3956]] is deceitful [[H2015]] will fall [[H5307]] into trouble. [[H7451]] 
21 A man fathers [[H3205]] a fool [[H3684]] to his own grief; [[H8424]] the father [[H1]] of a fool [[H5036]] has no [[H3808]] joy. [[H8055]] 
22 A joyful [[H8056]] heart [[H3820]] is good [[H3190]] medicine, [[H1456]] but a broken [[H5218]] spirit [[H7307]] dries up [[H3001]] the bones. [[H1634]] 
23 A wicked [man] [[H7563]] takes [[H3947]] a covert [[H2436]] bribe [[H7810]] to subvert [[H5186]] the course [[H734]] of justice. [[H4941]] 
24 Wisdom [[H2451]] is the focus [[H6440]] of the discerning, [[H995]] but the eyes [[H5869]] of a fool [[H3684]] wander to the ends [[H7097]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
25 A foolish [[H3684]] son [[H1121]] brings grief [[H3708]] to his father [[H1]] and bitterness [[H4470]] to her who bore him. [[H3205]] 
26 It is surely [[H1571]] not [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] to punish [[H6064]] the innocent [[H6662]] or to beat [[H5221]] a noble [[H5081]] for [[H5921]] his honesty. [[H3476]] 
27 A man of knowledge [[H3045]] restrains [[H2820]] his words, [[H561]] and a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] keeps a cool head. [[H7119]] 
28 Even [[H1571]] a fool [[H191]] is considered [[H2803]] wise [[H2450]] if he keeps silent, [[H2790]] [and] discerning [[H995]] when he holds [[H331]] his tongue. [[H8193]]
