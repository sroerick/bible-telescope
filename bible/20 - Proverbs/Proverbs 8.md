# Proverbs 8
[[Proverbs 7|←]] • [[Proverbs 9|→]]
1 Does not [[H3808]] wisdom [[H2451]] call out, [[H7121]] and understanding [[H8394]] raise [[H5414]] her voice? [[H6963]] 
2 On the heights [[H7218]] overlooking [[H5921]] the road, [[H1870]] at the crossroads [[H1004]] she takes her stand. [[H5324]] 
3 Beside [[H3027]] the gates [[H8179]] to [[H6310]] the city, [[H7176]] at the entrances [[H3996]] she cries out: [[H7442]] 
4 “To you, [[H413]] O men, [[H376]] I call out, [[H7121]] and my cry [[H6963]] is to [[H413]] the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]] 
5 O you simple, [[H6612]] learn [[H995]] to be shrewd, [[H6195]] and you foolish, [[H3684]] gain understanding. [[H995]] 
6 Listen, [[H8085]] for [[H3588]] I speak [[H1696]] of noble things, [[H5057]] and the opening [[H4669]] of my lips [[H8193]] [will reveal] right. [[H4339]] 
7 For [[H3588]] my mouth [[H2441]] will speak [[H1897]] the truth, [[H571]] and wickedness [[H7562]] is detestable [[H8441]] to my lips. [[H8193]] 
8 All [[H3605]] the words [[H561]] of my mouth [[H6310]] are righteous; [[H6664]] none [[H369]] are crooked [[H6617]] or perverse. [[H6141]] 
9 They [are] [[H3605]] all plain [[H5228]] to the discerning, [[H995]] and upright [[H3477]] to those who find [[H4672]] knowledge. [[H1847]] 
10 Receive [[H3947]] my instruction [[H4148]] instead of [[H408]] silver, [[H3701]] and knowledge [[H1847]] rather than pure [[H977]] gold. [[H2742]] 
11 For [[H3588]] wisdom [[H2451]] is more precious [[H2896]] than rubies, [[H6443]] and nothing [[H3605]] you desire [[H2656]] compares [[H7737]] with her.  
12 I, [[H589]] wisdom, [[H2451]] dwell together [[H7931]] with prudence, [[H6195]] and I find [[H4672]] knowledge [[H1847]] and discretion. [[H4209]] 
13 To fear [[H3374]] the LORD [[H3068]] is to hate [[H8130]] evil; [[H7451]] I hate [[H8130]] arrogant [[H1347]] pride, [[H1344]] evil [[H7451]] conduct, [[H1870]] and perverse [[H8419]] speech. [[H6310]] 
14 Counsel [[H6098]] and sound judgment [[H8454]] are mine;  I [[H589]] have insight [[H998]] and strength. [[H1369]] 
15 By me  kings [[H4428]] reign, [[H4427]] and rulers [[H7336]] enact just [[H6664]] laws; [[H2710]] 
16 By me  princes [[H8269]] rule, [[H8323]] and all [[H3605]] nobles [[H5081]] who govern [[H8199]] justly. [[H776]] 
17 I [[H589]] love [[H157]] those who love me, [[H157]] and those who seek me early [[H7836]] shall find me. [[H4672]] 
18 With [[H854]] me are riches [[H6239]] and honor, [[H3519]] enduring [[H6276]] wealth [[H1952]] and righteousness. [[H6666]] 
19 My fruit [[H6529]] is better [[H2896]] than gold, [[H2742]] pure gold, [[H6337]] and my harvest [[H8393]] [surpasses] choice [[H977]] silver. [[H3701]] 
20 I walk [[H1980]] in the way [[H734]] of righteousness, [[H6666]] along [[H8432]] the paths [[H5410]] of justice, [[H4941]] 
21 bestowing [[H5157]] wealth [[H3426]] on those who love me, [[H157]] and making [[H4390]] their treasuries {full}. [[H214]] 
22 The LORD [[H3068]] possessed me [[H7069]] at the beginning [[H7225]] of His work, [[H1870]] before [[H6924]] His deeds [[H4659]] of old. [[H227]] 
23 From everlasting [[H5769]] I was established, [[H5258]] from the beginning, [[H7218]] before the earth [[H776]] began. [[H6924]] 
24 When there were no [[H369]] watery depths, [[H8415]] I was brought forth, [[H2342]] when no [[H369]] springs [[H4599]] were overflowing [[H3513]] with water. [[H4325]] 
25 Before [[H2962]] the mountains [[H2022]] were settled, [[H2883]] before [[H6440]] the hills, [[H1389]] I was brought forth, [[H2342]] 
26 before [[H5704]] He made [[H6213]] the land [[H776]] or fields, [[H2351]] or any [[H7218]] of the dust [[H6083]] of the earth. [[H8398]] 
27 I [[H589]] was there [[H8033]] when He established [[H3559]] the heavens, [[H8064]] when He inscribed [[H2710]] the horizon [[H2329]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the deep, [[H8415]] 
28 when He established [[H553]] the clouds [[H7834]] above, [[H4605]] when the fountains [[H5869]] of the deep [[H8415]] gushed forth, [[H5810]] 
29 when He set [[H7760]] a boundary [[H2706]] for the sea, [[H3220]] so that the waters [[H4325]] would not [[H3808]] surpass [[H5674]] His command, [[H6310]] when He marked out [[H2710]] the foundations [[H4144]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
30 Then I was [[H1961]] a skilled craftsman [[H525]] at His side, [[H681]] and [[H1961]] His delight [[H8191]] day [[H3117]] [by] day, [[H3117]] rejoicing [[H7832]] always [[H3605]] in His presence. [[H6440]] 
31 I was rejoicing [[H7832]] in His whole world, [[H8398]] delighting [[H8191]] together [[H854]] in the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]] 
32 Now therefore, [[H6258]] my sons, [[H1121]] listen [[H8085]] to me,  for blessed [[H835]] are those who keep [[H8104]] my ways. [[H1870]] 
33 Listen [[H8085]] to instruction [[H4148]] and be wise; [[H2449]] do not [[H408]] ignore it. [[H6544]] 
34 Blessed [[H835]] is the man [[H120]] who listens [[H8085]] to me,  watching [[H8245]] daily [[H3117]] at [[H5921]] my doors, [[H1817]] waiting [[H8104]] at the posts [[H4201]] of my doorway. [[H6607]] 
35 For [[H3588]] whoever finds [[H4672]] me finds [[H4672]] life [[H2416]] and obtains [[H6329]] the favor [[H7522]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] 
36 but he who fails to find me [[H2398]] harms [[H2554]] himself; [[H5315]] all [[H3605]] who hate me [[H8130]] love [[H157]] death.” [[H4194]]
