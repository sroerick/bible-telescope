# Proverbs 28
[[Proverbs 27|←]] • [[Proverbs 29|→]]
1 The wicked [[H7563]] flee [[H5127]] when no one [[H369]] pursues, [[H7291]] but the righteous [[H6662]] are as bold [[H982]] as a lion. [[H3715]] 
2 A land [[H776]] in rebellion [[H6588]] has many [[H7227]] rulers, [[H8269]] but a man [[H120]] of understanding [[H995]] [and] knowledge [[H3045]] maintains order. [[H748]] 
3 A destitute [[H7326]] leader [[H1397]] who oppresses [[H6231]] the poor [[H1800]] is like a driving [[H5502]] rain [[H4306]] that leaves no [[H369]] food. [[H3899]] 
4 Those who forsake [[H5800]] the law [[H8451]] praise [[H1984]] the wicked, [[H7563]] but those who keep [[H8104]] the law [[H8451]] resist [[H1624]] them.  
5 Evil [[H7451]] men [[H582]] do not [[H3808]] understand [[H995]] justice, [[H4941]] but those who seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3069]] comprehend [[H995]] fully. [[H3605]] 
6 Better [[H2896]] a poor man [[H7326]] who walks [[H1980]] with integrity [[H8537]] than a rich man [[H6223]] whose ways [[H1870]] are perverse. [[H6141]] 
7 A discerning [[H995]] son [[H1121]] keeps [[H5341]] the law, [[H8451]] but a companion [[H7462]] of gluttons [[H2151]] disgraces [[H3637]] his father. [[H1]] 
8 He who increases [[H7235]] his wealth [[H1952]] by interest [[H5392]] and usury [[H8636]] lays it up for another, [[H6908]] who will be kind [[H2603]] to the poor. [[H1800]] 
9 Whoever turns [[H5493]] his ear {away} [[H241]] from hearing [[H8085]] the law, [[H8451]] even [[H1571]] his prayer [[H8605]] is detestable. [[H8441]] 
10 He who leads [[H7686]] the upright [[H3477]] along the path [[H1870]] of evil [[H7451]] will fall [[H5307]] into his own [[H1931]] pit, [[H7816]] but the blameless [[H8549]] will inherit [[H5157]] what is good. [[H2896]] 
11 A rich [[H6223]] man [[H376]] is wise [[H2450]] in his own eyes, [[H5869]] but a poor man [[H1800]] with discernment [[H995]] sees through him. [[H2713]] 
12 When the righteous [[H6662]] triumph, [[H5970]] there is great [[H7227]] glory, [[H8597]] but when the wicked [[H7563]] rise, [[H6965]] men [[H120]] hide themselves. [[H2664]] 
13 He who conceals [[H3680]] his sins [[H6588]] will not [[H3808]] prosper, [[H6743]] but whoever confesses [[H3034]] and renounces them [[H5800]] will find mercy. [[H7355]] 
14 Blessed [[H835]] [is] the man [[H120]] who is always [[H8548]] reverent, [[H6342]] but he who hardens [[H7185]] his heart [[H3820]] falls [[H5307]] into trouble. [[H7451]] 
15 Like a roaring [[H5098]] lion [[H738]] or a charging [[H8264]] bear [[H1677]] is a wicked [[H7563]] ruler [[H4910]] over [[H5921]] a helpless [[H1800]] people. [[H5971]] 
16 A leader [[H5057]] who lacks [[H2638]] understanding [[H8394]] [is] also a great [[H7227]] oppressor, [[H4642]] but he who hates [[H8130]] dishonest profit [[H1215]] will prolong [[H748]] [his] days. [[H3117]] 
17 A man [[H120]] burdened [[H6231]] by bloodguilt [[H1818]] will be a fugitive [[H5127]] until [[H5704]] death; [[H953]] let no one [[H408]] support [[H8551]] him.  
18 He who walks [[H1980]] with integrity [[H8549]] will be delivered, [[H3467]] but whoever is perverse [[H6140]] [in his] ways [[H1870]] will suddenly [[H259]] fall. [[H5307]] 
19 The one who works [[H5647]] his land [[H127]] will have plenty of [[H7646]] food, [[H3899]] but whoever chases [[H7291]] fantasies [[H7386]] will have his fill [[H7646]] of poverty. [[H7389]] 
20 A faithful [[H530]] man [[H376]] will abound [[H7227]] with blessings, [[H1293]] but one eager [[H213]] to be rich [[H6238]] will not [[H3808]] go unpunished. [[H5352]] 
21 To show partiality [[H5234]] [is] not [[H3808]] good, [[H2896]] because a man [[H1397]] may sin [[H6586]] for [[H5921]] a piece [[H6595]] of bread. [[H3899]] 
22 A stingy [[H7451]] man [[H376]] hastens [[H926]] after wealth [[H1952]] and does not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] poverty [[H2639]] awaits him. [[H935]] 
23 He who rebukes [[H3198]] a man [[H120]] will later [[H310]] find [[H4672]] more favor [[H2580]] than one who flatters [[H2505]] with his tongue. [[H3956]] 
24 He who robs [[H1497]] his father [[H1]] or mother, [[H517]] saying, [[H559]] “It is not [[H369]] wrong,” [[H6588]] is a companion [[H2270]] to a man [[H376]] who destroys. [[H7843]] 
25 A greedy man [[H7342]] stirs up [[H1624]] strife, [[H4066]] but he who trusts [[H982]] in [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] will prosper. [[H1878]] 
26 He who trusts [[H982]] in himself [[H3820]] is a fool, [[H3684]] but one who walks [[H1980]] in wisdom [[H2451]] will be safe. [[H4422]] 
27 Whoever gives [[H5414]] to the poor [[H7326]] will not [[H369]] be in need, [[H4270]] but he who hides [[H5956]] his eyes [[H5869]] will receive many [[H7227]] curses. [[H3994]] 
28 When the wicked [[H7563]] come to power, [[H6965]] people [[H120]] hide themselves; [[H5641]] but when they perish, [[H6]] the righteous [[H6662]] flourish. [[H7235]]
