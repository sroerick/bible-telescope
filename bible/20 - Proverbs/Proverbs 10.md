# Proverbs 10
[[Proverbs 9|←]] • [[Proverbs 11|→]]
1 The proverbs [[H4912]] of Solomon: [[H8010]] A wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] brings joy [[H8055]] to his father, [[H1]] but a foolish [[H3684]] son [[H1121]] grief [[H8424]] to his mother. [[H517]] 
2 Ill-gotten [[H7562]] treasures [[H214]] profit [[H3276]] nothing, [[H3808]] but righteousness [[H6666]] brings deliverance [[H5337]] from death. [[H4194]] 
3 The LORD [[H3068]] does not [[H3808]] let the righteous [[H6662]] go hungry, [[H7456]] but He denies [[H1920]] the craving [[H1942]] of the wicked. [[H7563]] 
4 Idle [[H7423]] hands [[H3709]] make [[H6213]] one poor, [[H7326]] but diligent [[H2742]] hands [[H3027]] bring wealth. [[H6238]] 
5 He who gathers [[H103]] in summer [[H7019]] [is] a wise [[H7919]] son, [[H1121]] [but] he who sleeps [[H7290]] during harvest [[H7105]] is a disgraceful [[H954]] son. [[H1121]] 
6 Blessings [[H1293]] are on the head [[H7218]] of the righteous, [[H6662]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] conceals [[H3680]] violence. [[H2555]] 
7 The memory [[H2143]] of the righteous [[H6662]] is a blessing, [[H1293]] but the name [[H8034]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will rot. [[H7537]] 
8 A wise [[H2450]] heart [[H3820]] will receive [[H3947]] commandments, [[H4687]] but foolish [[H191]] lips [[H8193]] will come to ruin. [[H3832]] 
9 He who walks [[H1980]] in integrity [[H8537]] walks [[H1980]] securely, [[H983]] but he who perverts [[H6140]] his ways [[H1870]] will be found out. [[H3045]] 
10 He who winks [[H7169]] the eye [[H5869]] causes [[H5414]] grief, [[H6094]] and foolish [[H191]] lips [[H8193]] will come to ruin. [[H3832]] 
11 The mouth [[H6310]] of the righteous [[H6662]] is a fountain [[H4726]] of life, [[H2416]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] conceals [[H3680]] violence. [[H2555]] 
12 Hatred [[H8135]] stirs up [[H5782]] dissension, [[H4090]] but love [[H160]] covers [[H3680]] all [[H3605]] transgressions. [[H6588]] 
13 Wisdom [[H2451]] is found [[H4672]] on the lips [[H8193]] of the discerning, [[H995]] but a rod [[H7626]] is for the back [[H1460]] of him who lacks [[H2638]] judgment. [[H3820]] 
14 The wise [[H2450]] store up [[H6845]] knowledge, [[H1847]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the fool [[H191]] invites [[H7138]] destruction. [[H4288]] 
15 The wealth [[H1952]] of the rich man [[H6223]] is his fortified [[H5797]] city, [[H7151]] but poverty [[H7389]] is the ruin [[H4288]] of the poor. [[H1800]] 
16 The labor [[H6468]] of the righteous [[H6662]] leads to life, [[H2416]] [but] the gain [[H8393]] of the wicked [[H7563]] [brings] punishment. [[H2403]] 
17 Whoever heeds [[H8104]] instruction [[H4148]] is on the path [[H734]] to life, [[H2416]] but he who ignores [[H5800]] reproof [[H8433]] goes astray. [[H8582]] 
18 The one who conceals [[H3680]] hatred [[H8135]] has lying [[H8267]] lips, [[H8193]] and whoever spreads [[H3318]] slander [[H1681]] is a fool. [[H3684]] 
19 When words [[H1697]] are many, [[H7230]] sin [[H6588]] is unavoidable, [[H3808]] but he who restrains [[H2820]] his lips [[H8193]] is wise. [[H7919]] 
20 The tongue [[H3956]] of the righteous [[H6662]] [is] choice [[H977]] silver, [[H3701]] [but] the heart [[H3820]] of the wicked [[H7563]] [has] little worth. [[H4592]] 
21 The lips [[H8193]] of the righteous [[H6662]] feed [[H7462]] many, [[H7227]] but fools [[H191]] die [[H4191]] for lack [[H2638]] of judgment. [[H3820]] 
22 The blessing [[H1293]] of the LORD [[H3068]] enriches, [[H6238]] and He adds [[H3254]] no [[H3808]] sorrow [[H6089]] to it. [[H5973]] 
23 The fool [[H3684]] delights [[H7814]] in shameful [[H2154]] conduct, [[H6213]] but a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] has wisdom. [[H2451]] 
24 What the wicked [[H7563]] dreads [[H4034]] will overtake him, [[H935]] but the desire [[H8378]] of the righteous [[H6662]] will be granted. [[H5414]] 
25 When the whirlwind [[H5492]] passes, [[H5674]] the wicked [[H7563]] are no more, [[H369]] but the righteous [[H6662]] are secure [[H3247]] forever. [[H5769]] 
26 Like vinegar [[H2558]] to the teeth [[H8127]] and smoke [[H6227]] to the eyes, [[H5869]] so [[H3651]] [is] the sluggard [[H6102]] to those who send him. [[H7971]] 
27 The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] prolongs [[H3254]] life, [[H3117]] but the years [[H8141]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will be shortened. [[H7114]] 
28 The hope [[H8431]] of the righteous [[H6662]] is joy, [[H8057]] but the expectations [[H8615]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will perish. [[H6]] 
29 The way [[H1870]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is a refuge [[H4581]] to the upright, [[H8537]] but destruction [[H4288]] [awaits] those who do [[H6466]] evil. [[H205]] 
30 The righteous [[H6662]] will never [[H5769]] be shaken, [[H4131]] but the wicked [[H7563]] will not [[H3808]] inhabit [[H7931]] the land. [[H776]] 
31 The mouth [[H6310]] of the righteous [[H6662]] brings forth [[H5107]] wisdom, [[H2451]] but a perverse [[H8419]] tongue [[H3956]] will be cut out. [[H3772]] 
32 The lips [[H8193]] of the righteous [[H6662]] know [[H3045]] what is fitting, [[H7522]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is perverse. [[H8419]]
