# Proverbs 16
[[Proverbs 15|←]] • [[Proverbs 17|→]]
1 The plans [[H4633]] of the heart [[H3820]] belong to man, [[H120]] but the reply [[H4617]] of the tongue [[H3956]] [is] from the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 All [[H3605]] a man’s [[H376]] ways [[H1870]] [are] pure [[H2134]] in his own eyes, [[H5869]] but his motives [[H7307]] are weighed [[H8505]] by the LORD. [[H3069]] 
3 Commit [[H1556]] your works [[H4639]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and your plans [[H4284]] will be achieved. [[H3559]] 
4 The LORD [[H3068]] has made [[H6466]] everything [[H3605]] for His purpose— [[H4617]] even [[H1571]] the wicked [[H7563]] for the day [[H3117]] of disaster. [[H7451]] 
5 Everyone [[H3605]] [who is] proud [[H1362]] in heart [[H3820]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] be assured that [[H3027]] he will not [[H3808]] go unpunished. [[H5352]] 
6 By loving devotion [[H2617]] and truth, [[H571]] wickedness [[H5771]] is atoned for, [[H3722]] and by the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [a man] turns aside [[H5493]] from evil. [[H7451]] 
7 When a man’s [[H376]] ways [[H1870]] please [[H7521]] the LORD, [[H3068]] He makes even [[H1571]] [the man’s] enemies [[H341]] live at peace [[H7999]] with him. [[H854]] 
8 Better [[H2896]] a little [[H4592]] with righteousness [[H6666]] than great [[H7230]] gain [[H8393]] with injustice. [[H3808]] 
9 A man’s [[H120]] heart [[H3820]] plans [[H2803]] his course, [[H1870]] but the LORD [[H3068]] determines [[H3559]] his steps. [[H6806]] 
10 A divine verdict [[H7081]] is on [[H5921]] the lips [[H8193]] of a king; [[H4428]] his mouth [[H6310]] should not [[H3808]] betray [[H4603]] justice. [[H4941]] 
11 Honest [[H4941]] scales [[H6425]] and balances [[H3976]] [are from] the LORD; [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the weights [[H68]] in the bag [[H3599]] are His concern. [[H4639]] 
12 Wicked [[H7562]] behavior [[H6213]] is detestable [[H8441]] to kings, [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] a throne [[H3678]] is established [[H3559]] through righteousness. [[H6666]] 
13 Righteous [[H6664]] lips [[H8193]] are a king’s [[H4428]] delight, [[H7522]] and he who speaks [[H1696]] honestly [[H3477]] is beloved. [[H157]] 
14 The wrath [[H2534]] of a king [[H4428]] is a messenger [[H4397]] of death, [[H4194]] but a wise [[H2450]] man [[H376]] will pacify it. [[H3722]] 
15 When a king’s [[H4428]] face [[H6440]] brightens, [[H216]] there is life; [[H2416]] his favor [[H7522]] is like a rain cloud [[H5645]] in spring. [[H4456]] 
16 How much [[H4100]] better [[H2896]] to acquire [[H7069]] wisdom [[H2451]] than gold; [[H2742]] to gain [[H7069]] understanding [[H998]] is more desirable [[H977]] than silver. [[H3701]] 
17 The highway [[H4546]] of the upright [[H3477]] leads away [[H5493]] from evil; [[H7451]] he who guards [[H5341]] his way [[H1870]] protects [[H8104]] his life. [[H5315]] 
18 Pride [[H1347]] goes before [[H6440]] destruction, [[H7667]] and a haughty [[H1363]] spirit [[H7307]] before [[H6440]] a fall. [[H3783]] 
19 It is better [[H2896]] to be lowly [[H8217]] in spirit [[H7307]] among [[H854]] the humble [[H6041]] than to divide [[H2505]] the spoil [[H7998]] with [[H854]] the proud. [[H1343]] 
20 Whoever heeds [[H7919]] instruction [[H1697]] will find [[H4672]] success, [[H2896]] and blessed [[H835]] is he who trusts [[H982]] in the LORD. [[H3068]] 
21 The wise [[H2450]] in heart [[H3820]] will be called [[H7121]] discerning, [[H995]] and pleasant [[H4986]] speech [[H8193]] increases [[H3254]] learning. [[H3948]] 
22 Understanding [[H7922]] is a fountain [[H4726]] of life [[H2416]] to its possessor, [[H1167]] but the discipline [[H4148]] of fools [[H191]] is folly. [[H200]] 
23 The heart [[H3820]] of the wise [man] [[H2450]] instructs [[H7919]] his mouth [[H6310]] and adds [[H3254]] persuasiveness [[H3948]] to [[H5921]] his lips. [[H8193]] 
24 Pleasant [[H5278]] words [[H561]] are a honeycomb, [[H6688]] sweet [[H4966]] to the soul [[H5315]] and healing [[H4832]] to the bones. [[H6106]] 
25 There is [[H3426]] a way [[H1870]] that seems right [[H3477]] to [[H6440]] a man, [[H376]] but its end [[H319]] is the way [[H1870]] of death. [[H4194]] 
26 A worker’s [[H6001]] appetite [[H5315]] works [[H5998]] for him  because [[H3588]] his hunger [[H6310]] drives [[H404]] him onward. [[H5921]] 
27 A worthless [[H1100]] man [[H376]] digs up [[H3738]] evil, [[H7451]] and his speech [[H8193]] is like a scorching [[H6867]] fire. [[H784]] 
28 A perverse [[H8419]] man [[H376]] spreads [[H7971]] dissension, [[H4066]] and a gossip [[H5372]] divides [[H6504]] close friends. [[H441]] 
29 A violent [[H2555]] man [[H376]] entices [[H6601]] his neighbor [[H7453]] and leads him [[H1980]] down a path [[H1870]] [that is] not [[H3808]] good. [[H2896]] 
30 He who winks [[H6095]] his eye [[H5869]] devises [[H2803]] perversity; [[H8419]] he who purses [[H7169]] his lips [[H8193]] is bent on [[H3615]] evil. [[H7451]] 
31 Gray hair [[H7872]] [is] a crown [[H5850]] of glory; [[H8597]] it is attained [[H4672]] along the path [[H1870]] of righteousness. [[H6666]] 
32 [He who is] slow [[H750]] to anger [[H639]] [is] better [[H2896]] than a warrior, [[H1368]] and he who controls [[H4910]] his temper [is greater] [[H7307]] than one who captures [[H3920]] a city. [[H5892]] 
33 The lot [[H1486]] is cast [[H2904]] into the lap, [[H2436]] but its every [[H3605]] decision [[H4941]] is from the LORD. [[H3068]]
