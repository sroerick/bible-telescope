# Proverbs 11
[[Proverbs 10|←]] • [[Proverbs 12|→]]
1 Dishonest [[H4820]] scales [[H3976]] are an abomination [[H8441]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] but an accurate [[H8003]] weight [[H68]] is His delight. [[H7522]] 
2 When pride [[H2087]] comes, [[H935]] disgrace [[H7036]] follows, [[H935]] but with [[H854]] humility [[H6800]] comes wisdom. [[H2451]] 
3 The integrity [[H8538]] of the upright [[H3477]] guides them, [[H5148]] but the perversity [[H5558]] of the faithless [[H898]] destroys them. [[H7703]] 
4 Riches [[H1952]] are worthless [[H3276]] in the day [[H3117]] of wrath, [[H5678]] but righteousness [[H6666]] brings deliverance [[H5337]] from death. [[H4194]] 
5 The righteousness [[H6666]] of the blameless [[H8549]] directs [[H3474]] their path, [[H1870]] but the wicked [[H7563]] fall [[H5307]] by their own wickedness. [[H7564]] 
6 The righteousness [[H6666]] of the upright [[H3477]] delivers them, [[H5337]] but the faithless [[H898]] are trapped [[H3920]] by their own desires. [[H1942]] 
7 When the wicked [[H7563]] man [[H120]] dies, [[H4194]] his hope [[H8615]] perishes, [[H6]] and the hope [[H8431]] of his strength [[H205]] vanishes. [[H6]] 
8 The righteous man [[H6662]] is delivered [[H2502]] from trouble; [[H6869]] in his place [[H8478]] the wicked man [[H7563]] goes in. [[H935]] 
9 With his mouth [[H6310]] the ungodly man [[H2611]] destroys [[H7843]] his neighbor, [[H7453]] but through knowledge [[H1847]] the righteous [[H6662]] are rescued. [[H2502]] 
10 When the righteous [[H6662]] thrive, [[H2898]] the city [[H7151]] rejoices, [[H5970]] and when the wicked [[H7563]] perish, [[H6]] there are shouts of joy. [[H7440]] 
11 By the blessing [[H1293]] of the upright [[H3477]] a city [[H7176]] is built up, [[H7311]] but by the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] it is torn down. [[H2040]] 
12 Whoever shows contempt [[H936]] for his neighbor [[H7453]] lacks [[H2638]] judgment, [[H3820]] but a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] holds his peace. [[H2790]] 
13 A gossip [[H7400]] reveals [[H1540]] a secret, [[H5475]] but a trustworthy [[H539]] person [[H7307]] keeps [[H3680]] a confidence. [[H1697]] 
14 For lack [[H369]] of guidance, [[H8458]] a nation [[H5971]] falls, [[H5307]] but with many [[H7230]] counselors [[H3289]] [comes] deliverance. [[H8668]] 
15 He who puts up security [[H6148]] for a stranger [[H2114]] will surely suffer, [[H7451]] but the one who hates [[H8130]] indebtedness [[H8628]] is secure. [[H982]] 
16 A gracious [[H2580]] woman [[H802]] attains [[H8551]] honor, [[H3519]] but violent [[H6184]] men gain [[H8551]] only wealth. [[H6239]] 
17 A kind [[H2617]] man [[H376]] benefits [[H1580]] himself, [[H5315]] but a cruel man [[H394]] brings trouble [[H5916]] on himself. [[H7607]] 
18 The wicked man [[H7563]] earns [[H6213]] an empty [[H8267]] wage, [[H6468]] but he who sows [[H2232]] righteousness [[H6666]] [reaps] a true [[H571]] reward. [[H7938]] 
19 Genuine [[H3651]] righteousness [[H6666]] leads to life, [[H2416]] but the pursuit [[H7291]] of evil [[H7451]] brings death. [[H4194]] 
20 The perverse [[H6141]] in heart [[H3820]] are an abomination [[H8441]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] but the blameless [[H8549]] in [their] walk [[H1870]] are His delight. [[H7522]] 
21 Be assured [[H3027]] that the wicked [[H7451]] will not [[H3808]] go unpunished, [[H5352]] but the offspring [[H2233]] of the righteous [[H6662]] will escape. [[H4422]] 
22 Like a gold [[H2091]] ring [[H5141]] in a pig’s [[H2386]] snout [[H639]] [is] a beautiful [[H3303]] woman [[H802]] who lacks [[H5493]] discretion. [[H2940]] 
23 The desire [[H8378]] of the righteous [[H6662]] leads only [[H389]] to good, [[H2896]] but the hope [[H8615]] of the wicked [[H7563]] [brings] wrath. [[H5678]] 
24 One gives freely, [[H6340]] yet gains [[H3254]] even more; [[H5750]] another withholds [[H2820]] what is right, [[H3476]] only [[H389]] to become poor. [[H4270]] 
25 A generous [[H1293]] soul [[H5315]] will prosper, [[H1878]] and he who refreshes others [[H7301]] will himself [[H1931]] be refreshed. [[H3384]] 
26 The people [[H3816]] will curse [[H5344]] the hoarder [[H4513]] of grain, [[H1250]] but blessing [[H1293]] will crown [[H7218]] the one who sells it. [[H7666]] 
27 He who searches out [[H7836]] good [[H2896]] finds [[H1245]] favor, [[H7522]] but evil [[H7451]] will come [[H935]] to him who seeks it. [[H1875]] 
28 He who trusts [[H982]] in his riches [[H6239]] will fall, [[H5307]] but the righteous [[H6662]] will thrive [[H6524]] like foliage. [[H5929]] 
29 He who brings trouble [[H5916]] on his house [[H1004]] will inherit [[H5157]] the wind, [[H7307]] and the fool [[H191]] will be servant [[H5650]] to the wise [[H2450]] of heart. [[H3820]] 
30 The fruit [[H6529]] of the righteous [[H6662]] is a tree [[H6086]] of life, [[H2416]] and he who wins [[H3947]] souls [[H5315]] [is] wise. [[H2450]] 
31 If [[H2005]] the righteous [[H6662]] receive their due [[H7999]] on earth, [[H776]] how much more [[H637]] the ungodly [[H7563]] and the sinner! [[H2398]]
