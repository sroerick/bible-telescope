# Proverbs 30
[[Proverbs 29|←]] • [[Proverbs 31|→]]
1 The words [[H1697]] of Agur [[H94]] son [[H1121]] of Jakeh, [[H3348]] the oracle [[H4853]] that this man [[H1397]] declares [[H5002]] to Ithiel— [[H384]] to Ithiel [[H384]] and Ucal: [[H401]] 
2 “Surely [[H3588]] I [am] [[H595]] the most ignorant [[H1198]] of men, [[H376]] and I lack [[H3808]] the understanding [[H998]] of a man. [[H120]] 
3 I have not [[H3808]] learned [[H3925]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and I have no knowledge [[H1847]] of the Holy One. [[H6918]] 
4 Who [[H4310]] has ascended [[H5927]] to heaven [[H8064]] and come down? [[H3381]] Who [[H4310]] has gathered [[H622]] the wind [[H7307]] in His hands? [[H2651]] Who [[H4310]] has bound up [[H6887]] the waters [[H4325]] in His cloak? [[H8071]] Who [[H4310]] has established [[H6965]] all [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth? [[H776]] What [[H4100]] is His name, [[H8034]] and what [[H4100]] is the name [[H8034]] of His Son [[H1121]] surely [[H3588]] you know! [[H3045]] 
5 Every [[H3605]] word [[H565]] of God [[H433]] is pure; [[H6884]] He [[H1931]] is a shield [[H4043]] to those who take refuge [[H2620]] in Him.  
6 Do not [[H408]] add [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] His words, [[H1697]] lest [[H6435]] He rebuke [[H3198]] you  and prove you a liar. [[H3576]] 
7 Two [[H8147]] things I ask [[H7592]] of You— [[H4480]] do not [[H408]] refuse me [[H4513]] before [[H2962]] I die: [[H4191]] 
8 Keep falsehood [[H7723]] and deceitful [[H3577]] words [[H1697]] far [[H7368]] from me. [[H4480]] Give me [[H5414]] neither [[H408]] poverty [[H7389]] nor riches; [[H6239]] feed me [[H2963]] with the bread [[H3899]] that is my portion. [[H2706]] 
9 Otherwise, [[H6435]] I may have too much [[H7646]] and deny You, [[H3584]] saying, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] is the LORD?” [[H6435]] Or I may become poor [[H3423]] and steal, [[H1589]] profaning [[H8610]] the name [[H8034]] of my God. [[H430]] 
10 Do not [[H408]] slander [[H3960]] a servant [[H5650]] to [[H413]] his master, [[H113]] or [[H6435]] he will curse you, [[H7043]] and you will bear the guilt. [[H816]] 
11 There is a generation [[H1755]] of those who curse [[H7043]] their fathers [[H1]] and do not [[H3808]] bless [[H1288]] their mothers. [[H517]] 
12 There is a generation [[H1755]] of those who are pure [[H2889]] in their own eyes [[H5869]] and yet unwashed [[H7364]] of their filth. [[H6675]] 
13 There is a generation— [[H1755]] how [[H4100]] haughty [[H7311]] are their eyes, [[H5869]] and pretentious [[H5375]] are their glances— [[H6079]] 
14 there is a generation [[H1755]] whose teeth [[H8127]] are swords [[H2719]] and whose jaws [[H4973]] are knives, [[H3979]] devouring [[H398]] the oppressed [[H6041]] from the earth, [[H776]] and the needy [[H34]] from [among] men. [[H120]] 
15 The leech [[H5936]] has two [[H8147]] daughters: [[H1323]] Give [[H3051]] [and] Give. [[H3051]] There [[H2007]] are three [[H7969]] [things that] are never [[H3808]] satisfied, [[H7646]] four [that] [[H702]] never [[H3808]] say, [[H559]] “Enough!”: [[H1952]] 
16 Sheol, [[H7585]] the barren [[H6115]] womb, [[H7356]] land [[H776]] that is never [[H3808]] satisfied [[H7646]] with water, [[H4325]] and fire [[H784]] that never [[H3808]] says, [[H559]] “Enough!” [[H1952]] 
17 As for the eye [[H5869]] [that] mocks [[H3932]] a father [[H1]] and scorns [[H936]] obedience [[H3349]] to a mother, [[H517]] may the ravens [[H6158]] of the valley [[H5158]] pluck it out [[H5365]] and young [[H1121]] vultures [[H5404]] devour it. [[H398]] 
18 There [[H1992]] are three [things] [[H7969]] too wonderful [[H6381]] for me, [[H4480]] four [[H702]] that  I cannot [[H3808]] understand: [[H3045]] 
19 the way [[H1870]] of an eagle [[H5404]] in the sky, [[H8064]] the way [[H1870]] of a snake [[H5175]] on [[H5921]] a rock, [[H6697]] the way [[H1870]] of a ship [[H591]] at sea, [[H3220]] and the way [[H1870]] of a man [[H1397]] with a maiden. [[H5959]] 
20 This [[H3651]] is the way [[H1870]] of an adulteress: [[H802]] She eats [[H398]] and wipes [[H4229]] her mouth [[H6310]] and says, [[H559]] “I have done [[H6466]] no [[H3808]] wrong.” [[H205]] 
21 Under [[H8478]] three things [[H7969]] the earth [[H776]] trembles, [[H7264]] under [[H8478]] four [[H702]] it cannot [[H3808]] bear up: [[H5375]] 
22 a servant [[H5650]] who [[H3588]] becomes king, [[H4427]] a fool [[H5036]] who [[H3588]] is filled [[H7646]] with food, [[H3899]] 
23 an unloved woman [[H8130]] who [[H3588]] marries, [[H1166]] and a maidservant [[H8198]] who [[H3588]] supplants [[H3423]] her mistress. [[H1404]] 
24 Four [[H702]] things on earth [[H776]] are small, [[H6996]] yet they [[H1992]] are exceedingly [[H2449]] wise: [[H2450]] 
25 the ants [[H5244]] are not [[H3808]] a strong [[H5794]] species, [[H5971]] yet they store up [[H3559]] their food [[H3899]] in the summer; [[H7019]] 
26 the conies [[H8227]] are not [[H3808]] a mighty [[H6099]] species, [[H5971]] yet they make [[H7760]] their homes [[H1004]] in the rocks; [[H5553]] 
27 the locusts [[H697]] have no [[H369]] king, [[H4428]] yet they all [[H3605]] advance [[H3318]] in formation; [[H2686]] 
28 and the lizard [[H8079]] can be caught [[H8610]] in one’s hands, [[H3027]] yet it [[H1931]] [is found] in the palaces [[H1964]] of kings. [[H4428]] 
29 There [[H1992]] are three things [[H7969]] that are stately [[H3190]] in their stride, [[H6806]] and four that [[H702]] are impressive [[H3190]] in their walk: [[H1980]] 
30 a lion, [[H3918]] mighty [[H1368]] among the beasts, [[H929]] and refusing [[H3808]] to retreat [[H7725]] before [[H6440]] anything; [[H3605]] 
31 a strutting rooster, [[H2223]] a he-goat, [[H8495]] and a king [[H4428]] with his army [[H510]] around him. [[H5973]] 
32 If [[H518]] you have foolishly [[H5034]] exalted yourself [[H5375]] or if [[H518]] you have plotted evil, [[H2161]] put your hand [[H3027]] over your mouth. [[H6310]] 
33 For [[H3588]] as the churning [[H4330]] of milk [[H2461]] yields [[H3318]] butter, [[H2529]] and the twisting [[H4330]] of the nose [[H639]] draws [[H3318]] blood, [[H1818]] so the stirring [[H4330]] of anger [[H639]] brings forth [[H3318]] strife. [[H7379]]
