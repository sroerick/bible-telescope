# Proverbs 19
[[Proverbs 18|←]] • [[Proverbs 20|→]]
1 Better [[H2896]] a poor man [[H7326]] who walks [[H1980]] with integrity [[H8537]] than a fool [[H3684]] whose lips [[H8193]] are perverse. [[H6141]] 
2 Even [[H1571]] zeal [[H5315]] is no [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] without [[H3808]] knowledge, [[H1847]] and he who hurries [[H213]] his footsteps [[H7272]] misses the mark. [[H2398]] 
3 A man’s [[H120]] own folly [[H200]] subverts [[H5557]] his way, [[H1870]] yet his heart [[H3820]] rages [[H2196]] against [[H5921]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 Wealth [[H1952]] attracts [[H3254]] many [[H7227]] friends, [[H7453]] but a poor man [[H1800]] is deserted [[H6504]] by his friend. [[H7453]] 
5 A false [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] will not [[H3808]] go unpunished, [[H5352]] and one who utters [[H6315]] lies [[H3577]] will not [[H3808]] escape. [[H4422]] 
6 Many [[H7227]] seek [[H2470]] the favor [[H6440]] of the prince, [[H5081]] and everyone [[H3605]] is a friend [[H7453]] of [[H376]] the gift giver. [[H4976]] 
7 All [[H3605]] the brothers [[H251]] of a poor man [[H7326]] hate him— [[H8130]] how much more [[H637]] do his friends [[H4828]] avoid [[H7368]] him! [[H4480]] He may pursue [[H7291]] them with pleading, [[H561]] but they [[H1992]] are nowhere to be found. [[H3808]] 
8 He who acquires [[H7069]] wisdom [[H3820]] loves [[H157]] himself; [[H5315]] one who safeguards [[H8104]] understanding [[H8394]] will find [[H4672]] success. [[H2896]] 
9 A false [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] will not [[H3808]] go unpunished, [[H5352]] and one who pours out [[H6315]] lies [[H3577]] will perish. [[H6]] 
10 Luxury [[H8588]] is unseemly [[H5000]] for a fool— [[H3684]] how much worse [[H637]] for a slave [[H5650]] to rule [[H4910]] over princes! [[H8269]] 
11 A man’s [[H120]] insight [[H7922]] gives him patience, [[H748]] and his virtue [[H8597]] is to overlook [[H5674]] an offense. [[H6588]] 
12 A king’s [[H4428]] rage [[H2197]] is like the roar [[H5099]] of a lion, [[H3715]] but his favor [[H7522]] is like dew [[H2919]] on [[H5921]] the grass. [[H6212]] 
13 A foolish [[H3684]] son [[H1121]] is his father’s [[H1]] ruin, [[H1942]] and a quarrelsome [[H4079]] wife [[H802]] is like a constant [[H2956]] dripping. [[H1812]] 
14 Houses [[H1004]] and wealth [[H1952]] are inherited [[H5159]] from fathers, [[H1]] but a prudent [[H7919]] wife [[H802]] [is] from the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 Laziness [[H6103]] brings on [[H5307]] deep sleep, [[H8639]] and an idle [[H7423]] soul [[H5315]] will suffer hunger. [[H7456]] 
16 He who keeps [[H8104]] a commandment [[H4687]] preserves [[H8104]] his soul; [[H5315]] [but] he who is careless [[H959]] in his ways [[H1870]] will die. [[H4191]] 
17 Kindness [[H2603]] to the poor [[H1800]] is a loan [[H3867]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and He will repay [[H7999]] [the lender].  
18 Discipline [[H3256]] your son, [[H1121]] for in that [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] hope; [[H8615]] do not [[H408]] be party [[H5375]] to [[H413]] his death. [[H4191]] 
19 A man of great anger [[H1632]] must pay [[H5375]] the penalty; [[H6066]] if [[H518]] you rescue [him], [[H5337]] you will have to do so again. [[H3254]] 
20 Listen [[H8085]] to counsel [[H6098]] and accept [[H6901]] discipline, [[H4148]] that [[H4616]] you may be wise [[H2449]] the rest of your days. [[H319]] 
21 Many [[H7227]] plans [[H4284]] are in a man’s [[H376]] heart, [[H3820]] but the purpose [[H6098]] of the LORD [[H1931]] will prevail. [[H6965]] 
22 The desire [[H8378]] of a man [[H120]] is loving devotion; [[H2617]] better [[H2896]] to be poor [[H7326]] than [[H376]] a liar. [[H3577]] 
23 The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] leads to life, [[H2416]] that one may rest [[H3885]] content, [[H7649]] without [[H1077]] visitation [[H6485]] from harm. [[H7451]] 
24 The sluggard [[H6102]] buries [[H2934]] his hand [[H3027]] in the dish; [[H6747]] he will not [[H3808]] even [[H1571]] bring it back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his mouth. [[H6310]] 
25 Strike [[H5221]] a mocker, [[H3887]] and the simple [[H6612]] will beware; [[H6191]] rebuke [[H3198]] the discerning [man], [[H995]] and he will gain [[H995]] knowledge. [[H1847]] 
26 He who assaults [[H7703]] his father [[H1]] and evicts [[H1272]] his mother [[H517]] is a son [[H1121]] who brings shame [[H954]] and disgrace. [[H2659]] 
27 If you cease [[H2308]] to hear [[H8085]] instruction, [[H4148]] my son, [[H1121]] you will stray [[H7686]] from the words [[H561]] of knowledge. [[H1847]] 
28 A corrupt [[H1100]] witness [[H5707]] mocks [[H3887]] justice, [[H4941]] and a wicked [[H7563]] mouth [[H6310]] swallows [[H1104]] iniquity. [[H205]] 
29 Judgments [[H8201]] are prepared [[H3559]] for mockers, [[H3887]] and beatings [[H4112]] for the backs [[H1460]] of fools. [[H3684]]
