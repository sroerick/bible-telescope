# Hosea 2
[[Hosea 1|←]] • [[Hosea 3|→]]
1 “Say of [[H559]] your brothers, [[H251]] ‘My people,’ [[H5971]] and of your sisters, [[H269]] ‘My loved one.’ [[H7355]] 
2 Rebuke [[H7378]] your mother, [[H517]] rebuke her. [[H7378]] For [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] is not [[H3808]] My wife, [[H802]] and I [[H595]] am not [[H3808]] her husband. [[H376]] Let her remove [[H5493]] the adultery [[H2183]] from her face [[H6440]] and the unfaithfulness [[H5005]] from between [[H996]] her breasts. [[H7699]] 
3 Otherwise, [[H6435]] I will strip [[H6584]] her naked [[H6174]] and expose her [[H3322]] like the day [[H3117]] of her birth. [[H3205]] I will make her [[H7760]] like a desert [[H4057]] and turn her into [[H7896]] a parched [[H6723]] land, [[H776]] and I will let her die [[H4191]] of thirst. [[H6772]] 
4 I will have no [[H3808]] compassion [[H7355]] on her children [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are the children [[H1121]] of adultery. [[H2183]] 
5 For [[H3588]] their mother [[H517]] has played the harlot [[H2181]] and has conceived them [[H2029]] in disgrace. [[H3001]] For [[H3588]] she thought, [[H559]] ‘I will go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] my lovers, [[H157]] who give me [[H5414]] bread [[H3899]] and water, [[H4325]] wool [[H6785]] and linen, [[H6593]] oil [[H8081]] and drink.’ [[H8250]] 
6 Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I will hedge up [[H7753]] her path [[H1870]] with thorns; [[H5518]] I will enclose her with a wall, [[H1443]] so she cannot [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] her way. [[H5410]] 
7 She will pursue [[H7291]] her lovers [[H157]] but not [[H3808]] catch [[H5381]] them; [[H853]] she will seek them [[H1245]] but not [[H3808]] find them. [[H4672]] Then she will say, [[H559]] ‘I will return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] my first [[H7223]] husband, [[H376]] for [[H3588]] then [[H227]] I was better off [[H2896]] than now.’ [[H6258]] 
8 For she [[H1931]] does not [[H3808]] acknowledge [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it was I [[H595]] who gave [[H5414]] her  grain, [[H1715]] new wine [[H8492]] and oil, [[H3323]] who lavished [[H7235]] her  with silver [[H3701]] and gold— [[H2091]] which was crafted [[H6213]] for Baal. [[H1168]] 
9 Therefore [[H3651]] I will take back [[H7725]] My grain [[H1715]] in its time [[H6256]] and My new wine [[H8492]] in its season; [[H4150]] I will take away [[H5337]] My wool [[H6785]] and linen, [[H6593]] which were [given] to cover [[H3680]] her nakedness. [[H6172]] 
10 And then [[H6258]] I will expose [[H1540]] her lewdness [[H5040]] in the sight [[H5869]] of her lovers, [[H157]] and no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] will deliver her [[H5337]] out of My hands. [[H3027]] 
11 I will put an end [[H7673]] to all [[H3605]] her exultation: [[H4885]] her feasts, [[H2282]] New Moons, [[H2320]] and Sabbaths— [[H7676]] all [[H3605]] her appointed feasts. [[H4150]] 
12 I will destroy [[H8074]] her vines [[H1612]] and fig trees, [[H8384]] which [[H834]] she thinks [[H559]] are the wages [[H866]] paid [[H5414]] by her lovers. [[H157]] So I will make [[H7760]] them into a thicket, [[H3293]] and the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] will devour them. [[H398]] 
13 I will punish [[H6485]] her [[H5921]] for the days [[H3117]] of the Baals [[H1168]] when [[H834]] she burned incense to them, [[H6999]] when she decked herself [[H5710]] with rings [[H5141]] and jewelry, [[H2484]] and went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] her lovers. [[H157]] But Me [[H853]] she forgot,” [[H7911]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
14 “Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will allure her [[H6601]] and lead [[H1980]] her to the wilderness, [[H4057]] and speak [[H1696]] to her [[H5921]] tenderly. [[H3820]] 
15 There [[H8033]] I will give back [[H5414]] her vineyards [[H3754]] and make the Valley [[H6010]] of Achor [[H5911]] into a gateway [[H6607]] of hope. [[H8615]] There [[H8033]] she will respond as she did [[H6030]] in the days [[H3117]] of her youth, [[H5271]] as in the day [[H3117]] she came up [[H5927]] out [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
16 In that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “you will call Me [[H7121]] ‘my husband,’ [[H376]] and no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] call Me [[H7121]] ‘my Master.’ [[H1180]] 
17 For I will remove [[H5493]] from her lips [[H6310]] the names [[H8034]] of the Baals; [[H1168]] no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] will their names [[H8034]] be invoked. [[H2142]] 
18 On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] for them  with [[H5973]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] [and] [[H5973]] the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] and the creatures that crawl [[H7431]] on the ground. [[H127]] And I will abolish [[H7665]] bow [[H7198]] and sword [[H2719]] and weapons of war [[H4421]] in [[H4480]] the land, [[H776]] and will make them lie down [[H7901]] in safety. [[H983]] 
19 So I will betroth you [[H781]] to Me  forever; [[H5769]] I will betroth you [[H781]] in righteousness [[H6664]] and justice, [[H4941]] in loving devotion [[H2617]] and compassion. [[H7356]] 
20 And I will betroth you [[H781]] in faithfulness, [[H530]] and you will know [[H3045]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
21 “On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will respond—” [[H6030]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD— [[H3068]] “I will respond [[H6030]] to the heavens, [[H8064]] and they [[H1992]] will respond [[H6030]] to the earth. [[H776]] 
22 And the earth [[H776]] will respond [[H6030]] to the grain, [[H1715]] to the new wine [[H8492]] and oil, [[H3323]] and they [[H1992]] will respond [[H6030]] to Jezreel. [[H3157]] 
23 And I will sow her [[H2232]] for Myself  in the land, [[H776]] and I will have compassion on [[H7355]] ‘No [[H3808]] Compassion.’ [[H7355]] I will say to those [called] [[H559]] ‘Not [[H3808]] My People,’ [[H5971]] ‘You [[H859]] are My people,’ [[H5971]] and they [[H1931]] will say, [[H559]] ‘You are my God.’” [[H430]]
