# Hosea 5
[[Hosea 4|←]] • [[Hosea 6|→]]
1 Hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] O priests! [[H3548]] Take heed, [[H7181]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel! [[H3478]] Give ear, [[H238]] O royal [[H4428]] house! [[H1004]] For [[H3588]] the judgment [[H4941]] is against you  because [[H3588]] you have been [[H1961]] a snare [[H6341]] at Mizpah [[H4709]] and a net [[H7568]] spread out [[H6566]] on [[H5921]] Tabor. [[H8396]] 
2 The rebels [[H7846]] are deep [[H6009]] in slaughter; [[H7819]] but I [[H589]] will chastise [[H4148]] all of them. [[H3605]] 
3 I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and Israel [[H3478]] is not [[H3808]] hidden [[H3582]] from Me. [[H4480]] For [[H3588]] now, [[H6258]] O Ephraim, [[H669]] you have turned to prostitution; [[H2181]] Israel [[H3478]] is defiled. [[H2930]] 
4 Their deeds [[H4611]] do not [[H3808]] permit them [[H5414]] to return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] their God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] a spirit [[H7307]] of prostitution [[H2183]] is within them, [[H7130]] and they do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 Israel’s [[H3478]] arrogance [[H1347]] testifies [[H6030]] against them; [[H6440]] both Israel [[H3478]] and Ephraim [[H669]] stumble [[H3782]] in their iniquity; [[H5771]] even [[H1571]] Judah [[H3063]] stumbles [[H3782]] with them. [[H5973]] 
6 They go [[H1980]] with their flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] to seek [[H1245]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but they do not [[H3808]] find Him; [[H4672]] He has withdrawn Himself [[H2502]] from them. [[H1992]] 
7 They have been unfaithful [[H898]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] they have borne [[H3205]] illegitimate [[H2114]] children. [[H1121]] Now [[H6258]] the New Moon [[H2320]] will devour them [[H398]] along with their land. [[H2506]] 
8 Blow [[H8628]] the horn [[H7782]] in Gibeah, [[H1390]] the trumpet [[H2689]] in Ramah; [[H7414]] raise the battle cry [[H7321]] in Beth-aven: [[H1007]] Lead on, [[H310]] O Benjamin! [[H1144]] 
9 Ephraim [[H669]] will be [[H1961]] laid waste [[H8047]] on the day [[H3117]] of rebuke; [[H8433]] among the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] I declare [[H3045]] what is certain. [[H539]] 
10 The princes [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] are like those [[H1961]] who move [[H5253]] boundary stones; [[H1366]] I will pour out [[H8210]] My fury [[H5678]] upon them [[H5921]] like water. [[H4325]] 
11 Ephraim [[H669]] is oppressed, [[H6217]] crushed [[H7533]] in judgment, [[H4941]] for [[H3588]] he is determined [[H2974]] to follow [[H1980]] what is worthless. [[H6673]] 
12 So I am [[H589]] like a moth [[H6211]] to Ephraim, [[H669]] and like decay [[H7538]] to the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
13 When Ephraim [[H669]] saw [[H7200]] his sickness [[H2483]] and Judah [[H3063]] his wound, [[H4205]] then Ephraim [[H669]] turned [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Assyria [[H804]] and sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] the great [[H3377]] king. [[H4428]] But he [[H1931]] cannot [[H3808]] cure [[H7495]] you  [or] [[H3808]] heal [[H1455]] your wound. [[H4205]] 
14 For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am like a lion [[H7826]] to Ephraim [[H669]] and like a young lion [[H3715]] to the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]] I, [[H589]] [even] I, [[H589]] will tear them to pieces [[H2963]] and go away. [[H1980]] I will carry them off [[H5375]] [where] no one [[H369]] can rescue them. [[H5337]] 
15 Then I will return [[H1980]] to [[H413]] My place [[H4725]] until [[H5704]] they admit their guilt [[H816]] and seek [[H1245]] My face; [[H6440]] in their affliction [[H6862]] they will earnestly seek Me.” [[H7836]]
