# Hosea 7
[[Hosea 6|←]] • [[Hosea 8|→]]
1 When I would heal [[H7495]] Israel, [[H3478]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of Ephraim [[H669]] is exposed, [[H1540]] with the crimes [[H7451]] of Samaria. [[H8111]] For [[H3588]] they practice [[H6466]] deceit [[H8267]] and thieves [[H1590]] break in; [[H935]] bandits [[H1416]] rob [[H6584]] [in the streets]. [[H2351]] 
2 But they fail to [[H1077]] consider [[H559]] in their hearts [[H3824]] that I remember [[H2142]] all [[H3605]] their evil. [[H7451]] Now [[H6258]] their deeds [[H4611]] are all around them; [[H5437]] they are [[H1961]] before [[H5048]] My face. [[H6440]] 
3 They delight [[H8055]] the king [[H4428]] with their evil, [[H7451]] the princes [[H8269]] with their lies. [[H3585]] 
4 They are all [[H3605]] adulterers, [[H5003]] like [[H3644]] an oven [[H8574]] heated [[H1197]] by a baker [[H644]] who needs not [[H7673]] stoke the fire [[H5782]] from the kneading [[H3888]] to [[H5704]] the rising [[H2556]] of the dough. [[H1217]] 
5 The princes [[H8269]] are inflamed [[H2470]] with wine [[H3196]] on the day [[H3117]] of our king; [[H4428]] so he joins hands [[H4900]] with [[H854]] those who mock him. [[H3945]] 
6 For [[H3588]] they prepare [[H7126]] their heart [[H3820]] like an oven, [[H8574]] while they lie in wait; [[H693]] all [[H3605]] night [[H3915]] their anger [[H644]] smolders; [[H3462]] in the morning [[H1242]] it [[H1931]] blazes [[H1197]] like a flaming [[H3852]] fire. [[H784]] 
7 All [[H3605]] of them are as hot [[H2552]] as an oven, [[H8574]] and they consume [[H398]] their rulers. [[H8199]] All [[H3605]] their kings [[H4428]] fall; [[H5307]] not one [[H369]] of them  calls [[H7121]] upon Me. [[H413]] 
8 Ephraim [[H669]] mixes [[H1101]] with the nations; [[H5971]] Ephraim [[H669]] is [[H1961]] an unturned [[H2015]] cake. [[H5692]] 
9 Foreigners [[H2114]] consume [[H398]] his strength, [[H3581]] but he [[H1931]] does not [[H3808]] notice. [[H3045]] Even [[H1571]] his hair is streaked [[H2236]] with gray, [[H7872]] but he [[H1931]] does not [[H3808]] realize. [[H3045]] 
10 Israel’s [[H3478]] arrogance [[H1347]] testifies [[H6030]] against them, [[H6440]] yet they do not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God; [[H430]] despite all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] they do not [[H3808]] seek Him. [[H1245]] 
11 So Ephraim [[H669]] has become [[H1961]] like a silly, [[H6601]] senseless [[H369]] dove— [[H3123]] calling out [[H7121]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] then turning [[H1980]] to Assyria. [[H804]] 
12 As [[H834]] they go, [[H1980]] I will spread [[H6566]] My net [[H7568]] over them; [[H5921]] I will bring them down [[H3381]] like birds [[H5775]] of the air. [[H8064]] I will chastise them [[H3256]] when I hear them [[H8088]] flocking together. [[H5712]] 
13 Woe [[H188]] to them, [[H1992]] for [[H3588]] they have strayed [[H5074]] from Me! [[H4480]] Destruction [[H7701]] to them, [[H1992]] for [[H3588]] they have rebelled [[H6586]] against Me!  Though I [[H595]] would redeem them, [[H6299]] they speak [[H1696]] lies [[H3577]] against Me. [[H5921]] 
14 They do not [[H3808]] cry out [[H2199]] to Me [[H413]] from their hearts [[H3820]] when [[H3588]] they wail [[H3213]] upon [[H5921]] their beds. [[H4904]] They slash themselves [[H1481]] for [[H5921]] grain [[H1715]] and new wine, [[H8492]] but turn away [[H5493]] from Me.  
15 Although I [[H589]] trained [[H3256]] and strengthened [[H2388]] their arms, [[H2220]] they plot [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] against Me. [[H413]] 
16 They turn, [[H7725]] but not [[H3808]] to the Most High; [[H5920]] they are [[H1961]] like a faulty [[H7423]] bow. [[H7198]] Their leaders [[H8269]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] for the cursing [[H2195]] of their tongue; [[H3956]] for this [[H2097]] they will be ridiculed [[H3933]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt.
