# Hosea 9
[[Hosea 8|←]] • [[Hosea 10|→]]
1 Do not [[H408]] rejoice, [[H8055]] O Israel, [[H3478]] with [[H413]] exultation [[H1524]] like the nations, [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] you have played the harlot [[H2181]] against [[H5921]] your God; [[H430]] you have made love [[H157]] [for] hire [[H868]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] threshing floor. [[H1715]] 
2 The threshing floor [[H1637]] and winepress [[H3342]] will not [[H3808]] feed them, [[H7462]] and the new wine [[H8492]] will fail them. [[H3584]] 
3 They will not [[H3808]] remain [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of the LORD; [[H3069]] Ephraim [[H669]] will return [[H7725]] to Egypt [[H4714]] and eat [[H398]] unclean food [[H2931]] in Assyria. [[H804]] 
4 They will not [[H3808]] pour out [[H5258]] wine [offerings] [[H3196]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and their sacrifices [[H2077]] will not [[H3808]] please [[H6148]] Him,  [but will be] to them  like the bread [[H3899]] of mourners; [[H205]] all [[H3605]] who eat it [[H398]] will be defiled. [[H2930]] For [[H3588]] their bread [[H3899]] will be for themselves; [[H5315]] it will not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 What [[H4100]] will you do [[H6213]] on the appointed [[H4150]] day, [[H3117]] on the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] feast? [[H2282]] 
6 For [[H3588]] even if [[H2009]] they flee [[H1980]] destruction, [[H7701]] Egypt [[H4714]] will gather them [[H6908]] and Memphis [[H4644]] will bury them. [[H6912]] Their precious [[H4261]] silver [[H3701]] will be taken over [[H3423]] by thistles, [[H7057]] [and] thorns [will overrun] [[H2336]] their tents. [[H168]] 
7 The days [[H3117]] of punishment [[H6486]] have come; [[H935]] the days [[H3117]] of retribution [[H7966]] have arrived— [[H935]] let Israel [[H3478]] know it. [[H3045]] The prophet [[H5030]] is [called] a fool, [[H191]] and the inspired [[H7307]] man [[H376]] insane, [[H7696]] because of [[H5921]] the greatness [[H7230]] of your iniquity [[H5771]] and hostility. [[H4895]] 
8 The prophet [[H5030]] is Ephraim’s [[H669]] watchman, [[H6822]] along with [[H5973]] my God, [[H430]] [yet] the snare [[H6341]] of the fowler [[H3352]] [lies] on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] his paths. [[H1870]] Hostility [[H4895]] is in the house [[H1004]] of his God! [[H430]] 
9 They have deeply [[H6009]] corrupted themselves [[H7843]] as in the days [[H3117]] of Gibeah; [[H1390]] He will remember [[H2142]] their guilt; [[H5771]] He will punish [[H6485]] their sins. [[H2403]] 
10 I found [[H4672]] Israel [[H3478]] like grapes [[H6025]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] I saw [[H7200]] your fathers [[H1]] as the firstfruits [[H1063]] of the fig tree [[H8384]] in its first season. [[H7225]] But they [[H1992]] went [[H935]] to Baal-peor, [[H1187]] and consecrated [[H5144]] themselves to Shame; [[H1322]] so they became [[H1961]] as detestable [[H8251]] as the thing they loved. [[H157]] 
11 Ephraim’s [[H669]] glory [[H3519]] will fly away [[H5774]] like a bird, [[H5775]] with no birth, [[H3205]] no pregnancy, [[H990]] and no conception. [[H2032]] 
12 Even [[H3588]] if [[H518]] they raise [[H1431]] their children, [[H1121]] I will bereave them [[H7921]] of each one. [[H120]] Yes, [[H3588]] woe [be] [[H188]] to them  when I turn away [[H5493]] from them! [[H1992]] 
13 I have seen [[H7200]] Ephraim, [[H669]] like [[H834]] Tyre, [[H6865]] planted [[H8362]] in a meadow. [[H5116]] But Ephraim [[H669]] will bring out [[H3318]] his children [[H1121]] for slaughter. [[H2026]] 
14 Give [[H5414]] them,  O LORD— [[H3068]] what [[H4100]] will You give? [[H5414]] Give [[H5414]] them  wombs [[H7358]] that miscarry [[H7921]] and breasts [[H7699]] that dry up! [[H6784]] 
15 All [[H3605]] their evil [[H7451]] appears at Gilgal, [[H1537]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] I hated them. [[H8130]] I will drive them [[H1644]] from My house [[H1004]] for [[H5921]] the wickedness [[H7455]] of their deeds. [[H4611]] I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] love them; [[H160]] all [[H3605]] their leaders [[H8269]] are rebellious. [[H5637]] 
16 Ephraim [[H669]] is struck down; [[H5221]] their root [[H8328]] is withered; [[H3001]] they cannot bear [[H1077]] fruit. [[H6529]] Even [[H1571]] if [[H3588]] they bear children, [[H3205]] I will slay [[H4191]] the darlings [[H4261]] of their wombs. [[H990]] 
17 My God [[H430]] will reject them [[H3988]] because [[H3588]] they have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] Him;  and they shall be [[H1961]] wanderers [[H5074]] among the nations. [[H1471]]
