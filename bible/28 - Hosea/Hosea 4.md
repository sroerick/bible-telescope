# Hosea 4
[[Hosea 3|←]] • [[Hosea 5|→]]
1 Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] O children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has a case [[H7379]] against [[H5973]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land: [[H776]] There is no [[H369]] truth, [[H571]] no [[H369]] loving devotion, [[H2617]] and no [[H369]] knowledge [[H1847]] of God [[H430]] in the land! [[H776]] 
2 Cursing [[H422]] and lying, [[H3584]] murder [[H7523]] and stealing, [[H1589]] and adultery [[H5003]] are rampant; [[H6555]] one act of bloodshed [[H1818]] follows another. [[H5060]] 
3 Therefore [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] mourns, [[H56]] and all [[H3605]] who dwell [[H3427]] in it  will waste away [[H535]] with the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] and the birds [[H5775]] of the air; [[H8064]] even [[H1571]] the fish [[H1709]] of the sea [[H3220]] disappear. [[H622]] 
4 But [[H389]] let no [[H408]] man [[H376]] contend; [[H7378]] let no [[H408]] man [[H376]] offer reproof; [[H3198]] for your people [are] like those [[H5971]] who contend against [[H7378]] a priest. [[H3548]] 
5 You will stumble [[H3782]] by day, [[H3117]] and the prophet [[H5030]] will stumble [[H3782]] with you [[H5973]] by night. [[H3915]] So I will destroy [[H1820]] your mother— [[H517]] 
6 My people [[H5971]] are destroyed [[H1820]] for lack [[H1097]] of knowledge. [[H1847]] Because [[H3588]] you [[H859]] have rejected [[H3988]] knowledge, [[H1847]] I will also reject you [[H3988]] as My priests. [[H3547]] Since you have forgotten [[H7911]] the law [[H8451]] of your God, [[H430]] I [[H589]] will also [[H1571]] forget [[H7911]] your children. [[H1121]] 
7 The more they multiplied, [[H7235]] the more they sinned [[H2398]] against Me;  they exchanged [[H4171]] their Glory [[H3519]] for a thing of disgrace. [[H7036]] 
8 They feed on [[H398]] the sin [[H2403]] of My people [[H5971]] and set [[H5375]] their heart [[H5315]] on [[H413]] iniquity. [[H5771]] 
9 And it shall be [[H1961]] like people, [[H5971]] like priest. [[H3548]] I will punish [[H6485]] both of them [[H5921]] for their ways [[H1870]] and repay [[H7725]] them  for their deeds. [[H4611]] 
10 They will eat [[H398]] but not [[H3808]] be satisfied; [[H7646]] they will be promiscuous [[H2181]] but not [[H3808]] multiply. [[H6555]] For [[H3588]] they have stopped [[H5800]] obeying [[H8104]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 Promiscuity, [[H2184]] wine, [[H3196]] and new wine [[H8492]] take away [[H3947]] understanding. [[H3820]] 
12 My people [[H5971]] consult [[H7592]] their wooden idols, [[H6086]] and their divining rods [[H4731]] inform them. [[H5046]] For [[H3588]] a spirit [[H7307]] of prostitution [[H2183]] leads them astray [[H8582]] and they have played the harlot [[H2181]] against [[H8478]] their God. [[H430]] 
13 They sacrifice [[H2076]] on [[H5921]] the mountaintops [[H7218]] and burn offerings [[H6999]] on [[H5921]] the hills, [[H1389]] under [[H8478]] oak, [[H437]] poplar, [[H3839]] and terebinth, [[H424]] because [[H3588]] their shade [[H6738]] is pleasant. [[H2896]] And so [[H5921]] your daughters [[H1323]] turn to prostitution [[H2181]] and your daughters-in-law [[H3618]] to adultery. [[H5003]] 
14 I will not [[H3808]] punish [[H6485]] your daughters [[H1323]] when [[H3588]] they prostitute themselves [[H2181]] [or] [[H5921]] your daughters-in-law [[H3618]] when [[H3588]] they commit adultery, [[H5003]] because [[H3588]] the men themselves [[H1992]] go off [[H6504]] with [[H5973]] prostitutes [[H2181]] and make sacrifices [[H2076]] with [[H5973]] cult prostitutes. [[H6948]] So a people [[H5971]] without [[H3808]] understanding [[H995]] will come to ruin. [[H3832]] 
15 Though [[H518]] you [[H859]] prostitute yourself, [[H2181]] O Israel, [[H3478]] may Judah [[H3063]] avoid [[H408]] such guilt! [[H816]] Do not [[H408]] go [[H935]] to Gilgal, [[H1537]] do not go up [[H5927]] to Beth-aven, [[H1007]] and do not [[H408]] swear on oath, [[H7650]] ‘As surely as the LORD [[H3069]] lives!’ [[H2416]] 
16 For [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] is as obstinate [[H5637]] as a stubborn [[H5637]] heifer. [[H6510]] Can the LORD [[H3068]] now [[H6258]] shepherd them [[H7462]] like lambs [[H3532]] in an open meadow? [[H4800]] 
17 Ephraim [[H669]] is joined [[H2266]] to idols; [[H6091]] leave him alone! [[H3240]] 
18 When their liquor [[H5435]] is gone, [[H5493]] they turn to prostitution; [[H2181]] their rulers [[H4043]] dearly [[H157]] love [[H157]] disgrace. [[H7036]] 
19 The wind [[H7307]] has wrapped [[H6887]] them [[H853]] in its wings [[H3671]] and their sacrifices [[H2077]] will bring them shame. [[H954]]
