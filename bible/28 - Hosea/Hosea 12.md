# Hosea 12
[[Hosea 11|←]] • [[Hosea 13|→]]
1 Ephraim [[H669]] chases [[H7462]] the wind [[H7307]] and pursues [[H7291]] the east wind [[H6921]] all [[H3605]] day long; [[H3117]] he multiplies [[H7235]] lies [[H3577]] and violence; [[H7701]] he makes [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] Assyria [[H804]] and sends [[H2986]] olive oil [[H8081]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] 
2 The LORD also [brings] [[H3069]] a charge [[H7379]] against [[H5973]] Judah. [[H3063]] He will punish [[H6485]] Jacob [[H3290]] according to his ways [[H1870]] and repay [[H7725]] him  according to his deeds. [[H4611]] 
3 In the womb [[H990]] he grasped his brother’s [[H251]] heel, [[H6117]] and in his vigor [[H202]] he wrestled [[H8280]] with [[H854]] God. [[H430]] 
4 Yes, he struggled [[H7786]] with [[H413]] the Angel [[H4397]] and prevailed; [[H3201]] he wept [[H1058]] and sought His favor; [[H2603]] he found Him [[H4672]] at Bethel, [[H1008]] and there [[H8033]] He spoke [[H1696]] with us— [[H5973]] 
5 the LORD [[H3068]] is the God [[H430]] of Hosts— [[H6635]] the LORD [[H3068]] is His name of renown. [[H2143]] 
6 But you [[H859]] must return [[H7725]] to your God, [[H430]] maintaining [[H8104]] love [[H2617]] and justice, [[H4941]] and always [[H8548]] waiting [[H6960]] on [[H413]] your God. [[H430]] 
7 A merchant [[H3667]] loves [[H157]] to defraud [[H6231]] with dishonest [[H4820]] scales [[H3976]] in his hands. [[H3027]] 
8 And Ephraim [[H669]] boasts: [[H559]] “How rich I have become; [[H6238]] I have found [[H4672]] wealth [[H202]] for myself.  In all [[H3605]] my labors, [[H3018]] they can find [[H4672]] in me  no [[H3808]] iniquity [[H5771]] that [is] [[H834]] sin.” [[H2399]] 
9 But I [am] [[H595]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] ever since the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] I will again make you dwell [[H3427]] in tents, [[H168]] as in the days [[H3117]] of the appointed feast. [[H4150]] 
10 I spoke [[H1696]] through [[H5921]] the prophets [[H5030]] and [[H595]] multiplied [[H7235]] their visions; [[H2377]] I gave parables [[H1819]] through [[H3027]] the prophets. [[H5030]] 
11 Is there [[H518]] iniquity [[H205]] [in] Gilead? [[H1568]] They will surely [[H389]] come [[H1961]] to nothing. [[H7723]] Do they sacrifice [[H2076]] bulls [[H7794]] in Gilgal? [[H1537]] Indeed, [[H1571]] their altars [will be] [[H4196]] heaps of stones [[H1530]] in [[H5921]] the furrows [[H8525]] of the field. [[H7704]] 
12 Jacob [[H3290]] fled [[H1272]] to the land [[H7704]] of Aram, [[H758]] and Israel [[H3478]] worked [[H5647]] for a wife; [[H802]] for a wife [[H802]] he tended [sheep]. [[H8104]] 
13 But by a prophet [[H5030]] the LORD [[H3068]] brought [[H5927]] Israel [[H3478]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and by a prophet [[H5030]] he was preserved. [[H8104]] 
14 Ephraim [[H669]] has provoked bitter [[H8563]] anger, [[H3707]] so his Lord [[H136]] will leave [[H5203]] his bloodguilt [[H1818]] upon him [[H5921]] and repay [[H7725]] him  for his contempt. [[H2781]]
