# Hosea 10
[[Hosea 9|←]] • [[Hosea 11|→]]
1 Israel [[H3478]] was a luxuriant [[H1238]] vine, [[H1612]] yielding [[H7737]] fruit [[H6529]] for himself.  The more his fruit [[H6529]] increased, [[H7230]] the more he increased [[H7235]] the altars. [[H4196]] The better [[H2896]] his land produced, [[H776]] the better he made [[H3190]] the sacred pillars. [[H4676]] 
2 Their hearts [[H3820]] are devious; [[H2505]] now [[H6258]] they must bear their guilt. [[H816]] The LORD [[H1931]] will break down [[H6202]] their altars [[H4196]] and demolish [[H7703]] their sacred pillars. [[H4676]] 
3 Surely [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] they will say, [[H559]] “We have  no [[H369]] king, [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] we do not [[H3808]] revere [[H3372]] the LORD. [[H3068]] What [[H4100]] can a king [[H4428]] do [[H6213]] for us?”  
4 They speak [[H1696]] mere words; [[H1697]] with false [[H7723]] oaths [[H422]] they make [[H3772]] covenants. [[H1285]] So judgment [[H4941]] springs up [[H6524]] like poisonous weeds [[H7219]] in [[H5921]] the furrows [[H8525]] of a field. [[H7704]] 
5 The people [[H7934]] of Samaria [[H8111]] will fear [[H1481]] for the calf [[H5697]] of  Beth-aven. [[H1007]] Indeed, [[H3588]] its people [[H5971]] will mourn [[H56]] for it [[H5921]] with its idolatrous priests— [[H3649]] those who rejoiced [[H1523]] in [[H5921]] its glory— [[H3519]] for [[H3588]] it has been taken from them into exile. [[H1540]] 
6 Yes, [[H1571]] it will be carried [[H2986]] to Assyria [[H804]] as tribute [[H4503]] to the great [[H3377]] king. [[H4428]] Ephraim [[H669]] will be seized [[H3947]] with shame [[H1317]] and Israel [[H3478]] ashamed [[H954]] of its wooden idols. [[H6098]] 
7 Samaria [[H8111]] will be carried off [[H1820]] [with] her king [[H4428]] like a twig [[H7110]] on [[H5921]] the surface [[H6440]] of the water. [[H4325]] 
8 The high places [[H1116]] of Aven, [[H205]] the sin [[H2403]] of Israel, [[H3478]] will be destroyed; [[H8045]] thorns [[H6975]] and thistles [[H1863]] will grow [[H5927]] over [[H5921]] their altars. [[H4196]] Then they will say [[H559]] to the mountains, [[H2022]] “Cover us!” [[H3680]] and to the hills, [[H1389]] “Fall [[H5307]] on us!” [[H5921]] 
9 Since the days [[H3117]] of Gibeah [[H1390]] you have sinned, [[H2398]] O Israel, [[H3478]] and there [[H8033]] you have remained. [[H5975]] Did not [[H3808]] the battle [[H4421]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] overtake [[H5381]] the sons [[H1121]] of iniquity? [[H5932]] 
10 I will chasten them [[H3256]] when I please; [[H185]] nations [[H5971]] will be gathered [[H622]] against them [[H5921]] to put them in bondage [[H631]] for their double [[H8147]] transgression. [[H5868]] 
11 Ephraim [[H669]] is a well-trained [[H3925]] heifer [[H5697]] that loves [[H157]] to thresh; [[H1758]] but I [[H589]] will place a yoke [[H5674]] on [[H5921]] her fair [[H2898]] neck. [[H6676]] I will harness [[H7392]] Ephraim, [[H669]] Judah [[H3063]] will plow, [[H2790]] [and] Jacob [[H3290]] will break the hard ground. [[H7702]] 
12 Sow [[H2232]] for yourselves  righteousness [[H6666]] and reap the fruit [[H7114]] of loving devotion; [[H2617]] break up [[H5214]] your  unplowed ground. [[H5215]] For [it is] time [[H6256]] to seek [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3069]] until [[H5704]] He comes [[H935]] and sends righteousness [[H6664]] upon you  like rain. [[H3384]] 
13 You have plowed [[H2790]] wickedness [[H7562]] and reaped [[H7114]] injustice; [[H5766]] you have eaten [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of lies. [[H3585]] Because [[H3588]] you have trusted [[H982]] in your own way [[H1870]] and in the multitude [[H7230]] of your mighty men, [[H1368]] 
14 the roar of battle [[H7588]] will rise [[H6965]] against your people, [[H5971]] so that all [[H3605]] your fortresses [[H4013]] will be demolished [[H7703]] as Shalman [[H8020]] devastated [[H7701]] Beth-arbel [[H1009]] in the day [[H3117]] of battle, [[H4421]] when mothers [[H517]] were dashed to pieces [[H7376]] along with [[H5921]] their children. [[H1121]] 
15 Thus [[H3602]] it will be done [[H6213]] to you,  O Bethel, [[H1008]] because of [[H6440]] your great [[H7451]] wickedness. [[H7451]] When the day dawns, [[H7837]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] will be utterly [[H1820]] cut off. [[H1820]]
