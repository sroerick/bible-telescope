# Hosea 6
[[Hosea 5|←]] • [[Hosea 7|→]]
1 Come, [[H1980]] let us return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] has torn us to pieces, [[H2963]] but He will heal us; [[H7495]] He has wounded us, [[H5221]] but He will bind us up. [[H2280]] 
2 After two days [[H3117]] He will revive us; [[H2421]] on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] He will raise us up, [[H6965]] that we may live [[H2421]] in His presence. [[H6440]] 
3 So let us know— [[H3045]] let us press [[H7291]] on to know [[H3045]] the LORD. [[H3068]] As surely as [[H3559]] the sun rises, [[H7837]] He will appear; [[H4161]] He will come [[H935]] to us  like the rain, [[H1653]] like the spring showers [[H4456]] that water [[H3138]] the earth. [[H776]] 
4 What [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] with you,  O Ephraim? [[H669]] What [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] with you,  O Judah? [[H3063]] For your loyalty [[H2617]] is like a morning [[H1242]] mist, [[H6051]] like the early [[H7925]] dew [[H2919]] that vanishes. [[H1980]] 
5 Therefore [[H5921]] I have hewn [them] [[H2672]] by the prophets; [[H5030]] I have slain them [[H2026]] by the words [[H561]] of My mouth, [[H6310]] and My judgments [[H4941]] go forth [[H3318]] like lightning. [[H216]] 
6 For [[H3588]] I desire [[H2654]] mercy, [[H2617]] not [[H3808]] sacrifice, [[H2077]] and the knowledge [[H1847]] of God [[H430]] rather than burnt offerings. [[H5930]] 
7 But they, [[H1992]] like Adam, [[H121]] have transgressed [[H5674]] the covenant; [[H1285]] there [[H8033]] they were unfaithful [[H898]] to Me.  
8 Gilead [[H1568]] is a city [[H7151]] of evildoers, [[H6466]] tracked with footprints [[H6121]] of blood. [[H1818]] 
9 Like raiders [[H1416]] who lie in ambush, [[H2442]] [so does] a band [[H2267]] of priests; [[H3548]] they murder [[H7523]] on the way [[H1870]] to Shechem; [[H7927]] surely [[H3588]] they have committed [[H6213]] atrocities. [[H2154]] 
10 In the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] I have seen [[H7200]] a horrible thing: [[H8186]] There [[H8033]] Ephraim [[H669]] practices prostitution [[H2184]] [and] Israel [[H3478]] is defiled. [[H2930]] 
11 Also [[H1571]] for you,  O Judah, [[H3063]] a harvest [[H7105]] is appointed, [[H7896]] when I will restore [[H7725]] My people [[H5971]] from captivity. [[H7622]]
