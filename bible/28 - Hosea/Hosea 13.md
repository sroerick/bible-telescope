# Hosea 13
[[Hosea 12|←]] • [[Hosea 14|→]]
1 When Ephraim [[H669]] spoke, [[H1696]] there was trembling; [[H7578]] he [[H1931]] was exalted [[H5375]] in Israel. [[H3478]] But he incurred guilt [[H816]] through Baal, [[H1168]] and he died. [[H4191]] 
2 Now [[H6258]] they sin [[H2398]] more and more [[H3254]] and make [[H6213]] for themselves  cast images, [[H4541]] idols [[H6091]] skillfully made [[H8394]] from their silver, [[H3701]] all [[H3605]] of them  the work [[H4639]] of craftsmen. [[H2796]] People [[H1992]] say of them, [[H559]] “Let the men [[H120]] who offer human sacrifice [[H2076]] kiss [[H5401]] the calves!” [[H5695]] 
3 Therefore [[H3651]] they will be [[H1961]] like the morning [[H1242]] mist, [[H6051]] like the early [[H7925]] dew [[H2919]] that vanishes, [[H1980]] like chaff [[H4671]] blown [[H5590]] from a threshing floor, [[H1637]] and like smoke [[H6227]] through an open window. [[H699]] 
4 Yet I [am] [[H595]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] ever since the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] you know [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] God [[H430]] but Me, [[H2108]] for [there is] no [[H369]] Savior [[H3467]] besides Me. [[H1115]] 
5 I [[H589]] knew you [[H3045]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] in the land [[H776]] of drought. [[H8514]] 
6 When they had pasture, [[H4830]] they became satisfied; [[H7646]] when they were satisfied, [[H7646]] their hearts [[H3820]] became proud. [[H7311]] As a result, [[H5921]] they forgot Me. [[H7911]] 
7 So I will pounce [[H1961]] on them  like [[H3644]] a lion; [[H7826]] like a leopard [[H5246]] on [[H5921]] the path [[H1870]] I will lurk. [[H7789]] 
8 Like a bear [[H1677]] robbed of her cubs, [[H7909]] I will attack them, [[H6298]] and I will tear [[H7167]] open their chests. [[H5458]] There [[H8033]] I will devour them [[H398]] like a lion, [[H3833]] like a wild [[H7704]] beast [[H2416]] would tear them apart. [[H1234]] 
9 [It is] your destruction, [[H7843]] O Israel, [[H3478]] because you are [[H3588]] against Me,  your helper. [[H5828]] 
10 Where [[H165]] is your king [[H4428]] now [[H645]] to save you [[H3467]] in all [[H3605]] your cities, [[H5892]] and the rulers [[H8199]] to whom [[H834]] you said, [[H559]] “Give [[H5414]] me  a king [[H4428]] and princes”? [[H8269]] 
11 So in My anger [[H639]] I gave [[H5414]] you  a king, [[H4428]] and in My wrath [[H5678]] I took [him] away. [[H3947]] 
12 The iniquity [[H5771]] of Ephraim [[H669]] [is] bound up; [[H6887]] his sin [[H2403]] [is] stored up. [[H6845]] 
13 Labor [[H3205]] pains [[H2256]] come [[H935]] upon him,  but he is [[H1931]] an unwise [[H2450]] son. [[H1121]] When [[H3588]] the time has arrived, [[H6256]] he [[H1121]] does not [[H3808]] present himself [[H5975]] at the opening of the womb. [[H4866]] 
14 I will ransom them [[H6299]] from the power [[H3027]] of Sheol; [[H7585]] I will redeem them [[H1350]] from Death. [[H4194]] Where, [[H165]] O Death, [[H4194]] are your plagues? [[H1698]] Where, [[H165]] O Sheol, [[H7585]] is your sting? [[H6987]] Compassion [[H5164]] is hidden [[H5641]] from My eyes. [[H5869]] 
15 Although [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] flourishes [[H6500]] among [[H996]] his brothers, [[H251]] an east wind [[H6921]] will come, [[H935]] a wind [[H7307]] from the LORD [[H3068]] rising up [[H5927]] from the desert. [[H4057]] His fountain [[H4726]] will fail, [[H954]] and his spring [[H4599]] will run dry. [[H2717]] The wind [[H1931]] will plunder [[H8154]] his treasury [[H214]] of every [[H3605]] precious [[H2532]] article. [[H3627]] 
16 Samaria [[H8111]] will bear her guilt [[H816]] because [[H3588]] she has rebelled [[H4784]] against her God. [[H430]] They will fall [[H5307]] by the sword; [[H2719]] their little ones [[H5768]] will be dashed to pieces, [[H7376]] and their pregnant [[H2030]] women ripped open. [[H1234]]
