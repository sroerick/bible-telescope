[[Colossians 1|←]] • [[Colossians 3|→]]
1 I want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to know [[G1492]] how much [[G2245]] I am struggling [[G2192]] for [[G5228]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] [for] those [[G3588]] at [[G1722]] Laodicea, [[G2993]] and [[G2532]] for all who [[G3745]] have not met [[G3708]] me [[G1473]] face to face, [[G4383]] 
2 that [[G2443]] they may be encouraged [[G3870]] in heart, [[G2588]] knit together [[G4822]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] and [[G2532]] filled with [[G1519]] [the] full riches [[G4149]] of complete [[G4136]] understanding, [[G4907]] so that [[G1519]] they may know [[G1922]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of God, [[G2316]] [namely] Christ, [[G5547]] 
3 in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] are [[G1510]] hidden [[G614]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] treasures [[G2344]] of wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] knowledge. [[G1108]] 
4 I say [[G3004]] this [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] no one [[G3367]] will deceive [[G3884]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] smooth rhetoric. [[G4086]] 
5 For [[G1063]] although [[G2532]] I am absent from you [[G548]] in [[G3588]] body, [[G4561]] I am present [[G1510]] with [[G4862]] you [[G4771]] in spirit, [[G4151]] [and] I delight [[G5463]] to see [[G991]] your [[G4771]] orderly condition [[G5010]] and [[G2532]] firm [[G4733]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1519]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
6 Therefore, [[G3767]] just as [[G5613]] you have received [[G3880]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] [as] [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] continue to live [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] Him, [[G846]] 
7 rooted [[G4492]] and [[G2532]] built up [[G2026]] in [[G1722]] Him, [[G846]] established in [[G950]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] as [[G2531]] you were taught, [[G1321]] [and] overflowing [[G4052]] with [[G1722]] thankfulness. [[G2169]] 
8 See to it [[G991]] that no one [[G3361]] takes you captive [[G4812]] through [[G1223]] philosophy [[G5385]] and [[G2532]] empty [[G2756]] deception, [[G539]] which are based on [[G2596]] human [[G444]] tradition [[G3862]] [and] [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] spiritual forces [[G4747]] of the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] rather than [[G3756]] on [[G2596]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
9 For [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] [Christ] [[G846]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] fullness [[G4138]] of the [[G3588]] Deity [[G2320]] dwells [[G2730]] in bodily form. [[G4985]] 
10 And [[G2532]] you have been [[G1510]] made complete [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] [Christ], [[G846]] who [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] over every [[G3956]] ruler [[G746]] and [[G2532]] authority. [[G1849]] 
11 In [[G1722]] Him [[G3739]] you were also circumcised [[G4059]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] putting off [[G555]] of [your] [[G3588]] sinful nature, [[G4561]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] circumcision [[G4061]] [performed] by Christ [[G5547]] [and] [[G4061]] not by human hands. [[G886]] 
12 And [[G2532]] having been buried with [[G4916]] Him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] baptism, [[G909]] you were raised with [Him] [[G4891]] through [[G1223]] [your] [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] in the [[G3588]] power [[G1753]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] raised [[G1453]] Him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]] 
13 [When] [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] were [[G1510]] dead [[G3498]] in [[G1722]] [your] [[G3588]] trespasses [[G3900]] and [[G2532]] in the [[G3588]] uncircumcision [[G203]] of your [[G4771]] sinful nature, [[G4561]] God made you alive [[G4806]] with [[G4862]] [Christ]. [[G846]] He forgave [[G5483]] us [[G1473]] all [[G3956]] [our] [[G3588]] trespasses, [[G3900]] 
14 having canceled [[G1813]] the [[G3588]] debt ascribed [[G5498]] to [[G2596]] us [[G1473]] in the [[G3588]] decrees [[G1378]] that [[G3739]] stood [[G1510]] against [[G5227]] us. [[G1473]] He took [[G142]] it [[G846]] away, [[G1537]] nailing [[G4338]] it [[G846]] to the [[G3588]] cross! [[G4716]] 
15 [And] having disarmed [[G554]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G746]] and [[G2532]] authorities, [[G1849]] He made a public spectacle [of them], [[G1165]] triumphing [[G2358]] over them [[G846]] by [[G1722]] [the cross]. [[G846]] 
16 Therefore [[G3767]] {let} no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] judge [[G2919]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] what you eat [[G1035]] or [[G2532]] drink, [[G4213]] or [[G2228]] with [[G1722]] regard [[G3313]] to a festival, [[G1859]] a New Moon, [[G3561]] or [[G2228]] a Sabbath. [[G4521]] 
17 These [[G3739]] are [[G1510]] a shadow [[G4639]] of the things [[G3588]] to come, [[G3195]] but [[G1161]] [the] body [ that casts it ] [[G4983]] belongs to [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
18 [Do not let anyone] [[G3367]] who delights [[G2309]] in [[G1722]] [false] humility [[G5012]] and [[G2532]] [the] worship [[G2356]] of angels [[G32]] disqualify [[G2603]] you [[G4771]] with speculation about [[G1687]] what [[G3739]] he has seen. [[G3708]] [Such a man] is puffed up [[G5448]] without basis [[G1500]] by [[G5259]] his [[G846]] unspiritual [[G4561]] mind, [[G3563]] 
19 and [[G2532]] he loses connection [[G2902]] to the [[G3588]] head, [[G2776]] from [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] body, [[G4983]] supported [[G2023]] and [[G2532]] knit together [[G4822]] by [[G1223]] [its] [[G3588]] joints [[G860]] and [[G2532]] ligaments, [[G4886]] grows [[G837]] as [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] causes it to grow. [[G838]] 
20 If [[G1487]] you have died [[G599]] with [[G4862]] Christ [[G5547]] to [[G575]] the [[G3588]] spiritual forces [[G4747]] of the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] why, [[G5101]] as though [[G5613]] you still belonged [[G2198]] to [[G1722]] [the] world, [[G2889]] do you submit to [its] regulations: [[G1379]] 
21 “{Do} [[G3361]] not handle, [[G680]] {do} [[G3366]] not taste, [[G1089]] {do} [[G3366]] not touch!”? [[G2345]] 
22 [These] [[G3739]] will [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] perish [[G5356]] with [[G3588]] use, [[G671]] because they are based on [[G2596]] human [[G444]] commands [[G1778]] and [[G2532]] teachings. [[G1319]] 
23 Such [restrictions] [[G3748]] indeed [[G3303]] have [[G2192]] an appearance [[G3056]] of wisdom, [[G4678]] with [their] [[G1722]] self-prescribed worship, [[G1479]] [their false] humility, [[G5012]] and [[G2532]] [their] harsh treatment [[G857]] of [the] body; [[G4983]] [but] they are [[G1510]] of [[G1722]] no [[G3756]] value [[G5092]] against [[G4314]] [the] indulgence [[G4140]] of the [[G3588]] flesh.
