[[Philippians 4|←]] • [[Colossians 2|→]]
1 Paul, [[G3972]] an apostle [[G652]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] by [[G1223]] [the] will [[G2307]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Timothy [[G5095]] [our] [[G3588]] brother, [[G80]] 
2 To the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] in [[G1722]] Colossae, [[G2857]] [the] faithful [[G4103]] brothers [[G80]] in [[G1722]] Christ: [[G5547]] Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Father. [[G3962]] 
3 We always thank [[G2168]] God, [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] when we pray [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] you, [[G4771]] 
4 because we have heard about [[G191]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] your [[G2192]] love [[G26]] for [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] 
5 springing from [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] that [[G3588]] is stored up [[G606]] for you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] [and] that [[G3739]] you already heard about [[G4257]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of truth, [[G225]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] 
6 that [[G3588]] has come [[G3918]] to [[G1519]] you. [[G4771]] All [[G3956]] over [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] [this gospel] is [[G1510]] bearing fruit [[G2592]] and [[G2532]] growing, [[G837]] just as [[G2531]] [it has been doing] [[G2532]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] since [[G575]] the [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] you heard [it] [[G191]] and [[G2532]] truly [[G225]] understood [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of God. [[G2316]] 
7 You learned [it] [[G3129]] from [[G575]] Epaphras, [[G1889]] our [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] fellow servant, [[G4889]] who [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] a faithful [[G4103]] minister [[G1249]] of Christ [[G5547]] on our [[G1473]] behalf, [[G5228]] 
8 [and] who [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] informed [[G1213]] us [[G1473]] of your [[G4771]] love [[G26]] in [[G1722]] [the] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
9 For this reason, [[G1223]] since [[G575]] the [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] we heard [about you], [[G191]] we [[G1473]] {have} not [[G3756]] stopped [[G3973]] praying [[G4336]] for [[G5228]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] asking [[G154]] [God] to [[G2443]] fill you with [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1922]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] will [[G2307]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] spiritual [[G4152]] wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] understanding, [[G4907]] 
10 so that you may walk [[G4043]] in a manner worthy [[G516]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] [and] may please [Him] [[G699]] in [[G1519]] every way: [[G3956]] bearing fruit [[G2592]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work, [[G2041]] growing [[G837]] in the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1922]] of God, [[G2316]] 
11 being strengthened [[G1412]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] power [[G1411]] according to [[G2596]] His [[G846]] glorious [[G1391]] might [[G2904]] so that you may have [[G1519]] full [[G3956]] endurance [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] patience, [[G3115]] [and] joyfully [[G3326]] 
12 giving thanks [[G2168]] to the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] has qualified [[G2427]] you [[G4771]] to share [[G3310]] in the [[G3588]] inheritance [[G2819]] of the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light. [[G5457]] 
13 He [[G3739]] has rescued [[G4506]] us [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dominion [[G1849]] of darkness [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] brought [us] [[G3179]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] beloved [[G26]] Son, [[G5207]] 
14 in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] we have [[G2192]] redemption, [[G629]] the [[G3588]] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins. [[G266]] 
15 [The Son] [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] image [[G1504]] of the [[G3588]] invisible [[G517]] God, [[G2316]] [the] firstborn [[G4416]] over all [[G3956]] creation. [[G2937]] 
16 For [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] all things [[G3956]] were created, [[G2936]] [things] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] visible [[G3707]] and [[G2532]] invisible, [[G517]] whether [[G1535]] thrones [[G2362]] or [[G1535]] dominions [[G2963]] or [[G1535]] rulers [[G746]] or [[G1535]] authorities. [[G1849]] All things [[G3956]] were created [[G2936]] through [[G1223]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] Him. [[G846]] 
17 He [[G846]] is [[G1510]] before [[G4253]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] all things [[G3956]] hold together. [[G4921]] 
18 And [[G2532]] He [[G846]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] of the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] the [[G3588]] church; [[G1577]] He [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] beginning [[G746]] [and] firstborn [[G4416]] from among [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] so that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] all things [[G3956]] He [[G846]] may [[G1096]] have preeminence. [[G4409]] 
19 For [[G3754]] [God] was pleased [to have] [[G2106]] all [[G3956]] [His] [[G3588]] fullness [[G4138]] dwell [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] Him, [[G846]] 
20 and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] Him [[G846]] to reconcile [[G604]] to [[G1519]] Himself [[G846]] all things, [[G3956]] whether [[G1535]] things [[G3588]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] or [[G1535]] things [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] by making peace [[G1517]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] cross. [[G4716]] 
21 Once [[G4218]] you [[G4771]] were [[G1510]] alienated [ from God ] [[G526]] and [[G2532]] were hostile [[G2190]] in [[G3588]] your minds [[G1271]] because of [[G1722]] [your] [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] deeds. [[G2041]] 
22 But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] He has reconciled [you] [[G604]] by [[G1722]] [Christ’s] [[G846]] physical [[G4561]] body [[G4983]] through [[G1223]] death [[G2288]] to present [[G3936]] you [[G4771]] holy, [[G40]] unblemished, [[G299]] and [[G2532]] blameless [[G410]] in His presence— [[G2714]] 
23 if [[G1487]] indeed [[G1065]] you continue [[G1961]] in [your] faith, [[G4102]] established [[G2311]] and [[G2532]] firm, [[G1476]] not [[G3361]] moved [[G3334]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] of the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] you heard, [[G191]] which [[G3588]] has been proclaimed [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] creation [[G2937]] under [[G5259]] heaven, [[G3772]] [and] of which [[G3739]] I, [[G1473]] Paul, [[G3972]] have become [[G1096]] a servant. [[G1249]] 
24 Now [[G3568]] I rejoice [[G5463]] in [[G1722]] [my] [[G3588]] sufferings [[G3804]] for you, [[G5228]] and [[G2532]] I fill up [[G466]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] flesh [[G4561]] what [[G3588]] is lacking [[G5303]] in regard to [[G3588]] Christ’s [[G5547]] afflictions [[G2347]] for the sake of [[G5228]] His [[G846]] body, [[G4983]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]] 
25 I [[G1473]] became [[G1096]] its [[G3739]] servant [[G1249]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] commission [[G3622]] God [[G2316]] gave [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] to fully proclaim [[G4137]] to [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God, [[G2316]] 
26 the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] that [[G3588]] was hidden [[G613]] for [[G575]] ages [[G165]] and [[G2532]] generations [[G1074]] but [[G1161]] is now revealed [[G5319]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] saints, [[G40]] 
27 to whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has chosen [[G2309]] to make known [[G1107]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] the [[G3588]] glorious [[G1391]] riches [[G4149]] of this [[G3778]] mystery, [[G3466]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] Christ [[G5547]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] of [[G3588]] glory. [[G1391]] 
28 We [[G1473]] proclaim [[G2605]] Him, [[G3739]] admonishing [[G3560]] and [[G2532]] teaching [[G1321]] everyone [[G3956]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] wisdom, [[G4678]] so that [[G2443]] we may present [[G3936]] everyone [[G3956]] perfect [[G5046]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
29 To [[G1519]] this end [[G3739]] I labor, [[G2872]] striving [[G75]] with all [[G2596]] His [[G846]] energy [[G1753]] working [[G1754]] powerfully [[G1411]] within [[G1722]] me. [[G1473]]
