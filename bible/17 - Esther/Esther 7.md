1 So the king [[H4428]] and Haman [[H2001]] went [[H935]] to dine [[H8354]] with [[H5973]] Esther [[H635]] the queen, [[H4436]] 
2 and as they drank [[H4960]] their wine [[H3196]] on the second [[H8145]] day, [[H3117]] the king [[H4428]] asked [[H559]] once more, [[H1571]] “Queen [[H4436]] Esther, [[H635]] what [is] [[H4100]] your petition? [[H7596]] It will be given [[H5414]] to you.  What [is] [[H4100]] your request? [[H1246]] Even up to [[H5704]] half [[H2677]] the kingdom, [[H4438]] it will be fulfilled.” [[H6213]] 
3 Then Queen [[H4436]] Esther [[H635]] replied, [[H6030]] “If [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your sight, [[H5869]] O king, [[H4428]] and if [[H518]] it pleases [[H2895]] the king, [[H4428]] grant [[H5414]] me  my life [[H5315]] as my petition, [[H7596]] and [the lives of] my people [[H5971]] as my request. [[H1246]] 
4 For [[H3588]] my people [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] have been sold out [[H4376]] to destruction, [[H8045]] death, [[H2026]] and annihilation. [[H6]] If [[H432]] we had merely been sold [[H4376]] as menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H8198]] I would have held my peace, [[H2790]] because [[H3588]] no [[H369]] such distress [[H6862]] would justify [[H7737]] burdening [[H5143]] the king.” [[H4428]] 
5 Then King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] spoke up [[H559]] and asked [[H559]] Queen [[H4436]] Esther, [[H635]] “Who [[H4310]] is this, [[H2088]] and where [[H335]] is the one [[H1931]] who [[H834]] would [[H4390]] devise [[H6213]] such a scheme?” [[H3651]] 
6 Esther [[H635]] replied, [[H559]] “The adversary [[H6862]] and enemy [[H341]] is this [[H2088]] wicked man— [[H7451]] Haman!” [[H2001]] And Haman [[H2001]] stood in terror [[H1204]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] and queen. [[H4436]] 
7 In his fury, [[H2534]] the king [[H4428]] arose [[H6965]] from drinking [[H4960]] his wine [[H3196]] and went to [[H413]] the palace [[H1055]] garden, [[H1594]] while Haman [[H2001]] stayed behind [[H5975]] to beg [[H1245]] Queen [[H4436]] Esther [[H635]] for [[H5921]] his life, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] he realized [[H7200]] the king [[H4428]] was planning [[H3615]] a terrible fate [[H7451]] for him. [[H413]] 
8 Just as the king [[H4428]] returned [[H7725]] from the palace [[H1055]] garden [[H1594]] to [[H413]] the banquet hall, [[H1004]] Haman [[H2001]] was falling [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] the couch [[H4296]] where [[H834]] Esther [[H635]] [was reclining]. [[H5921]] The king [[H4428]] exclaimed, [[H559]] “Would he actually [[H1571]] assault [[H3533]] the queen [[H4436]] while [[H5973]] I am in the palace?” [[H1004]] As soon as the words [[H1697]] had left [[H3318]] the king's [[H4428]] mouth, [[H6310]] they covered [[H2645]] Haman's [[H2001]] face. [[H6440]] 
9 Then Harbonah, [[H2726]] one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] the eunuchs [[H5631]] attending [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] said: [[H559]] “There [[H2009]] is a gallows [[H6086]] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] high [[H1364]] at Haman's [[H2001]] house. [[H1004]] [He] [[H2001]] had it built [[H6213]] for Mordecai, [[H4782]] who [[H834]] gave the report [[H1696]] that saved [[H2896]] the king. [[H4428]] “Hang [[H8518]] him on it! [[H5921]] declared [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]] 
10 So they hanged [[H8518]] Haman [[H2001]] on [[H5921]] the gallows [[H6086]] he had prepared [[H3559]] for Mordecai. [[H4782]] Then the fury [[H2534]] of the king [[H4428]] subsided. [[H7918]]
