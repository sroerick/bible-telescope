1 On the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] Esther [[H635]] put on [[H3847]] [her] royal [attire] [[H4438]] and stood [[H5975]] in the inner [[H6442]] courtyard [[H2691]] of the palace [[H1004]] across from [[H5227]] the king's [[H4428]] quarters. [[H1004]] The king [[H4428]] was sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his royal [[H4438]] throne [[H3678]] in the royal [[H4438]] courtroom, [[H1004]] facing [[H5227]] the [[H1004]] entrance. [[H6607]] 
2 As soon as the king [[H4428]] saw [[H7200]] Queen [[H4436]] Esther [[H635]] standing [[H5975]] in the courtyard, [[H2691]] she found [[H5375]] favor [[H2580]] in his sight. [[H5869]] The king [[H4428]] extended [[H3447]] the gold [[H2091]] scepter [[H8275]] in his hand [[H3027]] toward Esther, [[H635]] and she [[H635]] approached [[H7126]] and touched [[H5060]] the tip [[H7218]] of the scepter. [[H8275]] 
3 “What [[H4100]] is it,  Queen [[H4436]] Esther?” [[H635]] the king [[H4428]] inquired. [[H559]] “What [is] [[H4100]] your request? [[H1246]] Even up to [[H5704]] half [[H2677]] the kingdom, [[H4438]] it will be given [[H5414]] to you.”  
4 “If [[H518]] it pleases [[H5921]] the king,” [[H4428]] Esther [[H635]] replied, [[H559]] “may the king [[H4428]] and Haman [[H2001]] come [[H935]] today [[H3117]] to [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] I have prepared [[H6213]] for [the king].”  
5 “Hurry,” [[H4116]] commanded [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] “and bring Haman, [[H2001]] so we can do [[H6213]] as Esther [[H635]] has requested.” [[H1697]] So the king [[H4428]] and Haman [[H2001]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] that [[H834]] Esther [[H635]] had prepared. [[H6213]] 
6 And as they drank [[H4960]] their wine, [[H3196]] the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to Esther, [[H635]] “What [[H4100]] is your petition? [[H7596]] It will be given [[H5414]] to you.  What [is] [[H4100]] your request? [[H1246]] Even up to [[H5704]] half [[H2677]] the kingdom, [[H4438]] it will be fulfilled.” [[H6213]] 
7 Esther [[H635]] replied, [[H6030]] “This is my petition [[H7596]] and my request: [[H1246]] 
8 If [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the king, [[H4428]] and if [[H518]] it pleases [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] to grant [[H5414]] my petition [[H7596]] and fulfill [[H6213]] my request, [[H1246]] may the king [[H4428]] and Haman [[H2001]] come [[H935]] tomorrow [[H4279]] to [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] I will prepare [[H6213]] for them.  Then I will answer [[H6213]] the king's [[H4428]] question. [[H1697]] 
9 That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Haman [[H2001]] went out [[H3318]] full of joy [[H8056]] and glad [[H2896]] of heart. [[H3820]] At the King’s [[H4428]] Gate, however, [[H8179]] [he] [[H2001]] saw [[H7200]] Mordecai, [[H4782]] who did not [[H3808]] rise [[H6965]] or tremble in fear [[H2111]] at his presence. [[H4480]] And Haman [[H2001]] was filled [[H4390]] with rage [[H2534]] toward [[H5921]] Mordecai. [[H4782]] 
10 Nevertheless, Haman [[H2001]] restrained himself [[H662]] and went [[H935]] home. [[H1004]] And calling for [[H7971]] his friends [[H157]] and his wife [[H802]] Zeresh, [[H2238]] 
11 Haman [[H2001]] recounted [[H5608]] to them [[H1992]] his glorious [[H3519]] wealth, [[H6239]] his many [[H7230]] sons, [[H1121]] and [[H853]] all the ways [[H3605]] the king [[H4428]] had honored [[H1431]] and promoted him [[H5375]] over [[H5921]] the other officials [[H8269]] and servants. [[H5650]] 
12 “What is more,” [[H637]] Haman [[H2001]] added, [[H559]] “Queen [[H4436]] Esther [[H635]] invited [[H935]] no [[H3808]] one [[H3588]] but [[H518]] me [[H853]] to join [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] at [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] she prepared, [[H6213]] and I [[H589]] am invited [[H7121]] back [[H1571]] tomorrow [[H4279]] along with [[H5973]] the king. [[H4428]] 
13 Yet none [[H3605]] of this [[H2088]] satisfies [[H7737]] me  as [[H3605]] long [[H6256]] as [[H834]] I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew [[H3064]] sitting [[H3427]] at the King’s [[H4428]] Gate.” [[H8179]] 
14 His wife [[H802]] Zeresh [[H2238]] and all [[H3605]] his friends [[H157]] told [[H559]] him,  “Have them build [[H6213]] a gallows [[H6086]] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H1364]] and ask [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] in the morning [[H1242]] to have Mordecai [[H4782]] hanged [[H8518]] on it. [[H5921]] Then go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] and enjoy yourself. [[H8056]] The advice [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] Haman, [[H2001]] and he had the gallows [[H6086]] constructed. [[H6213]]
