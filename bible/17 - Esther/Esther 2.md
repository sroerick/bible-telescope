1 Some time later, [[H310]] when the anger [[H2534]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] had subsided, [[H7918]] he recalled [[H2142]] Vashti [[H2060]] and [[H853]] what [[H834]] she had done, [[H6213]] and [[H853]] what [[H834]] had been decreed [[H1504]] against her. [[H5921]] 
2 Then the king's [[H4428]] attendants [[H5288]] proposed, [[H559]] “Let a search be made [[H1245]] for beautiful [[H2896]] young [[H5291]] virgins [[H1330]] for the king, [[H4428]] 
3 and let the king [[H4428]] appoint [[H6485]] commissioners [[H6496]] in each [[H3605]] province [[H4082]] of his kingdom [[H4438]] to assemble [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the beautiful [[H2896]] young [[H5291]] women [[H1330]] into [[H413]] the harem [[H1004]] at [[H413]] the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa. [[H7800]] Let them be placed [[H413]] under the care [[H3027]] of Hegai, [[H1896]] the king’s [[H4428]] eunuch [[H5631]] in charge of [[H8104]] the women, [[H802]] and give them [[H5414]] the required beauty treatments. [[H8562]] 
4 Then let the young woman [[H5291]] who [[H834]] pleases [[H3190]] the king [[H4428]] become queen [[H4427]] in place [[H8478]] of Vashti.” [[H2060]] This suggestion [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] the king, [[H4428]] and he acted [[H6213]] accordingly. [[H3651]] 
5 [Now] there was [[H1961]] at the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa [[H7800]] a Jewish [[H3064]] man [[H376]] from the tribe of Benjamin [[H1145]] named [[H8034]] Mordecai [[H4782]] son [[H1121]] of Jair, [[H2971]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimei, [[H8096]] the son [[H1121]] of Kish. [[H7027]] 
6 He [[H834]] had been carried into exile [[H1540]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] by Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] among [[H5973]] those taken captive [[H1473]] with [[H5973]] Jeconiah [[H3204]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
7 And [Mordecai] [[H1961]] had brought up [[H539]] Hadassah [[H1919]] (that is, [[H1931]] Esther), [[H635]] the daughter [[H1323]] of his uncle, [[H1730]] because [[H3588]] she did not [[H369]] have a father [[H1]] or mother. [[H517]] The young woman [[H5291]] was lovely [[H3303]] in form [[H8389]] and [[H2896]] appearance, [[H4758]] and when her father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] had died, [[H4194]] Mordecai [[H4782]] had taken her in [[H3947]] as his own  daughter. [[H1323]] 
8 When [[H1961]] the king’s [[H4428]] command [[H1697]] and edict [[H1881]] had been proclaimed, [[H8085]] many [[H7227]] young women [[H5291]] gathered [[H6908]] at [[H413]] the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa [[H7800]] under [[H413]] the care [[H3027]] of Hegai. [[H1896]] Esther [[H635]] was also taken [[H3947]] to [[H413]] the palace [[H1004]] and placed under [[H413]] the care [[H3027]] of Hegai, [[H1896]] the custodian [[H8104]] of the women. [[H802]] 
9 And the young woman [[H5291]] pleased him [[H3190]] and obtained [[H5375]] his [[H6440]] favor, [[H2617]] so he quickly [[H926]] provided her [[H5414]] with beauty treatments [[H8562]] and the special diet. [[H4490]] He assigned [[H5414]] to her  seven [[H7651]] select [[H7200]] maidservants [[H5291]] from the palace [[H1004]] and transferred her [[H8138]] with them [[H5291]] to the best [[H2896]] place in the harem. [[H1004]] 
10 Esther [[H635]] did not [[H3808]] reveal [[H5046]] her people [[H5971]] or [[H853]] her lineage, [[H4138]] because [[H3588]] Mordecai [[H4782]] had instructed [[H6680]] her [[H5921]] not [[H3808]] to do so. [[H5046]] 
11 Every day [[H3605]] Mordecai [[H4782]] walked back and forth [[H1980]] in front [[H6440]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] of the harem [[H1004]] to learn [[H3045]] about [[H853]] Esther's [[H635]] welfare [[H7965]] and what [[H4100]] was happening [[H6213]] to her.  
12 In the twelve [[H8147]] months [[H2320]] before [her] [[H5291]] turn [[H8447]] to go [[H935]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Xerxes, [[H325]] the harem [[H802]] regulation required [[H1881]] [each young woman] [[H802]] to receive beauty treatments [[H4795]] with oil [[H8081]] of myrrh [[H4753]] for six [[H8337]] months, [[H2320]] and then with perfumes [[H1314]] and cosmetics [[H8562]] for another six [[H8337]] months. [[H2320]] 
13 When [[H2088]] the young woman [[H5291]] would go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] she was given [[H5414]] whatever [[H3605]] she requested [[H559]] to take [[H935]] with her [[H5973]] from the harem [[H1004]] to [[H5704]] the king's [[H4428]] palace. [[H1004]] 
14 She [[H1931]] would go [there] [[H935]] in the evening, [[H6153]] and in the morning [[H1242]] she [[H1931]] would return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] a second [[H8145]] harem [[H1004]] under [[H413]] the care [[H3027]] of Shaashgaz, [[H8190]] the king’s [[H4428]] eunuch [[H5631]] in charge of [[H8104]] the concubines. [[H6370]] She would not [[H3808]] return [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] unless [[H3588]] he [[H4428]] delighted [[H2654]] in her  and summoned her [[H7121]] by name. [[H8034]] 
15 Now Esther [[H635]] [was] the daughter [[H1323]] of Abihail, [[H32]] the uncle [[H1730]] from whom Mordecai [[H4782]] had adopted [[H3947]] her  as his own daughter. [[H1323]] And when it was her turn [[H8447]] to go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] she did not [[H3808]] ask for [[H1245]] anything [[H1697]] except [[H3588]] what [[H834]] Hegai, [[H1896]] the king’s [[H4428]] trusted official [[H5631]] in charge of [[H8104]] the harem, [[H802]] had advised. [[H559]] And Esther [[H635]] found [[H5375]] favor [[H2580]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of everyone [[H3605]] who saw her. [[H7200]] 
16 She [[H635]] was taken [[H3947]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] in [[H413]] the royal [[H4438]] palace [[H1004]] in the tenth [[H6224]] month, [[H2320]] the month [[H2320]] Tebeth, [[H2887]] in the seventh [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of his reign. [[H4438]] 
17 And the king [[H4428]] loved [[H157]] Esther [[H635]] more than all [[H3605]] the [other] women, [[H802]] and she found [[H5375]] grace [[H2580]] and favor [[H2617]] in his sight [[H6440]] more than all [[H3605]] of the other virgins. [[H1330]] So he placed [[H7760]] the royal [[H4438]] crown [[H3804]] upon her head [[H7218]] and made her queen [[H4427]] in place of [[H8478]] Vashti. [[H2060]] 
18 Then the king [[H4428]] held [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] banquet, [[H4960]] Esther’s [[H635]] banquet, [[H4960]] for all [[H3605]] his officials [[H8269]] and servants. [[H5650]] He proclaimed [[H6213]] a tax holiday [[H2010]] in the provinces [[H4082]] and gave [[H5414]] gifts [[H4864]] worthy of the king’s [[H4428]] bounty. [[H3027]] 
19 When the virgins [[H1330]] were assembled [[H6908]] a second [time], [[H8145]] Mordecai [[H4782]] was sitting [[H3427]] at the King’s [[H4428]] Gate. [[H8179]] 
20 Esther [[H635]] still had not [[H369]] revealed [[H5046]] her lineage [[H4138]] or her people, [[H5971]] just as [[H834]] Mordecai [[H4782]] had instructed. [[H6680]] She [[H635]] obeyed [[H6213]] Mordecai’s [[H4782]] command, [[H3982]] as [[H834]] she had done [[H1961]] under his care. [[H545]] 
21 In those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] while Mordecai [[H4782]] was sitting [[H3427]] at the King’s [[H4428]] Gate, [[H8179]] Bigthan [[H904]] and Teresh, [[H8657]] two [[H8147]] eunuchs [[H5631]] who guarded [[H8104]] the king’s [[H4428]] entrance, [[H5592]] grew angry [[H7107]] and conspired [[H1245]] to assassinate [[H7971]] King [[H4428]] Xerxes. [[H325]] 
22 When Mordecai [[H4782]] learned [[H3045]] of the plot, [[H1697]] he reported [[H5046]] it to Queen [[H4436]] Esther, [[H635]] and she [[H635]] informed [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] on Mordecai’s behalf. [[H4782]] 
23 After the report [[H1697]] had been investigated [[H1245]] and verified, [[H4672]] both [officials] [[H8147]] were hanged [[H8518]] on [[H5921]] the gallows. [[H6086]] And all this was recorded [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the king. [[H4428]]
