[[Esther 3|←]] • [[Esther 5|→]]
1 When Mordecai [[H4782]] learned of [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] had happened, [[H6213]] he [[H4782]] tore [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] put on [[H3847]] sackcloth [[H8242]] and ashes, [[H665]] and went out [[H3318]] into the middle [[H8432]] of the city, [[H5892]] wailing [[H2199]] loudly [[H1419]] and bitterly. [[H4751]] 
2 But he went only [[H935]] as [[H5704]] far as the King’s [[H4428]] Gate, [[H8179]] because [[H3588]] the law prohibited [[H369]] anyone wearing [[H3830]] sackcloth [[H8242]] from entering [[H935]] [that] [[H4428]] gate. [[H8179]] 
3 In every [[H3605]] province [[H4082]] to which [[H4725]] the king’s [[H4428]] command [[H1697]] and edict [[H1881]] came, [[H5060]] there was great [[H1419]] mourning [[H60]] among the Jews. [[H3064]] They fasted, [[H6685]] wept, [[H1065]] and lamented, [[H4553]] and many [[H7227]] lay [[H3331]] in sackcloth [[H8242]] and ashes. [[H665]] 
4 When  Esther's [[H635]] maidens [[H5291]] and eunuchs [[H5631]] came [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] her [about Mordecai],  the queen [[H4436]] was overcome with distress. [[H2342]] She sent [[H7971]] clothes [[H899]] for Mordecai [[H4782]] to wear [[H3847]] instead of [[H5493]] his sackcloth, [[H8242]] but he would not [[H3808]] accept them. [[H6901]] 
5 Then Esther [[H635]] summoned [[H7121]] Hathach, [[H2047]] one of the king’s [[H4428]] eunuchs [[H5631]] appointed [[H5975]] to her, [[H6440]] and she dispatched [[H6680]] him to [[H5921]] Mordecai [[H4782]] to learn [[H3045]] what was troubling him [[H4100]] and why. [[H5921]] 
6 So Hathach [[H2047]] went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] Mordecai [[H4782]] in [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] square [[H7339]] in front [[H6440]] of the King’s [[H4428]] Gate, [[H8179]] 
7 and Mordecai [[H4782]] told [[H5046]] him  all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] had happened to him, [[H7136]] including [[H853]] the exact amount [[H6575]] of money [[H3701]] that [[H834]] Haman [[H2001]] had promised [[H559]] to pay [[H8254]] into [[H5921]] the royal [[H4428]] treasury [[H1595]] in order to destroy [[H6]] the Jews. [[H3064]] 
8 Mordecai also gave [Hathach] [[H5414]] a copy [[H6572]] of the written [[H3791]] decree [[H1881]] issued [[H5414]] in Susa [[H7800]] for the destruction [of the Jews], [[H8045]] to show [[H7200]] and explain [[H5046]] to [[H853]] Esther, [[H635]] urging her [[H6680]] to approach [[H935]] the king, [[H4428]] implore his favor, [[H2603]] and plead [[H1245]] before him [[H6440]] for [[H5921]] her [[H5921]] people. [[H5971]] 
9 So Hathach [[H2047]] went back [[H935]] and relayed [[H5046]] Mordecai’s [[H4782]] response [[H1697]] to Esther. [[H635]] 
10 Then Esther [[H635]] spoke [[H559]] to Hathach [[H2047]] and instructed [[H6680]] him to [[H413]] tell Mordecai, [[H4782]] 
11 “All [[H3605]] the royal [[H4428]] officials [[H5650]] and the people [[H5971]] of the king's [[H4428]] provinces [[H4082]] know [[H3045]] that [[H834]] one [[H259]] law [[H1881]] applies to every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] or woman [[H802]] who [[H834]] approaches [[H935]] the king [[H4428]] in [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] courtyard [[H2691]] without [[H834]] being summoned [[H7121]] that he be put to death. [[H4191]] Only if [[H905]] the king [[H4428]] extends [[H3447]] the gold [[H2091]] scepter [[H8275]] may that person live. [[H2421]] But I [[H589]] have not [[H3808]] been summoned [[H7121]] to appear [[H935]] before [[H413]] the [[H2088]] king [[H4428]] for the past thirty [[H7970]] days. [[H3117]] 
12 When Esther's [[H635]] words [[H1697]] were relayed [[H5046]] to Mordecai, [[H4782]] 
13 he [[H4782]] sent back [[H559]] to [[H413]] [her] [[H635]] this reply: [[H7725]] “Do not [[H408]] imagine [[H1819]] that because you are [[H5315]] in the king's [[H4428]] palace [[H1004]] you alone will escape [[H4422]] the fate of all [[H3605]] the Jews. [[H3064]] 
14 For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you remain [[H2790]] silent [[H2790]] at this [[H2063]] time, [[H6256]] relief [[H7305]] and deliverance [[H2020]] for the Jews [[H3064]] will arise [[H5975]] from another [[H312]] place, [[H4725]] but you [[H859]] and your father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] will perish. [[H6]] And who [[H4310]] knows [[H3045]] but that [[H518]] you have come [[H5060]] to the kingdom [[H4438]] for such a time [[H6256]] as this? [[H2063]] 
15 Then Esther [[H635]] sent [[H7725]] this reply [[H559]] to [[H413]] Mordecai: [[H4782]] 
16 “Go [[H1980]] and assemble [[H3664]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] who can be found [[H4672]] in Susa, [[H7800]] and fast [[H6684]] for me. [[H5921]] Do not [[H408]] eat [[H398]] or drink [[H8354]] day [[H3117]] or night [[H3915]] for three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] and I [[H589]] and my maidens [[H5291]] will fast [[H6684]] as you do. [[H3651]] After that, [[H3651]] I will go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] even though [[H834]] it is against [[H3808]] the law, [[H1881]] and if [[H834]] I perish, [[H6]] I perish. [[H6]] 
17 So Mordecai [[H4782]] went [[H5674]] and did [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Esther [[H635]] had instructed [[H6680]] him. [[H5921]]
