[[Esther 7|←]] • [[Esther 9|→]]
1 That same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] awarded [[H5414]] Queen [[H4436]] Esther [[H635]] the estate [[H1004]] of Haman, [[H2001]] the enemy [[H6887]] of the Jews. [[H3064]] And Mordecai [[H4782]] entered [[H935]] the king’s [[H4428]] presence [[H6440]] because [[H3588]] Esther [[H635]] had revealed [[H5046]] his relation [[H1931]] to her.  
2 The king [[H4428]] removed [[H5493]] the signet ring [[H2885]] he had recovered [[H5674]] from Haman [[H2001]] and presented it [[H5414]] to Mordecai. [[H4782]] And Esther [[H635]] appointed [[H7760]] him [[H4782]] over [[H5921]] the estate [[H1004]] of Haman. [[H2001]] 
3 And once again, [[H3254]] Esther [[H635]] addressed [[H1696]] the king. [[H4428]] She fell [[H5307]] at [[H6440]] his feet [[H7272]] weeping [[H1058]] and begged [[H2603]] him to revoke [[H5674]] the evil [[H7451]] scheme [[H4284]] of Haman [[H2001]] the Agagite, [[H91]] which [[H834]] he had devised [[H2803]] against [[H5921]] the Jews. [[H3064]] 
4 The king [[H4428]] extended [[H3447]] the gold [[H2091]] scepter [[H8275]] toward Esther, [[H635]] and [she] [[H635]] arose [[H6965]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]] 
5 “If [[H518]] it pleases [[H5921]] the king,” [[H4428]] she said, [[H559]] “and if I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in his sight, [[H6440]] and the matter [[H1697]] [seems] proper [[H3787]] to the king, [[H4428]] and I [[H589]] am pleasing [[H2896]] in his sight, [[H5869]] may an order be written [[H3789]] to revoke [[H7725]] the letters [[H5612]] that the scheming [[H4284]] Haman [[H2001]] son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha, [[H4099]] the Agagite, [[H91]] wrote [[H3789]] to destroy [[H6]] the Jews [[H3064]] in all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] provinces. [[H4082]] 
6 For [[H3588]] how [[H349]] could I bear [[H3201]] to see [[H7200]] the disaster [[H7451]] that [[H834]] would befall [[H4672]] my people? [[H5971]] How [[H349]] could I bear [[H3201]] to see [[H7200]] the destruction [[H13]] of my kindred?” [[H4138]] 
7 So King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] said [[H559]] to Esther [[H635]] the Queen [[H4436]] and Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew, [[H3064]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I have given [[H5414]] Haman’s [[H2001]] estate [[H1004]] to Esther, [[H635]] and he was hanged [[H8518]] on [[H5921]] the gallows [[H6086]] because [[H5921]] he attacked [[H7971]] the Jews. [[H3064]] 
8 Now you [[H859]] may write [[H3789]] in the king’s [[H4428]] name [[H8034]] as [[H2896]] you please [[H5869]] regarding [[H5921]] the Jews, [[H3064]] and seal it [[H2856]] with the royal [[H4428]] signet ring. [[H2885]] For a decree [[H3791]] that [[H834]] is written [[H3789]] in the name [[H8034]] of the king [[H4428]] and sealed [[H2856]] with the royal [[H4428]] signet ring [[H2885]] cannot [[H369]] be revoked. [[H7725]] 
9 At once [[H6256]] the royal [[H4428]] scribes [[H5608]] were summoned, [[H7121]] and on the twenty-third [day] [[H7969]] of the third [[H7992]] month [[H2320]] ( [[H1931]] the month [[H2320]] of Sivan), [[H5510]] they recorded [[H3789]] all of [[H3605]] Mordecai's [[H4782]] orders [[H6680]] to [[H413]] the Jews [[H3064]] and to [[H413]] the satraps, [[H323]] governors, [[H6346]] and princes [[H8269]] of the 127 [[H7651]] provinces [[H4082]] from India [[H1912]] to [[H5704]] Cush [[H3568]] [writing] to each province [[H4082]] in its own script, [[H4082]] to every people [[H5971]] in their own language, [[H3956]] and to [[H413]] the Jews [[H3064]] in their own script [[H3789]] and language. [[H3956]] 
10 Mordecai wrote [[H3789]] in the name [[H8034]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] and sealed it [[H2856]] with the royal [[H4428]] signet ring. [[H2885]] He sent [[H7971]] the documents [[H5612]] by [[H3027]] mounted [[H5483]] couriers [[H7323]] riding on [[H7392]] swift horses [[H7409]] bred [[H1121]] from the royal [[H327]] mares. [[H7424]] 
11 By these letters [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] permitted [[H5414]] the Jews [[H3064]] in each [[H3605]] and every city [[H5892]] the right to assemble [[H6950]] and defend [[H5921]] themselves, [[H5315]] to destroy, [[H8045]] kill, [[H2026]] and annihilate [[H6]] all [[H3605]] the forces [[H2426]] of any people [[H5971]] or province [[H4082]] hostile to them, [[H6696]] including women [[H802]] and children, [[H2945]] and to plunder [[H7998]] their possessions. [[H962]] 
12 The single [[H259]] day [appointed] [[H3117]] throughout all [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] [was] the thirteenth [[H7969]] day of the twelfth [[H8147]] month, [[H2320]] the month [[H2320]] of Adar. [[H143]] 
13 A copy [[H6572]] of the text, [[H3791]] issued [[H5414]] as law [[H1881]] throughout every [[H3605]] province, [[H4082]] was distributed [[H1540]] to all [[H3605]] the peoples, [[H5971]] so that the Jews [[H3064]] would be [[H1961]] prepared [[H6259]] on that [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] to avenge themselves [[H5358]] on their enemies. [[H341]] 
14 The couriers [[H7323]] rode [[H7392]] out [[H3318]] in haste [[H926]] on their royal [[H327]] horses, [[H7409]] pressed on [[H1765]] by the command [[H1697]] of the king. [[H4428]] And the edict [[H1881]] was also issued [[H5414]] in the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa. [[H7800]] 
15 Mordecai [[H4782]] went out [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the king [[H4428]] arrayed [[H3830]] in royal [[H4438]] purple [[H8504]] and white, [[H2353]] with a large [[H1419]] gold [[H2091]] crown [[H5850]] and a purple [[H713]] robe [[H8509]] of fine linen. [[H948]] And the city [[H5892]] of Susa [[H7800]] shouted [[H6670]] and rejoiced. [[H8055]] 
16 For the Jews [[H3064]] it was a time of [[H1961]] light [[H219]] and gladness, [[H8057]] of joy [[H8342]] and honor. [[H3366]] 
17 In every [[H3605]] province [[H4082]] and every [[H3605]] city, [[H5892]] wherever [[H4725]] the king’s [[H4428]] edict [[H1697]] and decree [[H1881]] reached, [[H5060]] there was joy [[H8057]] and gladness [[H8342]] among the Jews, [[H3064]] with feasting [[H4960]] and celebrating. [[H3117]] And many [[H7227]] of the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] themselves became Jews, [[H3054]] because [[H3588]] the fear [[H6343]] of the Jews [[H3064]] had fallen [[H5307]] upon them. [[H5921]]
