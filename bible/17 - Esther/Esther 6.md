1 That [[H1931]] night, [[H3915]] sleep [[H8142]] escaped [[H5074]] the king; [[H4428]] so he ordered [[H559]] the book [[H5612]] of records, [[H2146]] the chronicles, [[H1697]] to be brought in [[H935]] and read [[H7121]] to [[H6440]] him. [[H4428]] 
2 And there it was found [[H4672]] recorded [[H3789]] that [[H834]] Mordecai [[H4782]] had exposed [[H5046]] Bigthana [[H904]] and Teresh, [[H8657]] two [[H8147]] of the eunuchs [[H5631]] who guarded [[H8104]] the king’s [[H4428]] entrance, [[H5592]] when [[H834]] they had conspired [[H1245]] to assassinate [[H7971]] King [[H4428]] Xerxes. [[H325]] 
3 The king [[H4428]] inquired, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] honor [[H3366]] or dignity [[H1420]] has been bestowed [[H6213]] on Mordecai [[H4782]] for [[H5921]] this act?” [[H2088]] “Nothing [[H3808]] has been done [[H6213]] for him,” [[H5973]] replied [[H559]] the king's [[H4428]] attendants. [[H5288]] 
4 “Who [[H4310]] is in the court?” [[H2691]] the king [[H4428]] asked. [[H559]] Now Haman [[H2001]] had [just] entered [[H935]] the outer [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] of the palace [[H1004]] to ask [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] to hang [[H8518]] Mordecai [[H4782]] on [[H5921]] the gallows [[H6086]] he had prepared [[H3559]] for him.  
5 So the king’s [[H4428]] attendants [[H5288]] answered him, [[H559]] “Haman [[H2001]] is there, [[H2009]] standing [[H5975]] in the court.” [[H2691]] “Bring him in,” [[H935]] ordered [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]] 
6 Haman [[H2001]] entered, [[H935]] and the king [[H4428]] asked [[H559]] him,  “What [[H4100]] should be done [[H6213]] for the man [[H376]] the king [[H4428]] wants [[H2654]] to honor?” [[H3366]] Now Haman [[H2001]] thought [[H559]] to himself, [[H3820]] “Who [[H4310]] would the king [[H4428]] be delighted [[H2654]] to honor [[H6213]] more [[H3148]] than me?” [[H4480]] 
7 And Haman [[H2001]] told [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] “For the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] is delighted [[H2654]] to honor, [[H3366]] 
8 have them bring [[H935]] a royal [[H4438]] robe [[H3830]] that [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] himself has worn, [[H3847]] and a horse [[H5483]] the king [[H4428]] himself has ridden, [[H7392]] with [[H834]] a royal [[H4438]] crest [[H3804]] on its head. [[H7218]] 
9 Let [[H5414]] the robe [[H3830]] and the horse [[H5483]] be entrusted [[H5921]] to one [[H376]] of the king’s [[H4428]] most noble [[H6579]] princes. [[H8269]] Let them array [[H3847]] the man [[H376]] the king [[H4428]] wants [[H2654]] to honor [[H3366]] and parade him [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] the horse [[H5483]] through the city [[H5892]] square, [[H7339]] proclaiming [[H7121]] before him, [[H6440]] This is what [[H3602]] is done [[H6213]] for the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] is delighted [[H2654]] to honor!’ [[H3366]] 
10 “Hurry,” [[H4116]] said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] to Haman, [[H2001]] “and do [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] you proposed. [[H1696]] Take [[H3947]] the robe [[H3830]] and [[H853]] the horse [[H5483]] to Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew, [[H3064]] who is sitting [[H3427]] at the King’s [[H4428]] Gate. [[H8179]] Do not [[H408]] neglect [[H5307]] anything [[H1697]] that [[H834]] you have suggested.” [[H1696]] 
11 So Haman [[H2001]] took [[H3947]] the robe [[H3830]] and the horse, [[H5483]] arrayed [[H3847]] Mordecai, [[H4782]] and paraded [[H7392]] him through the city [[H5892]] square, [[H7339]] crying out [[H7121]] before him, [[H6440]] “This is what [[H3602]] is done [[H6213]] for the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] is delighted [[H2654]] to honor!” [[H3366]] 
12 Then Mordecai [[H4782]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the King’s [[H4428]] Gate. [[H8179]] But Haman [[H2001]] rushed [[H1765]] home, [[H1004]] with his head [[H7218]] covered [[H2645]] in grief. [[H57]] 
13 Haman [[H2001]] told [[H5608]] his wife [[H802]] Zeresh [[H2238]] and all [[H3605]] his friends [[H157]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] had happened. [[H7136]] His advisers [[H2450]] and his wife [[H802]] Zeresh [[H2238]] said [[H559]] to him,  “Since [[H518]] Mordecai, [[H4782]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] your downfall [[H5307]] has begun, [[H2490]] is Jewish, [[H3064]] you will not prevail [[H3201]] against him  for [[H3588]] surely [[H5307]] you will fall [[H5307]] before him. [[H6440]] 
14 While they were still [[H5750]] speaking [[H1696]] with [Haman], [[H5973]] the king's [[H4428]] eunuchs [[H5631]] arrived [[H5060]] and rushed [[H926]] [him] [[H2001]] to [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] that [[H834]] Esther [[H635]] had prepared. [[H6213]]
