# James 1
[[Hebrews 13|←]] • [[James 2|→]]
1 James, [[G2385]] a servant [[G1401]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] To the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] tribes [[G5443]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Dispersion: [[G1290]] Greetings. [[G5463]] 
2 Consider [it] [[G2233]] pure [[G3956]] joy, [[G5479]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] when [[G3752]] you encounter [[G4045]] trials [[G3986]] of many kinds, [[G4164]] 
3 because you know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] testing [[G1383]] of your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] develops [[G2716]] perseverance. [[G5281]] 
4 Allow [[G2192]] perseverance [[G5281]] to finish [[G5046]] [its] work, [[G2041]] so that [[G2443]] you may be [[G1510]] mature [[G5046]] and [[G2532]] complete, [[G3648]] [not] lacking [[G3007]] [anything]. [[G3367]] 
5 If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] of you [[G4771]] lacks [[G3007]] wisdom, [[G4678]] he should ask [[G154]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] gives [[G1325]] generously [[G574]] to all [[G3956]] without [[G3361]] finding fault, [[G3679]] and [[G2532]] it will be given [[G1325]] to him. [[G846]] 
6 But [[G1161]] he must ask [[G154]] in [[G1722]] faith, [[G4102]] without [[G3367]] doubting, [[G1252]] because [[G1063]] he who [[G3588]] doubts [[G1252]] is like [[G1503]] a wave [[G2830]] of [the] sea, [[G2281]] blown [[G416]] and [[G2532]] tossed by the wind. [[G4494]] 
7 That [[G1565]] man [[G444]] {should} not [[G3361]] expect [[G3633]] to receive [[G2983]] anything [[G5100]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
8 [He is] a double-minded [[G1374]] man, [[G435]] unstable [[G182]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] ways. [[G3598]] 
9 The [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] in humble circumstances [[G5011]] should exult [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] high position. [[G5311]] 
10 But [[G1161]] the [one who is] [[G3588]] rich [[G4145]] [should exult] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] low position, [[G5014]] because [[G3754]] he will pass away [[G3928]] like [[G5613]] a flower [[G438]] of the field. [[G5528]] 
11 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] rises [[G393]] with [[G4862]] scorching heat [[G2742]] and [[G2532]] withers [[G3583]] the [[G3588]] plant; [[G5528]] its [[G846]] flower [[G438]] falls [[G1601]] and [[G2532]] [its] [[G3588]] beauty [[G2143]] is lost. [[G622]] So [[G3779]] too, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rich [man] [[G4145]] will fade away [[G3133]] in the midst of [[G1722]] his [[G846]] pursuits. [[G4197]] 
12 Blessed [is the] [[G3107]] man [[G435]] who [[G3739]] perseveres [[G5278]] under trial, [[G3986]] because [[G3754]] when he has [[G1096]] stood the test, [[G1384]] he will receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] crown [[G4735]] of life [[G2222]] that [[G3739]] [God] has promised [[G1861]] to those who [[G3588]] love [[G25]] Him. [[G846]] 
13 When tempted, [[G3985]] no one [[G3367]] should say, [[G3004]] “God [[G2316]] is tempting me.” [[G3985]] For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] cannot be tempted [[G551]] by evil, [[G2556]] [nor] [[G1161]] does He tempt [[G3985]] [anyone]. [[G3762]] 
14 But [[G1161]] each one [[G1538]] is tempted [[G3985]] [when] by [[G5259]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] evil desires [[G1939]] he is lured away [[G1828]] and [[G2532]] enticed. [[G1185]] 
15 Then [[G1534]] [after] desire [[G1939]] has conceived, [[G4815]] it gives birth to [[G5088]] sin; [[G266]] and [[G1161]] sin, [[G266]] when it is fully grown, [[G658]] gives birth to [[G616]] death. [[G2288]] 
16 {Do} not [[G3361]] be deceived, [[G4105]] my [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] brothers. [[G80]] 
17 Every [[G3956]] good [[G1394]] and [[G2532]] perfect [[G5046]] gift [[G1434]] is [[G1510]] from above, [[G509]] coming down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] of the heavenly lights, [[G5457]] with [[G3844]] whom [[G3739]] there is [[G1762]] no [[G3756]] change [[G3883]] or [[G2228]] shifting [[G5157]] shadow. [[G644]] 
18 He chose [[G1014]] to give us birth [[G616]] through [the] word [[G3056]] of truth, [[G225]] that [[G1519]] we [[G1473]] would be [[G1510]] a kind of [[G5100]] firstfruits [[G536]] of His [[G846]] creation. [[G2938]] 
19 My [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] brothers, [[G80]] understand this: [[G1492]] Everyone [[G3956]] should be [[G1510]] quick [[G5036]] to [[G1519]] listen, [[G191]] slow [[G1021]] to [[G1519]] speak, [[G2980]] [and] slow [[G1021]] to [[G1519]] anger, [[G3709]] 
20 for [[G1063]] man’s [[G435]] anger [[G3709]] {does} not [[G3756]] bring about [[G2038]] [the] righteousness [[G1343]] that God [desires]. [[G2316]] 
21 Therefore, [[G1352]] get rid [[G659]] of all [[G3956]] moral filth [[G4507]] and [[G2532]] [every] expression [[G4050]] of evil, [[G2549]] [and] humbly [[G4240]] receive [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] planted [in you], [[G1721]] which [[G3588]] can [[G1410]] save [[G4982]] your [[G4771]] souls. [[G5590]] 
22 Be [[G1096]] doers [[G4163]] of [the] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] hearers [[G202]] only. [[G3440]] [Otherwise,] you are deceiving [[G3884]] yourselves. [[G1438]] 
23 For [[G3754]] anyone [[G5100]] who hears [[G202]] [the] word [[G3056]] but [[G2532]] does not carry it out [[G4163]] is like [[G1503]] a man [who] [[G435]] looks [[G2657]] at his [[G846]] face [[G4383]] in [[G1722]] a mirror, [[G2072]] 
24 [and] [[G1063]] after observing [[G2657]] himself [[G1438]] goes away [[G565]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] forgets [[G1950]] what he [looks] like. [[G1510]] 
25 But [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] looks intently [[G3879]] into [[G1519]] [the] perfect [[G5046]] law [[G3551]] of freedom, [[G1657]] and [[G2532]] continues to do so— [[G3887]] not [[G3756]] being [[G1096]] a forgetful [[G1953]] hearer, [[G202]] but [[G235]] an effective [[G2041]] doer— [[G4163]] [he] [[G3778]] will be [[G1510]] blessed [[G3107]] in [[G1722]] what [[G3588]] he [[G846]] does. [[G4162]] 
26 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] considers himself [[G1380]] religious [[G2357]] [and yet] does not bridle [[G5468]] his [[G846]] tongue, [[G1100]] he deceives [[G538]] his [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] [and his] [[G3778]] religion [[G2356]] [is] worthless. [[G3152]] 
27 Pure [[G2513]] and [[G2532]] undefiled [[G283]] religion [[G2356]] before [[G3844]] [our] [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] this: [[G3778]] to care for [[G1980]] orphans [[G3737]] and [[G2532]] widows [[G5503]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] distress, [[G2347]] [and] to keep [[G5083]] oneself [[G1438]] from being polluted [[G784]] by [[G575]] the [[G3588]] world.
