1 Not [[G3361]] many [of you] [[G4183]] should become [[G1096]] teachers, [[G1320]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] [because] you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we [ who teach ] will be [[G2983]] judged [[G2917]] more strictly. [[G3173]] 
2 We all stumble [[G4417]] in many ways. [[G4183]] If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] {is} never [[G3756]] at fault [[G4417]] in [[G1722]] what he says, [[G3056]] he [is] [[G3778]] a perfect [[G5046]] man, [[G435]] able [[G1415]] to control [[G5468]] [his] [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] body. [[G4983]] 
3 [When] [[G1487]] we put [[G906]] bits [[G5469]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mouths [[G4750]] of the [[G3588]] horses [[G2462]] to make [[G1519]] them [[G846]] obey [[G3982]] us, [[G1473]] we can guide [[G3329]] the [[G846]] whole [[G3650]] animal. [[G4983]] 
4 Consider [[G2400]] ships [[G4143]] as well. [[G2532]] Although they are [[G1510]] so large [[G5082]] and [[G2532]] are driven [[G1643]] by [[G5259]] strong [[G4642]] winds, [[G417]] they are steered [[G3329]] by [[G5259]] a very small [[G1646]] rudder [[G4079]] wherever [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] pilot [[G2116]] is inclined. [[G3730]] 
5 In the same way, [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] tongue [[G1100]] is [[G1510]] a small [[G3398]] part of the body, [[G3196]] [but] [[G2532]] it boasts of [[G3166]] great things. [[G3173]] Consider [[G2400]] how small [[G2245]] a spark [[G4442]] sets [[G381]] a great [[G2245]] forest {ablaze}. [[G5208]] 
6 The [[G3588]] tongue [[G1100]] also [[G2532]] [is] a fire, [[G4442]] a [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] of wickedness [[G93]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] parts [[G3196]] of the [body]. [[G1473]] It pollutes [[G4695]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] person, [[G4983]] sets [[G5394]] the [[G3588]] course [[G5164]] of his life {on fire}, [[G1078]] and [[G2532]] is itself set on fire [[G5394]] by [[G5259]] hell. [[G1067]] 
7 All [[G3956]] kinds [[G5449]] of animals, [[G2342]] birds, [[G4071]] reptiles, [[G2062]] and [[G2532]] creatures of the sea [[G1724]] are being tamed [[G1150]] and [[G2532]] have been tamed [[G1150]] by [[G3588]] man, [[G442]] 
8 but [[G1161]] no [[G3762]] man [[G444]] can [[G1410]] tame [[G1150]] the [[G3588]] tongue. [[G1100]] [It is] a restless [[G182]] evil, [[G2556]] full [[G3324]] of deadly [[G2287]] poison. [[G2447]] 
9 With [[G1722]] [the tongue] [[G846]] we bless [[G2127]] our [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] it [[G846]] we curse [[G2672]] men, [[G444]] who [[G3588]] have been made [[G1096]] in [[G2596]] God’s [[G2316]] likeness. [[G3669]] 
10 Out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] come [[G1831]] blessing [[G2129]] and [[G2532]] cursing. [[G2671]] My [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] this [[G3778]] should [[G5534]] not [[G3756]] be! [[G1096]] 
11 [Can] [[G3385]] [both] fresh [water] [[G1099]] and [[G2532]] bitter [water] [[G4089]] flow [[G1032]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] spring? [[G4077]] 
12 My [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] can [[G1410]] a fig tree [[G4808]] grow [[G4160]] olives, [[G1636]] or [[G2228]] a grapevine [[G288]] [bear] figs? [[G4810]] Neither [can] [[G3777]] a salt [spring] [[G252]] produce [[G4160]] fresh [[G1099]] water. [[G5204]] 
13 Who [[G5101]] [is] wise [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] understanding [[G1990]] among [[G1722]] you? [[G4771]] Let him show it [[G1166]] by [[G1537]] [his] [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] conduct, [[G391]] [by] [[G846]] deeds [done] [[G2041]] in [[G1722]] [the] humility [[G4240]] that comes from wisdom. [[G4678]] 
14 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you {harbor} [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] bitter [[G4089]] jealousy [[G2205]] and [[G2532]] selfish ambition, [[G2052]] {do} not [[G3361]] boast [in it] [[G2620]] or [[G2532]] deny [[G5574]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] 
15 Such [[G3778]] wisdom [[G4678]] [does] [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] come [[G2718]] from above, [[G509]] but [[G235]] [is] earthly, [[G1919]] unspiritual, [[G5591]] demonic. [[G1141]] 
16 For [[G1063]] where [[G3699]] jealousy [[G2205]] and [[G2532]] selfish ambition [exist], [[G2052]] there [ will be ] [[G1563]] disorder [[G181]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] evil [[G5337]] practice. [[G4229]] 
17 But [[G1161]] [the] wisdom [[G4678]] from above [[G509]] is [[G1510]] first [[G4412]] [of all] [[G3303]] pure, [[G53]] then [[G1899]] peaceable, [[G1516]] gentle, [[G1933]] accommodating, [[G2138]] full [[G3324]] of mercy [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] good [[G18]] fruit, [[G2590]] impartial, [[G87]] [and] sincere. [[G505]] 
18 Peacemakers [[G1515]] [who] sow [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] peace [ reap ] [[G1515]] [the] fruit [[G2590]] of righteousness. [[G1343]]
