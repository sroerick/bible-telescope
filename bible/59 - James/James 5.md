1 Come [[G71]] now, [[G3568]] [you who are] [[G3588]] rich, [[G4145]] weep [[G2799]] [and] wail [[G3649]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] misery [[G5004]] to come [[G1904]] upon you. [[G4771]] 
2 Your [[G4771]] riches [[G4149]] have rotted [[G4595]] and [[G2532]] moths have eaten [[G4598]] your [[G4771]] clothes. [[G2440]] 
3 Your [[G4771]] gold [[G5557]] and [[G2532]] silver [[G696]] are corroded. [[G2728]] Their [[G846]] corrosion [[G2447]] will [[G1510]] testify [[G3142]] against you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] consume [[G5315]] your [[G4771]] flesh [[G4561]] like [[G5613]] fire. [[G4442]] You have hoarded treasure [[G2343]] in [[G1722]] [the] last [[G2078]] days. [[G2250]] 
4 Look, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] wages [[G3408]] you withheld [[G650]] from the [[G3588]] workmen [[G2040]] who [[G3588]] mowed [[G270]] your [[G4771]] fields [[G5561]] are crying out [[G2896]] against [[G575]] you. [[G4771]] The [[G3588]] cries [[G995]] of the [[G3588]] harvesters [[G2325]] have reached [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] ears [[G3775]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] of Hosts. [[G4519]] 
5 {You have lived} on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] in luxury [[G5171]] and [[G2532]] self-indulgence. [[G4684]] You have fattened [[G5142]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] in [[G1722]] [the] day [[G2250]] of slaughter. [[G4967]] 
6 You have condemned [[G2613]] [and] murdered [[G5407]] the [[G3588]] righteous, [[G1342]] who did not resist [[G498]] you. [[G4771]] 
7 Be patient, [[G3114]] then, [[G3767]] brothers, [[G80]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] coming. [[G3952]] See how [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] farmer [[G1092]] awaits [[G1551]] the [[G3588]] precious [[G5093]] fruit [[G2590]] of the [[G3588]] soil— [[G1093]] how patient he is [[G3114]] for [[G1909]] [the fall] [[G4406]] and [[G2532]] [spring rains]. [[G3797]] 
8 You [[G4771]] too, [[G2532]] be patient [[G3114]] [and] strengthen [[G4741]] your [[G4771]] hearts, [[G2588]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] coming [[G3952]] is near. [[G1448]] 
9 {Do} not [[G3361]] complain [[G4727]] about [[G2596]] one another, [[G240]] brothers, [[G80]] so that [[G2443]] you will not be judged. [[G2919]] Look, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] Judge [[G2923]] is standing [[G2476]] at [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] door! [[G2374]] 
10 Brothers, [[G80]] [as] an example [[G5262]] of patience [[G3115]] in affliction, [[G2552]] take [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] who [[G3739]] spoke [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
11 See how [[G2400]] blessed we consider [[G3106]] those who [[G3588]] have persevered. [[G5278]] You have heard [[G191]] of Job’s [[G2492]] perseverance [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] have seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] outcome [[G5056]] from [the] Lord. [[G2962]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G1510]] full of compassion [[G4184]] and [[G2532]] mercy. [[G3629]] 
12 Above [[G4253]] all, [[G3956]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] {do} not [[G3361]] swear, [[G3660]] not [by] [[G3383]] heaven [[G3772]] [or] [[G3383]] earth [[G1093]] [or by] [[G3383]] any [[G5100]] other [[G243]] oath. [[G3727]] Simply [[G1161]] {let} your [[G4771]] “Yes” [[G3483]] be [[G1510]] yes, [[G3483]] and [[G2532]] [your] [[G3588]] “No,” [[G3756]] no, [[G3756]] so that [[G2443]] you will not fall [[G4098]] under [[G5259]] judgment. [[G2920]] 
13 {Is} any one [[G5100]] of [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] suffering? [[G2553]] He should pray. [[G4336]] {Is} anyone [[G5100]] cheerful? [[G2114]] He should sing praises. [[G5567]] 
14 {Is} any one [[G5100]] of [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] sick? [[G770]] He should call [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] of the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] to pray [[G4336]] over [[G1909]] him [[G846]] and anoint [[G218]] him [[G846]] with oil [[G1637]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
15 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prayer offered [[G2171]] in faith [[G4102]] will restore [[G4982]] the one who [[G3588]] is sick. [[G2577]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] will raise him up. [[G1453]] If [[G2579]] he [[G1510]] has sinned, [[G4160]] he will be forgiven. [[G863]] 
16 Therefore [[G3767]] confess [[G1843]] [your] [[G3588]] sins [[G266]] to each other [[G240]] and [[G2532]] pray [[G2172]] for [[G5228]] each other [[G240]] so that [[G3704]] you may be healed. [[G2390]] [The] prayer [[G1162]] of a righteous [man] [[G1342]] has great power [[G1754]] to prevail. [[G2480]] 
17 Elijah [[G2243]] was [[G1510]] a man [[G444]] just like [[G3663]] us. [[G1473]] He prayed earnestly [[G4335]] [that it would] not [[G3361]] rain, [[G1026]] and [[G2532]] it did not rain [[G1026]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] for three [[G5140]] and [[G2532]] [a half] [[G1803]] years. [[G1763]] 
18 Again [[G3825]] he prayed, [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] gave [[G1325]] rain, [[G5205]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] yielded [[G985]] its [[G846]] crops. [[G2590]] 
19 My [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] if [[G1437]] one [[G5100]] of [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] should wander [[G4105]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] and [[G2532]] someone [[G5100]] should bring him back, [[G1994]] 
20 consider [[G1097]] this: [[G3754]] Whoever [[G3588]] turns [[G1994]] a sinner [[G268]] from [[G1537]] [the] error [[G4106]] of his [[G846]] way [[G3598]] will save [[G4982]] his [[G846]] soul [[G5590]] from [[G1537]] death [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] cover over [[G2572]] a multitude [[G4128]] of sins. [[G266]]
