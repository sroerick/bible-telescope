# Micah 2
[[Micah 1|←]] • [[Micah 3|→]]
1 Woe [[H1945]] to those who devise [[H2803]] iniquity [[H205]] and plot [[H6466]] evil [[H7451]] on [[H5921]] their beds! [[H4904]] At morning's [[H1242]] light [[H216]] they accomplish it [[H6213]] because [[H3588]] the power [[H410]] is [[H3426]] in their hands. [[H3027]] 
2 They covet [[H2530]] fields [[H7704]] and seize them, [[H1497]] and they take away [[H5375]] houses. [[H1004]] They deprive [[H6231]] a man [[H1397]] of his home, [[H1004]] a fellow man [[H376]] of his inheritance. [[H5159]] 
3 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “I am planning [[H2803]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] nation [[H4940]] a disaster [[H7451]] from [[H8033]] which [[H834]] you cannot [[H3808]] free [[H4185]] your necks. [[H6677]] Then you will not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] so proudly, [[H7317]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] will be a time [[H6256]] of calamity. [[H7451]] 
4 In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they will take up [[H5375]] a taunt [[H4912]] against you [[H5921]] and wail [[H5091]] this bitter [[H1961]] lamentation: [[H5092]] ‘We are utterly ruined; [[H7703]] He has changed [[H4171]] the portion [[H2506]] of my people! [[H5971]] How [[H349]] He has removed [it] [[H4185]] from me;  He has allotted [[H2505]] our fields [[H7704]] to traitors!’” [[H7728]] 
5 Therefore, [[H3651]] you will have [[H1961]] no one [[H3808]] in the assembly [[H6951]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to divide [[H7993]] the land [[H2256]] by lot. [[H1486]] 
6 “Do not [[H408]] preach,” [[H5197]] they preach. [[H5197]] “Do not [[H3808]] preach [[H5197]] these things; [[H428]] disgrace [[H3639]] will not [[H3808]] overtake us.” [[H5253]] 
7 Should it be said, [[H559]] O house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] “Is the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] impatient? [[H7114]] Are these [[H428]] the things He does?” [[H4611]] Do not [[H3808]] My words [[H1697]] bring good [[H3190]] to [[H5973]] him who walks [[H1980]] uprightly? [[H3477]] 
8 But of late [[H865]] My people [[H5971]] have risen up [[H6965]] like an enemy: [[H341]] You strip off [[H6584]] the splendid [[H145]] robe [[H8008]] from unsuspecting [[H983]] passers-by [[H5674]] like men returning [[H7725]] from battle. [[H4421]] 
9 You drive [[H1644]] the women [[H802]] of My people [[H5971]] from their pleasant [[H8588]] homes. [[H1004]] You take away [[H3947]] My blessing [[H1926]] from [[H5921]] their children [[H5768]] forever. [[H5769]] 
10 Arise [[H6965]] and depart, [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] is not [[H3808]] your place of rest, [[H4496]] because [[H5668]] its defilement [[H2930]] brings destruction— [[H2254]] a grievous [[H4834]] destruction! [[H2256]] 
11 If [[H3863]] a man [[H376]] of wind [[H7307]] were to come [[H1980]] and say [[H3576]] falsely, [[H8267]] “I will preach [[H5197]] to you  of wine [[H3196]] and strong drink,” [[H7941]] he would be [[H1961]] just the preacher [[H5197]] for this [[H2088]] people! [[H5971]] 
12 I will surely [[H622]] gather [[H622]] all of you, [[H3605]] O Jacob; [[H3290]] I will collect [[H6908]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel. [[H3478]] I will bring [[H7760]] them together [[H3162]] like sheep [[H6629]] in a pen, [[H1223]] like a flock [[H5739]] in the midst [[H8432]] of its pasture— [[H1699]] a noisy [[H1949]] throng. [[H120]] 
13 One who breaks open the way [[H6555]] will go up [[H5927]] before them; [[H6440]] they will break [[H6555]] through [[H5674]] the gate, [[H8179]] and go out [[H3318]] by it.  Their king [[H4428]] will pass through [[H5674]] before them, [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] as their leader. [[H7218]]
