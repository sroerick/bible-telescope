# Micah 4
[[Micah 3|←]] • [[Micah 5|→]]
1 In the last [[H319]] days [[H3117]] the mountain [[H2022]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] as the chief [[H7218]] of the mountains; [[H2022]] it will be raised [[H5375]] above [[H1931]] the hills, [[H1389]] and the peoples [[H5971]] will stream [[H5102]] to it. [[H5921]] 
2 And many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] will come [[H1980]] and say, [[H559]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the mountain [[H2022]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] He will teach us [[H3384]] His ways, [[H1870]] so that we may walk [[H1980]] in His paths.” [[H734]] For [[H3588]] the law [[H8451]] will go forth [[H3318]] from Zion [[H6726]] and the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3069]] from Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
3 Then He will judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] and arbitrate [[H3198]] for strong [[H6099]] nations [[H1471]] far and wide. [[H7350]] Then they will beat [[H3807]] their swords [[H2719]] into plowshares [[H855]] and their spears [[H2595]] into pruning hooks. [[H4211]] Nation [[H1471]] will no longer [[H3808]] take up [[H5375]] the sword [[H2719]] against [[H413]] nation, [[H1471]] nor [[H3808]] will they train [[H3925]] anymore [[H5750]] for war. [[H4421]] 
4 And each man [[H376]] will sit [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] his own vine [[H1612]] [and] under [[H8478]] his own fig tree, [[H8384]] with no [[H369]] one to frighten him. [[H2729]] For [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has spoken. [[H1696]] 
5 Though [[H3588]] each [[H376]] of the peoples [[H5971]] may walk [[H1980]] in the name [[H8034]] of his god, [[H430]] yet we [[H587]] will walk [[H1980]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]] 
6 “On that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “I will gather [[H622]] the lame; [[H6760]] I will assemble [[H6908]] the outcast, [[H5080]] even those whom [[H834]] I have afflicted. [[H7489]] 
7 And I will make [[H7760]] the lame [[H6760]] into a remnant, [[H7611]] and the outcast [[H1972]] into a strong [[H6099]] nation. [[H1471]] Then the LORD [[H3068]] will rule [[H4427]] over them [[H5921]] in Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] from that day [[H6258]] and forever. [[H5704]] 
8 And you, [[H859]] O watchtower [[H4026]] of the flock, [[H5739]] O Stronghold [[H6076]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion— [[H6726]] the former [[H7223]] dominion [[H4475]] will be restored [[H857]] to you; [[H5704]] sovereignty [[H4467]] will come [[H935]] to the Daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
9 Why [[H4100]] do you now [[H6258]] cry [[H7321]] aloud? [[H7452]] Is there no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] among you?  Has [[H518]] your counselor [[H3289]] perished [[H6]] so that [[H3588]] anguish [[H2427]] grips you [[H2388]] like a woman in labor? [[H3205]] 
10 Writhe [[H2342]] in agony, [[H1518]] O Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] like a woman in labor. [[H3205]] For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] you will leave [[H3318]] the city [[H7151]] and camp [[H7931]] in the open fields. [[H7704]] You will go [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Babylon; [[H894]] there [[H8033]] you will be rescued; [[H5337]] there [[H8033]] the LORD [[H3068]] will redeem you [[H1350]] from the hand [[H3709]] of your enemies! [[H341]] 
11 But now [[H6258]] many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] have assembled [[H622]] against you, [[H5921]] saying, [[H559]] “Let her be defiled, [[H2610]] and let us feast our eyes [[H5869]] on Zion.” [[H6726]] 
12 But they [[H1992]] do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] the thoughts [[H4284]] of the LORD [[H3068]] or [[H3808]] understand [[H995]] His plan: [[H6098]] that [[H3588]] He has gathered them [[H6908]] like sheaves [[H5995]] to the threshing floor. [[H1637]] 
13 Rise [[H6965]] and thresh, [[H1758]] O Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] I will give you [[H7760]] horns [[H7161]] of iron [[H1270]] and hooves [[H6541]] of bronze [[H5154]] to break to pieces [[H1854]] many [[H7227]] peoples. [[H5971]] Then you will devote their gain [[H1214]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] their wealth [[H2428]] to the Lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]
