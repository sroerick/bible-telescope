1 Now, [[H6258]] O daughter [[H1323]] of troops, [[H1416]] marshal your troops; [[H1413]] for a siege [[H4692]] is laid [[H7760]] against us! [[H5921]] With a rod [[H7626]] they will strike [[H5221]] on [[H5921]] the cheek [[H3895]] the judge [[H8199]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
2 But you, [[H859]] Bethlehem [[H1035]] Ephrathah, [[H672]] who are [[H1961]] small [[H6810]] among the clans [[H505]] of Judah, [[H3063]] out of you [[H4480]] will come forth [[H3318]] for Me  One to be [[H1961]] ruler [[H4910]] over Israel, [[H3478]] whose origins [[H4163]] are of old, [[H6924]] from the days [[H3117]] of eternity. [[H5769]] 
3 Therefore [[H3651]] [Israel] will be abandoned [[H5414]] until [[H5704]] she who is in labor [[H3205]] has given birth; [[H3205]] then the rest [[H3499]] of His brothers [[H251]] will return [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
4 He will stand [[H5975]] and shepherd [His flock] [[H7462]] in the strength [[H5797]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] in the majestic [[H1347]] name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3069]] His God. [[H430]] And they will dwell securely, [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] then [[H6258]] His greatness will extend [[H1431]] to [[H5704]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
5 And He [[H2088]] will be [[H1961]] their peace. [[H7965]] When [[H3588]] Assyria [[H804]] invades [[H935]] our land [[H776]] and [[H3588]] tramples [[H1869]] our citadels, [[H759]] we will raise [[H6965]] against it [[H5921]] seven [[H7651]] shepherds, [[H7462]] even eight [[H8083]] leaders [[H5257]] of men. [[H120]] 
6 And they will rule [[H7489]] the land [[H776]] of Assyria [[H804]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and [[H853]] the land [[H776]] of Nimrod [[H5248]] with the blade drawn. [[H6607]] So He will deliver us [[H5337]] when [[H3588]] Assyria [[H804]] invades [[H935]] our land, [[H776]] and [[H3588]] tramples [[H1869]] our citadels. [[H1366]] 
7 Then the remnant [[H7611]] of Jacob [[H3290]] will be [[H1961]] in the midst [[H7130]] of many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] like dew [[H2919]] from [[H853]] the LORD, [[H3068]] like showers [[H7241]] on [[H5921]] the grass, [[H6212]] which [[H834]] do not [[H3808]] wait [[H6960]] for man [[H376]] or [[H3808]] linger [[H3176]] for mankind. [[H1121]] 
8 Then the remnant [[H7611]] of Jacob [[H3290]] will be [[H1961]] among the nations, [[H1471]] in the midst [[H7130]] of many [[H7227]] peoples, [[H5971]] like a lion [[H738]] among the beasts [[H929]] of the forest, [[H3293]] like a young lion [[H3715]] among flocks [[H5739]] of sheep, [[H6629]] which [[H834]] tramples [[H7429]] and tears [[H2963]] as [[H518]] it passes through, [[H5674]] with no [[H369]] one to rescue them. [[H5337]] 
9 Your hand [[H3027]] will be lifted [[H7311]] over [[H5921]] your foes, [[H6862]] and all [[H3605]] your enemies [[H341]] will be cut off. [[H3772]] 
10 “In that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “I will remove [[H3772]] your horses [[H5483]] from among you [[H7130]] and wreck [[H6]] your chariots. [[H4818]] 
11 I will remove [[H3772]] the cities [[H5892]] of your land [[H776]] and tear down [[H2040]] all [[H3605]] your strongholds. [[H4013]] 
12 I will cut [[H3772]] the sorceries [[H3785]] from your hand, [[H3027]] and you will have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] fortune-tellers. [[H6049]] 
13 I will also cut off [[H3772]] the carved images [[H6456]] and sacred pillars [[H4676]] from among you, [[H7130]] so that you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] bow down [[H7812]] to the work [[H4639]] of your own hands. [[H3027]] 
14 I will root out [[H5428]] the Asherah poles [[H842]] from your midst [[H7130]] and demolish [[H8045]] your cities. [[H5892]] 
15 I will take [[H6213]] vengeance [[H5359]] in anger [[H639]] and wrath [[H2534]] upon the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] obeyed Me.” [[H8085]]
