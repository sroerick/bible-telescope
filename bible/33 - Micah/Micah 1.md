# Micah 1
[[Jonah 4|←]] • [[Micah 2|→]]
1 [This is] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Micah [[H4318]] the Moreshite [[H4183]] in the days [[H3117]] of Jotham, [[H3147]] Ahaz, [[H271]] and Hezekiah, [[H2396]] kings [[H4428]] of Judah— [[H3063]] what [[H834]] he saw [[H2372]] regarding [[H5921]] Samaria [[H8111]] and Jerusalem: [[H3389]] 
2 Hear, [[H8085]] O peoples, [[H5971]] all of you; [[H3605]] listen, [[H7181]] O earth, [[H776]] and everyone in it! [[H4393]] The Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] will [[H1961]] witness [[H5707]] against you,  the Lord [[H136]] from His holy [[H6944]] temple. [[H1964]] 
3 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] comes forth [[H3318]] out of His dwelling place; [[H4725]] He will come down [[H3381]] and tread [[H1869]] on [[H5921]] the high places [[H1116]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
4 The mountains [[H2022]] will melt [[H4549]] beneath Him, [[H8478]] and the valleys [[H6010]] will split apart, [[H1234]] like wax [[H1749]] before [[H6440]] the fire, [[H784]] like water [[H4325]] cascading down [[H5064]] a slope. [[H4174]] 
5 All [[H3605]] this [is] [[H2063]] for the transgression [[H6588]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and the sins [[H2403]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] What [[H4310]] [is] the transgression [[H6588]] of Jacob? [[H3290]] Is it not [[H3808]] Samaria? [[H8111]] And what [[H4310]] is the high place [[H1116]] of Judah? [[H3063]] Is it not [[H3808]] Jerusalem? [[H3389]] 
6 Therefore I will make [[H7760]] Samaria [[H8111]] a heap of rubble [[H5856]] in the open field, [[H7704]] a planting area [[H4302]] for a vineyard. [[H3754]] I will pour [[H5064]] her stones [[H68]] into the valley [[H1516]] and expose [[H1540]] her foundations. [[H3247]] 
7 All [[H3605]] her carved images [[H6456]] will be smashed to pieces; [[H3807]] all [[H3605]] her wages [[H868]] will be burned [[H8313]] in the fire, [[H784]] and I will destroy [[H7760]] all [[H3605]] her idols. [[H6091]] Since [[H3588]] she collected [[H6908]] the wages [[H868]] of a prostitute, [[H2181]] they [[H868]] will be used again [[H7725]] on a prostitute. [[H2181]] 
8 Because of [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] I will lament [[H5594]] and wail; [[H3213]] I will walk [[H1980]] barefoot [[H7758]] and naked. [[H6174]] I will howl [[H6213]] like a jackal [[H8577]] and mourn [[H60]] like [[H1323]] an ostrich. [[H3284]] 
9 For [[H3588]] her wound [[H4347]] is incurable; [[H605]] it has reached [[H935]] even Judah; [[H3063]] it has approached [[H5060]] the gate [[H8179]] of my people, [[H5971]] as far as [[H5704]] Jerusalem itself. [[H3389]] 
10 Do not [[H408]] tell it [[H5046]] in Gath; [[H1661]] do not weep [[H1058]] at all. [[H1058]] Roll [[H6428]] in the dust [[H6083]] in Beth-leaphrah. [[H1036]] 
11 Depart [[H5674]] in shameful [[H1322]] nakedness, [[H6181]] O residents [[H3427]] of Shaphir. [[H8208]] The inhabitants [[H3427]] of Zaanan [[H6630]] will not [[H3808]] come out. [[H3318]] Beth-ezel [[H1018]] is in mourning; [[H5594]] its support [[H5979]] is taken [[H3947]] from you. [[H4480]] 
12 For [[H3588]] the residents [[H3427]] of Maroth [[H4796]] pined [[H2470]] for good, [[H2896]] but [[H3588]] calamity [[H7451]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H853]] the LORD, [[H3069]] even to the gate [[H8179]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
13 Harness [[H7573]] the horses [[H7409]] to the chariot, [[H4818]] O inhabitant [[H3427]] of Lachish. [[H3923]] You were [[H1931]] the beginning [[H7225]] of sin [[H2403]] to the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] the transgressions [[H6588]] of Israel [[H3478]] were found [[H4672]] in you.  
14 Therefore, [[H3651]] send [[H5414]] farewell gifts [[H7964]] to [[H5921]] Moresheth-gath; [[H4182]] the houses [[H1004]] of Achzib [[H392]] [will] prove deceptive [[H391]] to the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
15 I will again [[H5750]] bring [[H935]] a conqueror [[H3423]] against you,  O inhabitant [[H3427]] of Mareshah. [[H4762]] The glory [[H3519]] of Israel [[H3478]] will come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Adullam. [[H5725]] 
16 Shave yourselves bald [[H7139]] and cut off your hair [[H1494]] in morning for [[H5921]] your precious [[H8588]] children; [[H1121]] make yourselves [[H7337]] as bald [[H7144]] as an eagle, [[H5404]] for [[H3588]] they will go from you [[H4480]] into exile. [[H1540]]
