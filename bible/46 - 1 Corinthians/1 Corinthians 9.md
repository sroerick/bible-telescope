# 1 Corinthians 9
[[1 Corinthians 8|←]] • [[1 Corinthians 10|→]]
1 Am I [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] free? [[G1658]] Am I [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] an apostle? [[G652]] Have I not seen [[G3708]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord? [[G2962]] Are [[G1510]] you [yourselves] [[G4771]] not [[G3756]] my [[G1473]] workmanship [[G2041]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord? [[G2962]] 
2 Even if [[G1487]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] an apostle [[G652]] to others, [[G243]] surely [[G1065]] I am [[G1510]] to you. [[G4771]] For [[G1063]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] seal [[G4973]] of my [[G1473]] apostleship [[G651]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
3 This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] my [[G1699]] defense [[G627]] to those who [[G3588]] scrutinize [[G350]] me: [[G1473]] 
4 Have we [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] right [[G1849]] to food [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] to drink? [[G4095]] 
5 Have we [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] right [[G1849]] to take along [[G4013]] a believing [[G79]] wife, [[G1135]] as [[G5613]] [do] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] brothers [[G80]] and [[G2532]] Cephas? [[G2786]] 
6 Or {are} [[G2228]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] the only [ apostles ] [[G3441]] who must [[G3756]] work for a living? [[G2038]] 
7 Who [[G5101]] serves as a soldier [[G4754]] at his own [[G2398]] expense? [[G3800]] Who [[G5101]] plants [[G5452]] a vineyard [[G290]] and [[G2532]] does not eat of [[G2068]] its [[G846]] fruit? [[G2590]] Who [[G5101]] tends [[G4165]] a flock [[G4167]] and [[G2532]] does not drink [[G2068]] of [[G1537]] [its] [[G4167]] milk? [[G1051]] 
8 Do I say [[G2980]] this [[G3778]] from a human perspective? [[G2596]] Doesn’t [[G3756]] [the] Law [[G3551]] say [[G3004]] the same thing? [[G3778]] 
9 For [[G1063]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of Moses: [[G3475]] “Do not muzzle [[G5392]] an ox [[G1016]] [while it is] treading out the grain.” [[G248]] [Is it] [[G3361]] about [[G3588]] oxen [[G1016]] [that] God [[G2316]] is concerned? [[G3199]] 
10 Isn’t [[G2228]] He actually speaking [[G3004]] on our behalf? [[G1223]] Indeed, [[G1063]] this was written [[G1125]] for [[G1223]] us, [[G1473]] because [[G3754]] [when] the [[G3588]] plowman [[G722]] plows [[G722]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] thresher [ threshes ], [[G248]] [they] should [[G3784]] [also] expect [[G1680]] to share in the harvest. [[G3348]] 
11 If [[G1487]] we [[G1473]] have sown [[G4687]] spiritual [seed] [[G4152]] among you, [[G4771]] [is it] too much [[G3173]] for us [[G1473]] to reap [[G2325]] a material [harvest] [[G4559]] from you? [[G4771]] 
12 If [[G1487]] others [[G243]] have [[G3348]] [this] [[G3588]] right [[G1849]] to your [support], [[G4771]] shouldn’t [[G3756]] we [[G1473]] [have it] all the more? [[G3123]] But [[G235]] we did not exercise [[G5530]] this [[G3778]] right. [[G1849]] Instead, [[G235]] we put up with [[G4722]] anything [[G3956]] rather than [[G2443]] hinder [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
13 Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] those who [[G3588]] work [[G2038]] in the [[G3588]] temple [[G2413]] eat of [[G2068]] [its food], [[G3588]] [and] those who [[G3588]] serve [[G4332]] at the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] partake [[G4829]] of [its] [[G3588]] [offerings]? [[G2379]] 
14 In the same way, [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has prescribed that [[G1299]] those who [[G3588]] preach [[G2605]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] should receive their living [[G2198]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]] 
15 But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] have not used [[G5530]] [any] [[G3762]] of these [rights]. [[G3778]] And [[G1161]] I am not writing [[G1125]] this [[G3778]] to suggest that [[G2443]] something [[G3779]] be done [[G1096]] for [[G1722]] me. [[G1473]] Indeed, [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] would rather [[G3123]] die [[G599]] than for [[G2228]] anyone [[G3762]] to nullify [[G2758]] my [[G1473]] boast. [[G2745]] 
16 Yet [[G1063]] when [[G1437]] I preach the gospel, [[G2097]] I [[G1473]] have [[G1510]] no reason [[G3756]] to boast, [[G2745]] because [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] am obligated [to preach]. [[G318]] Woe [[G3759]] to me [[G1473]] if [[G1437]] I do not preach the gospel! [[G2097]] 
17 If [[G1487]] my [[G4238]] [preaching] [[G3778]] [is] voluntary, [[G1635]] I have [[G2192]] a reward. [[G3408]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] [it is] not voluntary, [[G210]] I am [still] entrusted with [[G4100]] [a] responsibility. [[G3622]] 
18 What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] is [[G1510]] my [[G1473]] reward? [[G3408]] That [[G2443]] in preaching the gospel [[G2097]] I may offer [[G5087]] [it] [[G2098]] free of charge, [[G77]] and so [[G1519]] not [[G3361]] use up [[G2710]] my [[G1473]] rights [[G1849]] in [[G1722]] [preaching] [[G3588]] [it]. [[G2098]] 
19 Though [[G1063]] I am [[G1510]] free of obligation [[G1658]] to [[G1537]] anyone, [[G3956]] I make myself a slave [[G1402]] to everyone, [[G3956]] to [[G2443]] win [[G2770]] as many as possible. [[G4119]] 
20 To the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] I became [[G1096]] like [[G5613]] a Jew, [[G2453]] to [[G2443]] win [[G2770]] [the] Jews. [[G2453]] To those [[G3588]] under [[G5259]] [the] Law [[G3551]] [I became like one] [[G5613]] under [[G5259]] [the] Law [[G3551]] ([though I] myself [[G846]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] under [[G5259]] [the] Law), [[G3551]] to [[G2443]] win [[G2770]] those [[G3588]] under [[G5259]] [the] Law. [[G3551]] 
21 To those [[G3588]] without [the] Law [[G459]] [I became like one] [[G5613]] without [the] Law [[G459]] ([though I] am [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] outside [the] law [[G459]] of God [[G2316]] but [am] [[G235]] under [the] law [[G1772]] of Christ), [[G5547]] to [[G2443]] win [[G2770]] those [[G3588]] without [the] Law. [[G459]] 
22 To the [[G3588]] weak [[G772]] I became [[G1096]] weak, [[G772]] to [[G2443]] win [[G2770]] the [[G3588]] weak. [[G772]] I have become [[G1096]] all [[G3956]] things [[G3588]] to all [men], [[G3956]] so that [[G2443]] by all possible means [[G3843]] I might save [[G4982]] some [of them]. [[G5100]] 
23 I do [[G4160]] all [this] [[G3956]] for the sake of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] so that [[G2443]] I may share [[G1096]] in its [blessings]. [[G846]] 
24 Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] a race [[G4712]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] runners [[G5143]] run, [[G5143]] but [[G1161]] only one [[G1520]] receives [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] prize? [[G1017]] Run [[G5143]] in such a way [[G3779]] as to [[G2443]] take [the prize]. [[G2638]] 
25 Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] competes in the games [[G75]] trains with strict discipline. [[G1467]] They [do it] [[G1565]] [for] [[G2983]] a crown [[G4735]] [that is] perishable, [[G5349]] but [[G1161]] we [ do it for a crown ] [[G1473]] [that is] imperishable. [[G862]] 
26 Therefore [[G5106]] I [[G1473]] do not run [[G5143]] aimlessly; [[G84]] I do not fight [[G4438]] like [[G3779]] I am beating [[G1194]] [the] air. [[G109]] 
27 No, [[G235]] I discipline [[G5299]] my [[G1473]] body [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] make it my slave, [[G1396]] [so that] after I have preached [[G2784]] to others, [[G243]] I myself [[G846]] will not be [[G1096]] disqualified. [[G96]]
