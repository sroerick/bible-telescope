1 If [[G1437]] I speak [[G2980]] in the [[G3588]] tongues [[G1100]] of men [[G444]] and [[G2532]] of angels, [[G32]] but [[G1161]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] love, [[G26]] I am [[G1096]] [only a] ringing [[G2278]] gong [[G5475]] or [[G2228]] [a] clanging [[G214]] cymbal. [[G2950]] 
2 If [[G1437]] I have [[G2192]] the gift of prophecy [[G4394]] and [[G2532]] can fathom [[G1492]] all [[G3956]] mysteries [[G3466]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] knowledge, [[G1108]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] I have [[G2192]] absolute [[G3956]] faith [[G4102]] so as [[G5620]] to move [[G3179]] mountains, [[G3735]] but [[G1161]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] love, [[G26]] I am [[G1510]] nothing. [[G3762]] 
3 If [[G1437]] I give [[G5595]] all [[G3956]] I [[G1473]] possess {to the poor} [[G5225]] and [[G2532]] exult [[G2744]] in the surrender [[G3860]] of my [[G1473]] body, [[G4983]] but [[G1161]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] love, [[G26]] I gain [[G5623]] nothing. [[G3762]] 
4 Love [[G26]] is patient, [[G3114]] love [[G26]] is kind. [[G5541]] [It] [[G26]] does not envy, [[G2206]] it does not boast, [[G4068]] it is not proud. [[G5448]] 
5 It is not rude, [[G807]] it is not self-seeking, [[G2212]] it is not easily angered, [[G3947]] it keeps no account [[G3049]] of wrongs. [[G2556]] 
6 [Love] takes no pleasure [[G5463]] in [[G1909]] evil, [[G93]] but [[G1161]] rejoices [[G4796]] in the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] 
7 It bears [[G4722]] all things, [[G3956]] believes [[G4100]] all things, [[G3956]] hopes [[G1679]] all things, [[G3956]] endures [[G5278]] all things. [[G3956]] 
8 Love [[G26]] never [[G3763]] fails. [[G4098]] But [[G1161]] where [[G1535]] [there are] prophecies, [[G4394]] they will cease; [[G2673]] where [[G1535]] [there are] tongues, [[G1100]] they will be restrained; [[G3973]] where [[G1535]] [there is] knowledge, [[G1108]] it will be dismissed. [[G2673]] 
9 For [[G1063]] we know [[G1097]] in [[G1537]] part [[G3313]] and [[G2532]] we prophesy [[G4395]] in [[G1537]] part, [[G3313]] 
10 but [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] perfect [[G5046]] comes, [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] partial [[G3313]] passes away. [[G2673]] 
11 When [[G3753]] I was [[G1510]] a child, [[G3516]] I talked [[G2980]] like [[G5613]] a child, [[G3516]] I thought [[G5426]] like [[G5613]] a child, [[G3516]] I reasoned [[G3049]] like [[G5613]] a child. [[G3516]] When [[G3753]] I became [[G1096]] a man, [[G435]] I set aside [[G2673]] childish ways. [[G3516]] 
12 Now [[G737]] we see [[G991]] but a dim reflection [[G135]] as in [[G1223]] a mirror; [[G2072]] then [we shall see] [[G5119]] face [[G4383]] to [[G4314]] face. [[G4383]] Now [[G737]] I know [[G1097]] in [[G1537]] part; [[G3313]] then [[G5119]] I shall know fully, [[G1921]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] I am fully known. [[G1921]] 
13 And [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] these [[G3778]] three [[G5140]] remain: [[G3306]] faith, [[G4102]] hope, [[G1680]] [and] love; [[G26]] but [[G1161]] [the] greatest [[G3173]] of these [is] [[G3778]] love. [[G26]]
