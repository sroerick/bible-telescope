1 Earnestly pursue [[G1377]] love [[G26]] and [[G1161]] eagerly desire [[G2206]] spiritual gifts, [[G4152]] especially [[G3123]] [the gift] [[G2443]] of prophecy. [[G4395]] 
2 For [[G1063]] he who [[G3588]] speaks [[G2980]] in a tongue [[G1100]] does not speak [[G2980]] to men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] to God. [[G2316]] Indeed, [[G1063]] no one [[G3762]] understands [him]; [[G191]] he utters [[G2980]] mysteries [[G3466]] in the Spirit. [[G4151]] 
3 But [[G1161]] he who [[G3588]] prophesies [[G4395]] speaks [[G2980]] to men [[G444]] [for their] edification, [[G3619]] encouragement, [[G3874]] and [[G2532]] comfort. [[G3889]] 
4 The [one who] [[G3588]] speaks [[G2980]] in a tongue [[G1100]] edifies [[G3618]] himself, [[G1438]] but [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] prophesies [[G4395]] edifies [[G3618]] [the] church. [[G1577]] 
5 I wish that [[G2309]] all [[G3956]] of you [[G4771]] could speak [[G2980]] in tongues, [[G1100]] but [[G1161]] {I would} rather [[G3123]] have [[G2443]] you prophesy. [[G4395]] He who [[G3588]] prophesies [[G4395]] [is] greater [[G3173]] than [[G2228]] [one who] [[G3588]] speaks [[G2980]] in tongues, [[G1100]] unless [[G1622]] he interprets, [[G1329]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] may be [[G2983]] edified. [[G3619]] 
6 Now, [[G3568]] brothers, [[G80]] if [[G1437]] I come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] speaking [[G2980]] in tongues, [[G1100]] how [[G5101]] will I benefit [[G5623]] you, [[G4771]] unless [[G1437]] I [bring] [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] [some] revelation [[G602]] or [[G2228]] knowledge [[G1108]] or [[G2228]] prophecy [[G4394]] or [[G2228]] teaching? [[G1322]] 
7 Even in the case of [[G3676]] lifeless [[G895]] instruments, [[G1325]] such as [[G1535]] [the] flute [[G836]] or [[G1535]] harp, [[G2788]] how [[G4459]] will [anyone] recognize [[G1097]] [the tune] [[G3588]] they are playing [[G1325]] unless [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] notes [[G5353]] are distinct? [[G1293]] 
8 Again, [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] [the] trumpet [[G4536]] sounds [[G1325]] a muffled [[G82]] call, [[G5456]] who [[G5101]] will prepare [[G3903]] for [[G1519]] battle? [[G4171]] 
9 So [[G3779]] [it is] [[G2532]] with you. [[G4771]] Unless [[G1437]] you speak [[G1325]] intelligible [[G2154]] words [[G3056]] with [[G1223]] [your] [[G3588]] tongue, [[G1100]] how [[G4459]] will [anyone] know [[G1097]] what [[G3588]] you are saying? [[G2980]] You will [ just ] be [[G1510]] speaking [[G2980]] into [[G1519]] [the] air. [[G109]] 
10 Assuredly, [[G5177]] there are [[G1510]] many [[G5118]] different [[G1085]] languages [[G5456]] in [[G1722]] [the] world, [[G2889]] yet [[G2532]] none [of them is] [[G3762]] without meaning. [[G880]] 
11 If, [[G1437]] then, [[G3767]] I do not know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] meaning [[G1411]] of someone’s [[G3588]] language, [[G5456]] I am [[G1510]] a foreigner [[G915]] to the [[G3588]] speaker, [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] [he is] [[G2980]] a foreigner [[G915]] to [[G1722]] me. [[G1473]] 
12 It is the same [[G3779]] with you. [[G4771]] Since [[G1893]] you are [[G1510]] eager to have [[G2207]] spiritual gifts, [[G4151]] strive [[G2212]] to [[G2443]] excel [[G4052]] [in gifts that] [[G3588]] build up [[G3619]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]] 
13 Therefore, [[G1352]] the [one who] [[G3588]] speaks [[G2980]] in a tongue [[G1100]] should pray [[G4336]] that [[G2443]] he may interpret. [[G1329]] 
14 For [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] I pray [[G4336]] in a tongue, [[G1100]] my [[G1473]] spirit [[G4151]] prays, [[G4336]] but [[G1161]] my [[G1473]] mind [[G3563]] is [[G1510]] unfruitful. [[G175]] 
15 What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] [shall I do]? [[G1510]] I will pray [[G4336]] with [my] [[G3588]] spirit, [[G4151]] but [[G1161]] I will also pray [[G4336]] with [my] [[G3588]] mind. [[G3563]] I will sing [[G5567]] with [my] [[G3588]] spirit, [[G4151]] but [[G1161]] I will also sing [[G5567]] with [my] [[G3588]] mind. [[G3563]] 
16 Otherwise, [[G1893]] if [[G1437]] you speak a blessing [[G2127]] in [[G1722]] spirit, [[G4151]] how [[G4459]] {can} [someone] [[G3588]] who is uninstructed [[G2399]] say [[G2046]] “Amen” [[G281]] to [[G1909]] your [[G4674]] thanksgiving, [[G2169]] since [[G1894]] he does not know [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] you are saying? [[G3004]] 
17 You {may} [[G4771]] be giving thanks [[G2168]] well enough, [[G2573]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] other one [[G2087]] is not edified. [[G3618]] 
18 I thank [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] that I speak [[G2980]] in tongues [[G1100]] more [[G3123]] than all [[G3956]] of you. [[G4771]] 
19 But [[G235]] in [[G1722]] [the] church, [[G1577]] I would rather [[G2309]] speak [[G2980]] five [[G4002]] coherent [[G3563]] words [[G3056]] to [[G2443]] instruct [[G2727]] others [[G243]] than [[G2228]] ten thousand [[G3463]] words [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] a tongue. [[G1100]] 
20 Brothers, [[G80]] stop [[G3361]] thinking [[G5424]] like children. [[G3813]] In [regard to] [[G3588]] evil [[G2549]] be infants, [[G3515]] but [[G1161]] in [your] [[G3588]] thinking [[G5424]] be [[G1096]] mature. [[G5046]] 
21 It is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law: [[G3551]] “By [[G1722]] strange tongues [[G2084]] and [[G2532]] foreign [[G2087]] lips [[G5491]] I will speak [[G2980]] to this [[G3778]] people, [[G2992]] [but] [[G2532]] even [[G3761]] then [[G3779]] they will {not} listen to [[G1522]] Me, [[G1473]] says [[G3004]] [the] Lord.” [[G2962]] 
22 Tongues, [[G1100]] then, [[G5620]] are [[G1510]] a sign, [[G4592]] not [[G3756]] for [[G3588]] believers, [[G4100]] but [[G235]] for [[G3588]] unbelievers. [[G571]] Prophecy, [[G4394]] however, [[G235]] [is] for [[G3588]] believers, [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] for [[G3588]] unbelievers. [[G571]] 
23 So [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] church [[G1577]] comes [[G4905]] together [[G1909]] and [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] speaks [[G2980]] in tongues, [[G1100]] and [[G1161]] some who are uninstructed [[G2399]] or [[G2228]] some unbelievers [[G571]] come in, [[G1525]] will they not say [[G2046]] that [[G3754]] you are out of your minds? [[G3105]] 
24 But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] an [[G5100]] unbeliever [[G571]] or [[G2228]] uninstructed person [[G2399]] comes in [[G1525]] while [[G1161]] everyone [[G3956]] is prophesying, [[G4395]] he will be convicted [[G1651]] [and] called to account [[G350]] by [[G5259]] all, [[G3956]] 
25 [and] the [[G3588]] secrets [[G2927]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] will be [[G1096]] revealed. [[G5318]] So [[G2532]] he will fall [[G4098]] facedown [[G4383]] [and] worship [[G4352]] God, [[G2316]] proclaiming, [[G518]] “God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] truly [[G3689]] among [[G1722]] you!” [[G4771]] 
26 What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] [shall we say], [[G1510]] brothers? [[G80]] When [[G3752]] you come together, [[G4905]] everyone [[G1538]] has [[G2192]] a psalm [[G5568]] [or] [[G2192]] a teaching, [[G1322]] a revelation, [[G602]] a tongue, [[G1100]] [or] [[G2192]] an interpretation. [[G2058]] All [of these] [[G3956]] must be done [[G1096]] to [[G4314]] build up [ the church ]. [[G3619]] 
27 If [[G1535]] anyone [[G5100]] speaks [[G2980]] in a tongue, [[G1100]] two, [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] [at] [[G3588]] most [[G4118]] three, [[G5140]] [should speak] [[G2596]] in [[G303]] turn, [[G3313]] and [[G2532]] someone [[G1520]] must interpret. [[G1329]] 
28 But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3361]] interpreter, [[G1328]] he should remain silent [[G4601]] in [[G1722]] [the] church [[G1577]] and [[G1161]] speak [only] [[G2980]] to himself [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] God. [[G2316]] 
29 Two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] prophets [[G4396]] should speak, [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] others [[G243]] should weigh carefully [what is said]. [[G1252]] 
30 And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] a revelation comes [[G601]] to someone who [[G243]] is seated, [[G2521]] the [[G3588]] first [speaker] [[G4413]] should hold his peace. [[G4601]] 
31 For [[G1063]] you can [[G1410]] all [[G3956]] prophesy [[G4395]] in [[G2596]] [turn] [[G1520]] so that [[G2443]] everyone [[G3956]] may be instructed [[G3129]] and [[G2532]] encouraged. [[G3870]] 
32 [The] spirits [[G4151]] of prophets [[G4396]] are subject [[G5293]] to prophets. [[G4396]] 
33 For [[G1063]] [God] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] a God [[G2316]] of disorder, [[G181]] but [[G235]] of peace. [[G1515]] As [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] congregations [[G1577]] of the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] 
34 women [[G1135]] are to be silent [[G4601]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]] They [[G846]] are not permitted [[G2010]] to speak, [[G2980]] but [[G235]] must be in submission, [[G5293]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] says. [[G3004]] 
35 If [[G1487]] they wish [[G2309]] to inquire about [[G3129]] something, [[G5100]] they are to ask [[G1905]] [their] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] husbands [[G435]] at [[G1722]] home; [[G3624]] for [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] dishonorable [[G150]] for a woman [[G1135]] to speak [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] [the] church. [[G1577]] 
36 {Did} [[G2228]] God’s [[G2316]] word [[G3056]] originate [[G1831]] with [[G575]] you? [[G4771]] Or [[G2228]] [are] you [[G4771]] the only [ones] [[G3441]] it has reached? [[G2658]] 
37 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] considers [[G1380]] [himself] [[G1510]] a prophet [[G4396]] or [[G2228]] spiritual person, [[G4152]] let him acknowledge [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] what [[G3739]] I am writing [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] is [[G1510]] [the] Lord’s [[G2962]] command. [[G1785]] 
38 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] ignores this, [[G50]] he himself will be ignored. [[G50]] 
39 So, [[G5620]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] be eager [[G2206]] to prophesy [[G4395]] and [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] forbid [[G2967]] speaking [[G2980]] in tongues. [[G1100]] 
40 But [[G1161]] everything [[G3956]] must be done [[G1096]] in a proper [[G2156]] and [[G2532]] orderly [manner]. [[G5010]]
