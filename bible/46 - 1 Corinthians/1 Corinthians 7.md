1 Now [[G1161]] for [[G4012]] the matters [[G3739]] you wrote about: [[G1125]] [It is] good [[G2570]] to abstain from sexual relations. [[G680]] 
2 But [[G1161]] because [[G1223]] [there is so much] [[G3588]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] each man [[G1538]] should have [[G2192]] his [[G1438]] [own] [[G3588]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] each woman [[G1538]] [her] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] husband. [[G435]] 
3 The [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] should fulfill [[G591]] [his] [[G3588]] [marital] duty [[G3782]] to [his] [[G3588]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G1161]] likewise [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] wife [[G1135]] to [her] [[G3588]] husband. [[G435]] 
4 The [[G3588]] wife [[G1135]] [does] not [[G3756]] have authority over [[G1850]] [her] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] body, [[G4983]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] husband. [[G435]] Likewise [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] [does] not [[G3756]] have authority over [[G1850]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] body, [[G4983]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] wife. [[G1135]] 
5 {Do} not [[G3361]] deprive [[G650]] one another, [[G240]] except [[G1487]] by [[G1537]] mutual consent [[G4859]] for [[G4314]] a limited time, [[G2540]] so [[G2443]] you may devote yourselves [[G4980]] to prayer. [[G4335]] Then [[G2532]] come [[G1510]] together [[G1909]] again, [[G3825]] so that [[G2443]] Satan [[G4567]] will not tempt [[G3985]] you [[G4771]] through [[G1223]] your [[G4771]] lack of self-control. [[G192]] 
6 I say [[G3004]] this [[G3778]] as [[G2596]] a concession, [[G4774]] not [[G3756]] as [[G2596]] a command. [[G2003]] 
7 I wish that [[G2309]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] were [[G1510]] as [[G5613]] I am. [[G1683]] But [[G235]] each [man] [[G1538]] has [[G2192]] his own [[G2398]] gift [[G5486]] from [[G1537]] God; [[G2316]] one [has] [[G3588]] this [gift], [[G3779]] another [has] [[G3588]] that. [[G3779]] 
8 Now [[G1161]] to the [[G3588]] unmarried [[G22]] and [[G2532]] widows [[G5503]] I say [this]: [[G3004]] [It is] good [[G2570]] for them [[G846]] to remain [unmarried], [[G3306]] as [[G5613]] I am. [[G2504]] 
9 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] they cannot control themselves, [[G1467]] let them marry. [[G1060]] For [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] better [[G2909]] to marry [[G1060]] than [[G2228]] to burn with passion. [[G4448]] 
10 To the [[G3588]] married [[G1060]] I give this command [[G3853]] (not [[G3756]] I, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Lord): [[G2962]] A wife [[G1135]] must not separate [[G5563]] from [[G575]] [her] husband. [[G435]] 
11 But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] she [does], [[G5563]] she must remain [[G3306]] unmarried [[G22]] or else [[G2228]] be reconciled [[G2644]] to [her] [[G3588]] husband. [[G435]] And [[G2532]] a husband [[G435]] must not divorce [[G863]] [his] wife. [[G1135]] 
12 To the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] I [[G1473]] say this [[G3004]] ([I,] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Lord): [[G2962]] If [[G1487]] a [[G5100]] brother [[G80]] has [[G2192]] an unbelieving [[G571]] wife [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] she [[G3778]] is willing [[G4909]] to live [[G3611]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] he must not divorce [[G863]] her. [[G846]] 
13 And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] a [[G5100]] woman [[G1135]] has [[G2192]] an unbelieving [[G571]] husband [[G435]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3778]] is willing [[G4909]] to live [[G3611]] with [[G3326]] her, [[G846]] she must not divorce [[G863]] [him]. [[G435]] 
14 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] unbelieving [[G571]] husband [[G435]] is sanctified [[G37]] through [[G1722]] [his] [[G3588]] [believing] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unbelieving [[G571]] wife [[G1135]] is sanctified [[G37]] through [[G1722]] [her] [[G3588]] [believing] husband. [[G80]] Otherwise [[G1893]] your [[G4771]] children [[G5043]] would be [[G1510]] unclean, [[G169]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] they are [[G1510]] holy. [[G40]] 
15 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] unbeliever [[G571]] leaves, [[G5563]] let him go. [[G5563]] The [ believing ] [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] or [[G2228]] sister [[G79]] is not bound [[G1402]] in [[G1722]] such [cases]. [[G5108]] God [[G2316]] has called [[G2564]] you [[G4771]] [to live] in [[G1722]] peace. [[G1515]] 
16 How [[G5101]] do you know, [[G1492]] wife, [[G1135]] whether [[G1487]] you will save [[G4982]] [your] [[G3588]] husband? [[G435]] Or [[G2228]] how [[G5101]] do you know, [[G1492]] husband, [[G435]] whether [[G1487]] you will save [[G4982]] [your] [[G3588]] wife? [[G1135]] 
17 Regardless, [[G1487]] each one [[G1538]] should lead [[G4043]] [ the life ] [[G3779]] [that] [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has assigned [to him] [[G3307]] [and to which] [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] has called [[G2564]] [him]. [[G1538]] This [is what] [[G3779]] I prescribe [[G1299]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]] 
18 {Was} a man [[G5100]] already circumcised [[G4059]] when he was called? [[G2564]] He should not become uncircumcised. [[G1986]] {Was} a man [[G5100]] still uncircumcised [[G203]] when called? [[G2564]] He should not be circumcised. [[G4059]] 
19 Circumcision [[G4061]] is [[G1510]] nothing [[G3762]] and [[G2532]] uncircumcision [[G203]] is [[G1510]] nothing. [[G3762]] Keeping [[G5084]] God’s [[G2316]] commandments [is what matters]. [[G1785]] 
20 Each [one] [[G1538]] should remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] situation [[G2821]] [he was] in [[G3739]] when he was called. [[G2564]] 
21 Were you a slave when you were called? [[G2564]] Do not let it concern [[G3199]] you, [[G4771]] but [[G235]] if [[G1487]] you can [[G1410]] gain [[G1096]] [your] freedom, [[G1658]] take the opportunity. [[G5530]] 
22 For [[G1063]] he who [[G3588]] [was] a slave [[G1401]] when he was called [[G2564]] by [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G1510]] [the] Lord’s [[G2962]] freedman. [[G558]] Conversely, [[G3668]] he who [[G3588]] [was] a free man [[G1658]] when he was called [[G2564]] is [[G1510]] Christ’s [[G5547]] slave. [[G1401]] 
23 You were bought [[G59]] at a price; [[G5092]] {do} not [[G3361]] become [[G1096]] slaves [[G1401]] of men. [[G444]] 
24 Brothers, [[G80]] each one [[G1538]] should remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3778]] [situation] [[G3739]] he was in [[G1722]] when God called him. [[G2564]] 
25 Now [[G1161]] about [[G4012]] virgins, [[G3933]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] command [[G2003]] from [the] Lord, [[G2962]] but [[G1161]] I give [[G1325]] a judgment [[G1106]] as [one who] [[G5613]] by [[G5259]] [the] Lord’s [[G2962]] mercy [[G1653]] is [[G1510]] trustworthy. [[G4103]] 
26 Because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] present [[G1764]] crisis, [[G318]] I think [[G3543]] [it] [[G3778]] is [[G5225]] good [[G2570]] for a man [[G444]] to remain [[G1510]] as [he is]. [[G3779]] 
27 Are you committed [[G1210]] to a wife? [[G1135]] {Do} not [[G3361]] seek [[G2212]] to be released. [[G3080]] Are you free [[G3089]] of [[G575]] [commitment]? [[G1135]] {Do} not [[G3361]] look for [[G2212]] a wife. [[G1135]] 
28 But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] you do marry, [[G1060]] you have not sinned. [[G264]] And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] a virgin [[G3933]] marries, [[G1060]] she has not sinned. [[G264]] But [[G1161]] [those who marry] [[G5108]] will face [[G2192]] troubles [[G2347]] in [this] [[G3588]] life, [[G4561]] and [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] [want to] spare [[G5339]] you [this]. [[G4771]] 
29 [What] [[G1161]] I am saying, [[G5346]] brothers, [[G80]] [is] that [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] is [[G1510]] short. [[G4958]] From now on [[G3063]] those who [[G3588]] have [[G2192]] wives [[G1135]] should live [[G1510]] as if [[G5613]] they had [[G2192]] none; [[G3361]] 
30 those who [[G3588]] weep, [[G2799]] as if [[G5613]] they [did not]; [[G2799]] those who [[G3588]] are joyful, [[G5463]] as if [[G5613]] they were not; [[G5463]] those who [[G3588]] make a purchase, [[G59]] as if [[G5613]] they had nothing; [[G2722]] 
31 and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] use [[G5530]] the things of [[G3588]] [this] world, [[G2889]] as if [[G5613]] not dependent on them. [[G2710]] For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] world [[G2889]] [in its] [[G3588]] present form [[G4976]] is passing away. [[G3855]] 
32 I want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be [[G1510]] free from concern. [[G275]] The [[G3588]] unmarried man [[G22]] is concerned about [[G3309]] the [work] [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G4459]] he can please [[G700]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
33 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] married man [[G1060]] is concerned about [[G3309]] the [affairs] [[G3588]] of this [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] how [[G4459]] he can please [[G700]] [his] [[G3588]] wife, [[G1135]] 
34 and [[G2532]] [his interests] are divided. [[G3307]] The [[G3588]] unmarried [[G22]] woman [[G1135]] [or] [[G2532]] virgin [[G3933]] is concerned about [[G3309]] the [work] [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G2443]] she can be [[G1510]] holy [[G40]] in [[G3588]] both [[G2532]] body [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] spirit. [[G4151]] But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] married woman [[G1060]] is concerned about [[G3309]] the [affairs] [[G3588]] of this [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] how [[G4459]] she can please [[G700]] [her] [[G3588]] husband. [[G435]] 
35 I am saying [[G3004]] this [[G3778]] for [[G4314]] your [[G4771]] own [[G846]] good, [[G4851]] not [[G3756]] to [[G2443]] restrict [[G1911]] you, [[G4771]] but [[G235]] in order to promote [[G4314]] proper decorum [[G2158]] and [[G2532]] undivided [[G563]] devotion [[G2145]] to the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
36 However, [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] someone [[G5100]] thinks [[G3543]] he is acting inappropriately [[G807]] toward [[G1909]] his [[G846]] betrothed, [[G3933]] [and] if [[G1437]] she is [[G1510]] beyond [her] youth [[G5230]] and [[G2532]] [they] ought [[G3784]] [to marry], [[G3779]] let him do [[G4160]] as [[G3739]] he wishes; [[G2309]] he is not sinning; [[G264]] they should get married. [[G1060]] 
37 But [[G1161]] the [man who] [[G3739]] [is] firmly [[G1476]] established [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] [and] under [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] constraint, [[G318]] with [[G2192]] control [[G1849]] over [[G4012]] [his] [[G2398]] will [[G2307]] and [[G2532]] resolve [[G2919]] in [[G1722]] [his] [[G2398]] heart [[G2588]] [not to marry] [[G5083]] the [[G1438]] virgin, [[G3933]] he will do [[G4160]] well. [[G2573]] 
38 So then, [[G5620]] he who [[G3588]] [marries] [[G1061]] the [[G3588]] virgin [[G3933]] does [[G4160]] well, [[G2573]] but [[G2532]] he who [[G3588]] {does} not [[G3361]] [marry her] [[G1061]] does [[G4160]] even better. [[G2908]] 
39 A wife [[G1135]] is bound [[G1210]] to her [[G846]] husband [[G435]] as long as [[G3745]] he lives. [[G2198]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] [her] [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] dies, [[G2837]] she is [[G1510]] free [[G1658]] to marry [[G1060]] anyone [[G3739]] she wishes, [[G2309]] as long as [[G3440]] [he] belongs to [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
40 In [[G2596]] my [[G1699]] judgment, [[G1106]] however, [[G1161]] she is [[G1510]] happier [[G3107]] if [[G1437]] she remains [[G3306]] as she is. [[G3779]] And [[G1161]] I think that [[G1380]] I too [[G2504]] have [[G2192]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of God. [[G2316]]
