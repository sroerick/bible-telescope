[[1 Corinthians 1|←]] • [[1 Corinthians 3|→]]
1 [When] I [[G2504]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] I did not come [[G2064]] with [[G2596]] eloquence [[G5247]] or [[G2228]] wisdom [[G4678]] [as] I proclaimed [[G2605]] to you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3142]] about God. [[G2316]] 
2 For [[G1063]] I decided [[G2919]] to know [[G1492]] nothing [[G3756]] [while I was] with [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] except [[G1487]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] Him [[G3778]] crucified. [[G4717]] 
3 I [[G2504]] came [[G1096]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] weakness [[G769]] and [[G2532]] fear, [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] much [[G4183]] trembling. [[G5156]] 
4 My [[G1473]] message [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] preaching [[G2782]] [were] not [[G3756]] with [[G1722]] persuasive [[G3981]] words [[G3056]] of wisdom, [[G4678]] but [[G235]] with [[G1722]] a demonstration [[G585]] of [the] Spirit’s [[G4151]] power, [[G1411]] 
5 so that [[G2443]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] would not rest [[G1510]] on [[G1722]] men’s [[G444]] wisdom, [[G4678]] but [[G235]] on [[G1722]] God’s [[G2316]] power. [[G1411]] 
6 Among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mature, [[G5046]] however, [[G1161]] we speak a message [[G2980]] of wisdom— [[G4678]] but [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] [the] wisdom [[G4678]] of this [[G3778]] age [[G165]] [or] [[G3761]] of the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] of this [[G3778]] age, [[G165]] who [[G3588]] are coming to nothing. [[G2673]] 
7 No, [[G235]] we speak of [[G2980]] [the] mysterious [[G3466]] [and] hidden [[G613]] wisdom [[G4678]] of God, [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] [He] [[G2316]] destined [[G4309]] for [[G1519]] our [[G1473]] glory [[G1391]] before [[G4253]] time [began]. [[G165]] 
8 None [[G3762]] of the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] of this [[G3778]] age [[G165]] understood [[G1097]] [it]. [[G3739]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] they had, [[G1097]] they would not have crucified [[G4717]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] of glory. [[G1391]] 
9 Rather, [[G235]] as [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “No [[G3756]] eye [[G3788]] has seen, [[G3708]] no [[G3756]] ear [[G3775]] has heard, [[G191]] no [[G3756]] heart [[G2588]] has imagined, [[G305]] what [[G3745]] God [[G2316]] has prepared [[G2090]] for those who [[G3588]] love [[G25]] Him.” [[G846]] 
10 But [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] has revealed [it] [[G601]] to us [[G1473]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Spirit. [[G4151]] The [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] searches [[G2045]] all things, [[G3956]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] deep [ things ] [[G899]] of God. [[G2316]] 
11 For [[G1063]] who [[G5101]] among men [[G444]] knows [[G1492]] the [thoughts] [[G3588]] of man [[G444]] except [[G1487]] [his own] [[G444]] spirit [[G4151]] within [[G1722]] him? [[G846]] So [[G3779]] too, [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] knows [[G1097]] the [thoughts] [[G3588]] of God [[G2316]] except [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of God. [[G2316]] 
12 We [[G1473]] have not received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] who [is] [[G3588]] from [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] we may understand [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] has freely given [[G5483]] us. [[G1473]] 
13 And [[G2532]] [this is] [[G3739]] [what] we speak, [[G2980]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] words [[G3056]] taught [us] [[G1318]] by human [[G442]] wisdom, [[G4678]] but [[G235]] in [words] [[G1722]] taught [[G1318]] by [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] expressing [[G4793]] spiritual truths [[G4152]] in spiritual [words]. [[G4152]] 
14 [The] natural [[G5591]] man [[G444]] {does} not [[G3756]] accept [[G1209]] the things that [[G3588]] come from the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of God. [[G2316]] For [[G1063]] they are [[G1510]] foolishness [[G3472]] to him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he cannot [[G1410]] understand [them], [[G1097]] because [[G3754]] {they are} spiritually [[G4153]] discerned. [[G350]] 
15 The [[G3588]] spiritual [man] [[G4152]] judges [[G350]] all things, [[G3956]] but [[G1161]] he himself [[G846]] is not subject to anyone’s judgment. [[G350]] 
16 “For [[G1063]] who [[G5101]] has known [[G1097]] [the] mind [[G3563]] of [the] Lord, [[G2962]] [so as] [[G3739]] to instruct [[G4822]] Him?” [[G846]] But [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] [the] mind [[G3563]] of Christ. [[G5547]]
