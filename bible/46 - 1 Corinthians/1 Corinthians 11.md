1 You are to [[G1096]] imitate [[G3402]] me, [[G1473]] just as [[G2531]] I [imitate] [[G2504]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
2 Now [[G1161]] I commend [[G1867]] you [[G4771]] for [[G3754]] remembering [[G3403]] me [[G1473]] in everything [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] [for] maintaining [[G2722]] the [[G3588]] traditions, [[G3862]] just as [[G2531]] I passed [them] on [[G3860]] to you. [[G4771]] 
3 But [[G1161]] I want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to understand [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] of every [[G3956]] man [[G435]] is [[G1510]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G1161]] [the] head [[G2776]] of [the] woman [[G1135]] [is] man, [[G435]] and [[G1161]] [the] head [[G2776]] of Christ [[G5547]] [is] God. [[G2316]] 
4 Every [[G3956]] man [[G435]] [who] prays [[G4336]] or [[G2228]] prophesies [[G4395]] with [[G2192]] [his] head [[G2776]] covered [[G2596]] dishonors [[G2617]] his [[G846]] head. [[G2776]] 
5 And [[G1161]] every [[G3956]] woman [[G1135]] [who] prays [[G4336]] or [[G2228]] prophesies [[G4395]] with [her] [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] uncovered [[G177]] dishonors [[G2617]] her [[G846]] head, [[G2776]] for [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] just [as if] [[G846]] her head were shaved. [[G3587]] 
6 If [[G1487]] a woman [[G1135]] {does} not [[G3756]] cover her head, [[G2619]] let her hair be cut off. [[G2751]] And [[G1161]] if [it is] [[G1487]] shameful [[G150]] for a woman [[G1135]] to have her hair cut [[G2751]] or [[G2228]] shaved off, [[G3587]] she should cover her head. [[G2619]] 
7 A man [[G435]] ought [[G3784]] not [[G3756]] to cover [[G2619]] [his] [[G3588]] head, [[G2776]] [since] he is [[G5225]] [the] image [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] of God; [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] is [[G1510]] [the] glory [[G1391]] of man. [[G435]] 
8 For [[G1063]] man [[G435]] did not come [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] woman, [[G1135]] but [[G235]] woman [[G1135]] from [[G1537]] man. [[G435]] 
9 Neither [[G2532]] {was} man [[G435]] created [[G2936]] for [[G1223]] woman, [[G1135]] but [[G235]] woman [[G1135]] for [[G1223]] man. [[G435]] 
10 For this reason [[G1223]] a woman [[G1135]] ought [[G3784]] to have [[G2192]] a sign of authority [[G1849]] on [[G1909]] [her] [[G3588]] head, [[G2776]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] angels. [[G32]] 
11 In [[G1722]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] however, [[G4133]] woman [[G1135]] [is] not [[G3777]] independent [[G5565]] [of] man, [[G435]] nor [[G3777]] [is] man [[G435]] independent [[G5565]] of woman. [[G1135]] 
12 For [[G1063]] just as [[G5618]] woman [[G1135]] [came] from [[G1537]] man, [[G435]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] man [[G435]] [is] born of [[G1223]] woman. [[G1135]] But [[G1161]] everything [[G3956]] [comes] from [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]] 
13 Judge [[G2919]] for [[G1722]] yourselves: [[G846]] Is it [[G1510]] proper [[G4241]] for a woman [[G1135]] to pray [[G4336]] to God [[G2316]] with her head uncovered? [[G177]] 
14 Doesn’t [[G3761]] nature [[G5449]] itself [[G846]] teach [[G1321]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] a man [[G435]] has long hair, [[G2863]] it is [[G1510]] a disgrace [[G819]] to him, [[G846]] 
15 but [that] [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] a woman [[G1135]] has long hair, [[G2863]] it is [[G1510]] her [[G846]] glory? [[G1391]] For [[G3754]] long hair [[G2864]] is given [[G1325]] to her [[G846]] as [[G473]] a covering. [[G4018]] 
16 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] is inclined to dispute [this], [[G1380]] we [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] [other] [[G5108]] practice, [[G4914]] nor [[G3761]] [do] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] of God. [[G2316]] 
17 In the [following] [[G3778]] instructions [[G3853]] I have no praise to offer, [[G1867]] because [[G3754]] your gatherings [[G4905]] do more harm [[G2276]] than good. [[G2908]] 
18 First of all, [[G4412]] I hear that [[G191]] [when] you [[G4771]] come together [[G4905]] as [[G1722]] a church, [[G1577]] there are [[G5225]] divisions [[G4978]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] in part [[G3313]] I believe [[G4100]] it. [[G5100]] 
19 And [[G2532]] indeed, [[G1063]] there must [[G1163]] be [[G1510]] differences [[G139]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] to [[G2443]] show [[G5318]] which [[G3588]] of [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] are approved. [[G1384]] 
20 Now then, [[G3767]] [when] you [[G4771]] come together, [[G4905]] it is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] [the] Lord’s [[G2960]] Supper [[G1173]] you eat. [[G5315]] 
21 For [[G1063]] as [[G1722]] you eat, [[G5315]] many [of you] [[G1538]] proceed with [[G4301]] [your] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] meal {to the exclusion of others}. [[G1173]] While [[G3303]] [one] [[G3739]] remains hungry, [[G3983]] [another] [[G3739]] gets drunk. [[G3184]] 
22 Don’t [[G1063]] you have [[G2192]] [your own] [[G3361]] homes [[G3614]] in [[G1519]] which [[G3588]] to eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink? [[G4095]] Or [[G2228]] do you despise [[G2706]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] humiliate [[G2617]] those who [[G3588]] have [[G2192]] nothing? [[G3361]] What [[G5101]] can I say [[G2036]] to you? [[G4771]] Shall I praise [[G1867]] you [[G4771]] for [[G1722]] this? [[G3778]] Of course not! [[G1867]] 
23 For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] received [[G3880]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] what [[G3739]] I also passed on [[G3860]] to you: [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] He was betrayed, [[G3860]] took [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] 
24 and [[G2532]] when He had given thanks, [[G2168]] He broke [it] [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] body, [[G4983]] which [is] [[G3588]] for [[G5228]] you; [[G4771]] do [[G4160]] this [[G3778]] in [[G1519]] remembrance [[G364]] of Me.” [[G1699]] 
25 In the same way, [[G5615]] after [[G3326]] supper [[G1172]] [He took] the [[G3588]] cup, [[G4221]] saying, [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] cup [[G4221]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] covenant [[G1242]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1699]] blood; [[G129]] do [[G4160]] this, [[G3778]] as often as [[G3740]] you drink [it], [[G4095]] in [[G1519]] remembrance [[G364]] of Me. [[G1699]] 
26 For [[G1063]] as often as [[G3740]] you eat [[G2068]] this [[G3778]] bread [[G740]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] [this] [[G3588]] cup, [[G4221]] you proclaim [[G2605]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] death [[G2288]] until [[G891]] He comes. [[G2064]] 
27 Therefore, [[G5620]] whoever [[G3739]] eats [[G2068]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] or [[G2228]] drinks [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] in an unworthy manner [[G371]] will be [[G1510]] guilty of sinning [[G1777]] against the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
28 Each one [[G444]] must examine [[G1381]] himself [[G1438]] [before] [[G2532]] he eats [[G2068]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] and [[G2532]] drinks [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] cup. [[G4221]] 
29 For [[G1063]] anyone who [[G3588]] eats [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinks [[G4095]] without [[G3361]] recognizing [[G1252]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] eats [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinks [[G4095]] judgment [[G2917]] on himself. [[G1438]] 
30 That is why [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] [are] weak [[G772]] and [[G2532]] sick, [[G732]] and [[G2532]] a number [of you] [[G2425]] have fallen asleep. [[G2837]] 
31 Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] we judged [[G1252]] ourselves {properly}, [[G1438]] we would not come under judgment. [[G2919]] 
32 But [[G1161]] when we are judged [[G2919]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] we are being disciplined [[G3811]] so that [[G2443]] we will not be condemned [[G2632]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] 
33 So, [[G5620]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] when you come together [[G4905]] to [[G1519]] eat, [[G5315]] wait for [[G1551]] one another. [[G240]] 
34 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] is hungry, [[G3983]] he should eat [[G2068]] at [[G1722]] home, [[G3624]] so that [[G2443]] when you come together [[G4905]] [it will not result] [[G3361]] in [[G1519]] judgment. [[G2917]] And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] I come, [[G2064]] I will give instructions [[G1299]] about the [[G3588]] remaining matters. [[G3062]]
