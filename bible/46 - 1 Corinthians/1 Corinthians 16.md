1 Now [[G1161]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] collection [[G3048]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] you [[G4771]] are to do [[G4160]] as [[G5618]] I directed [[G1299]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] of Galatia: [[G1053]] 
2 On the first [day] [[G1520]] of every [[G2596]] week, [[G4521]] each [[G1538]] of you [[G4771]] should set [[G5087]] aside [[G3844]] a portion [[G1437]] of his income, [[G2137]] saving it up, [[G2343]] so that [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] I come [[G2064]] no [[G3361]] collections [[G3048]] will be needed. [[G1096]] 
3 Then, [[G1161]] on my arrival, [[G3854]] I will send [[G3992]] letters [[G1992]] with [[G1223]] those [[G3778]] you recommend [[G1381]] to carry [[G667]] your [[G4771]] gift [[G5485]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] 
4 And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] it is [[G1510]] advisable [[G514]] for [[G3588]] me [[G2504]] to go {also}, [[G4198]] they can travel [[G4198]] with [[G4862]] me. [[G1473]] 
5 After [[G3752]] I go through [[G1330]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] however, [[G1161]] I will come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you; [[G4771]] for [[G1063]] I will be going through [[G1330]] Macedonia. [[G3109]] 
6 Perhaps [[G5177]] I will stay [[G3887]] with [[G4314]] you {awhile}, [[G4771]] or [[G2228]] even [[G2532]] spend the winter, [[G3914]] so that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] can help [[G4311]] me {on my journey}, [[G1473]] wherever [[G3757]] I may go. [[G4198]] 
7 For [[G1063]] I do not want [[G2309]] to see [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] now [[G737]] [only] in [[G1722]] passing; [[G3938]] I hope [[G1679]] to spend [[G1961]] some [[G5100]] time [[G5550]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] permits. [[G2010]] 
8 But [[G1161]] I will stay [[G1961]] in [[G1722]] Ephesus [[G2181]] until [[G2193]] Pentecost, [[G4005]] 
9 because [[G1063]] a great [[G3173]] door [[G2374]] [for] [[G2532]] effective [work] [[G1756]] has opened [[G455]] to me, [[G1473]] even though [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] oppose [me]. [[G480]] 
10 If [[G1437]] Timothy [[G5095]] comes, [[G2064]] see to it [[G991]] that [[G2443]] he has [[G1096]] nothing to fear [[G870]] [while he is] with [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] for [[G1063]] he is doing [[G2038]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] work, [[G2041]] just as [[G5613]] I am. [[G2504]] 
11 No [[G3361]] one, [[G5100]] then, [[G3767]] should treat him with contempt. [[G1848]] Send [[G4311]] him {on his way} [[G846]] in [[G1722]] peace [[G1515]] so that [[G2443]] he can return [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me, [[G1473]] for [[G1063]] I am expecting [[G1551]] him [[G846]] along with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]] 
12 Now [[G1161]] about [[G4012]] [our] [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] Apollos: [[G625]] I strongly urged [[G3870]] him [[G846]] to [[G2443]] go [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]] He was [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] at all [[G3843]] inclined [[G2307]] to [[G2443]] go [[G2064]] now, [[G3568]] but [[G1161]] he will go [[G2064]] when [[G3752]] he has the opportunity. [[G2119]] 
13 Be on the alert. [[G1127]] Stand firm [[G4739]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] Be men of courage. [[G407]] Be strong. [[G2901]] 
14 Do [[G1096]] everything [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] love. [[G26]] 
15 You know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] Stephanas [[G4734]] [and his] [[G3588]] household [[G3614]] were [[G1510]] [the] first converts [[G536]] in Achaia, [[G882]] and [[G2532]] they have devoted [[G5021]] themselves [[G1438]] to the [[G1519]] service [[G1248]] of the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]] Now [[G1161]] I urge [[G3870]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] 
16 to [[G2443]] submit [[G5293]] to such as these, [[G5108]] and [[G2532]] to every [[G3956]] fellow worker [[G4903]] and [[G2532]] laborer. [[G2872]] 
17 I am glad that [[G5463]] Stephanas, [[G4734]] Fortunatus, [[G5415]] and [[G2532]] Achaicus [[G883]] have arrived, [[G3952]] because [[G3754]] they [[G3778]] have supplied [[G378]] what [[G3588]] was lacking [[G5303]] from you. [[G5212]] 
18 For [[G1063]] they refreshed [[G373]] my [[G1699]] spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] yours {as well}. [[G4771]] Show your appreciation, [[G1921]] therefore, [[G3767]] to such men. [[G5108]] 
19 The [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] in [the province of] Asia [[G773]] send you greetings. [[G782]] Aquila [[G207]] and [[G2532]] Prisca [[G4251]] greet [[G782]] you [[G4771]] warmly [[G4183]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] and so does [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] [that meets] at [[G2596]] their [[G846]] house. [[G3624]] 
20 All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brothers [here] [[G80]] send you greetings. [[G782]] Greet [[G782]] one another [[G240]] with [[G1722]] a holy [[G40]] kiss. [[G5370]] 
21 This [[G3588]] greeting [[G783]] [is in my] [[G3588]] own [[G1699]] hand— [[G5495]] Paul. [[G3972]] 
22 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] {does} not [[G3756]] love [[G5368]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] let him be [[G1510]] under a divine curse. [[G331]] Come, [[G3134]] O Lord! [[G3134]] 
23 The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] [be] with [[G3326]] you. [[G4771]] 
24 My [[G1473]] love [[G26]] [be] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] of you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] Amen. [[G281]]
