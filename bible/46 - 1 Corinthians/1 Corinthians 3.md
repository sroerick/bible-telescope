# 1 Corinthians 3
[[1 Corinthians 2|←]] • [[1 Corinthians 4|→]]
1 Brothers, [[G80]] I [[G2504]] could not [[G1410]] address [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] as [[G5613]] spiritual, [[G4152]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] worldly— [[G4560]] as [[G5613]] infants [[G3516]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
2 I gave you [[G4222]] milk, [[G1051]] not [[G3756]] solid food, [[G1033]] for [[G1063]] you were not yet ready [for solid food]. [[G1410]] In fact, [[G235]] you are still not ready, [[G1410]] 
3 for [[G1063]] you are [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] worldly. [[G4559]] For [[G1063]] since [there is] [[G3699]] jealousy [[G2205]] and [[G2532]] dissension [[G2054]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] are you [[G1510]] not [[G3780]] worldly? [[G4559]] [ Are you not ] [[G2532]] walking [[G4043]] in the way of [[G2596]] man? [[G444]] 
4 For [[G1063]] when [[G3752]] one [of you] [[G5100]] says, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] [follow] [[G1510]] Paul,” [[G3972]] and [[G1161]] another, [[G2087]] “I [[G1473]] [follow] Apollos,” [[G625]] are you [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] mere men? [[G444]] 
5 What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] is [[G1510]] Apollos? [[G625]] And [[G1161]] what [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] Paul? [[G3972]] [They are] servants [[G1249]] through [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] you believed, [[G4100]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has assigned [[G1325]] to each [ his role ]. [[G1538]] 
6 I [[G1473]] planted [the seed] [[G5452]] [and] Apollos [[G625]] watered [it], [[G4222]] but [[G235]] God [[G2316]] made [ it ] grow. [[G837]] 
7 So [[G5620]] neither [[G3777]] he who [[G3588]] plants [[G5452]] nor [[G3777]] he who [[G3588]] waters [[G4222]] is [[G1510]] anything, [[G5100]] but [only] [[G235]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] makes [things] grow. [[G837]] 
8 He who [[G3588]] plants [[G5452]] and [[G2532]] he who [[G3588]] waters [[G4222]] are [[G1510]] one [ in purpose ], [[G1520]] and [[G1161]] each [[G1538]] will be rewarded [[G2983]] according to [[G2596]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] labor. [[G2873]] 
9 For [[G1063]] we are [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] fellow workers; [[G4904]] you are [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] field, [[G1091]] God’s [[G2316]] building. [[G3619]] 
10 By [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] God [[G2316]] has given [[G1325]] me, [[G1473]] I laid [[G5087]] [a] foundation [[G2310]] as [[G5613]] an expert [[G4680]] builder, [[G753]] and [[G1161]] someone else [[G243]] is building on [it]. [[G2026]] But [[G1161]] each one [[G1538]] must be careful [[G991]] how [[G4459]] he builds. [[G2026]] 
11 For [[G1063]] no one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] lay [[G5087]] a [[G243]] foundation [[G2310]] other than [[G3844]] the [one] [[G3588]] already laid, [[G2749]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
12 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] builds [[G2026]] on [[G1909]] [this] [[G3588]] foundation [[G2310]] [using] gold, [[G5557]] silver, [[G696]] precious [[G5093]] stones, [[G3037]] wood, [[G3586]] hay, [[G5528]] [or] straw, [[G2562]] 
13 his [[G1538]] workmanship [[G2041]] will be [[G1096]] evident, [[G5318]] because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Day [[G2250]] will bring it to light. [[G1213]] It will be revealed [[G601]] with [[G1722]] fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] will prove [[G1381]] the quality [[G3697]] of each [[G1538]] [man’s] [[G3588]] work. [[G2041]] 
14 If [[G1487]] what he has built [[G2026]] survives, [[G3306]] he will receive [[G2983]] a reward. [[G3408]] 
15 If [[G1487]] [it] [[G5100]] is burned up, [[G2618]] he will suffer loss. [[G2210]] He himself [[G846]] will be saved, [[G4982]] but only [[G1161]] as if [[G5613]] through [[G1223]] [the] flames. [[G4442]] 
16 Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you yourselves are [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] temple, [[G3485]] and that [[G2532]] God’s [[G2316]] Spirit [[G4151]] dwells [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] you? [[G4771]] 
17 If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] destroys [[G5351]] God’s [[G2316]] temple, [[G3485]] God [[G2316]] will destroy [[G5351]] him; [[G3778]] for [[G1063]] God’s [[G2316]] temple [[G3485]] is [[G1510]] holy, [[G40]] [and] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] [that temple]. [[G3748]] 
18 {Let} no one [[G3367]] deceive [[G1818]] himself. [[G1438]] If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] of [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] thinks [[G1380]] he is [[G1510]] wise [[G4680]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] age, [[G165]] he should become [[G1096]] a fool, [[G3474]] so that [[G2443]] he may become [[G1096]] wise. [[G4680]] 
19 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of this [[G3778]] world [[G2889]] is [[G1510]] foolishness [[G3472]] in God’s sight. [[G3844]] [As] [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] “He [[G3588]] catches [[G1405]] the [[G3588]] wise [[G4680]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] craftiness.” [[G3834]] 
20 And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] “[The] Lord [[G2962]] knows [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] thoughts [[G1261]] of the [[G3588]] wise [[G4680]] are [[G1510]] futile.” [[G3152]] 
21 Therefore [[G5620]] stop [[G3367]] boasting [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] men. [[G444]] All things [[G3956]] are [[G1510]] yours, [[G4771]] 
22 whether [[G1535]] Paul [[G3972]] or [[G1535]] Apollos [[G625]] or [[G1535]] Cephas [[G2786]] or [[G1535]] [the] world [[G2889]] or [[G1535]] life [[G2222]] or [[G1535]] death [[G2288]] or [[G1535]] the present [[G1764]] or [[G1535]] the future. [[G3195]] All [of them] [[G3956]] [belong to] you, [[G4771]] 
23 and [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] [belong to] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G1161]] Christ [[G5547]] [belongs to] God. [[G2316]]
