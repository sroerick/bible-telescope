1 Now, [[G1161]] brothers, [[G80]] I want to remind [[G1107]] you [[G4771]] [of] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] I preached [[G2097]] to you, [[G4771]] which [[G3739]] you received, [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] you stand firm. [[G2476]] 
2 By [[G1223]] [this gospel] [[G3739]] you are saved, [[G4982]] if [[G1487]] you hold firmly [[G2722]] to the [[G5101]] word [[G3056]] I preached [[G2097]] to you. [[G4771]] Otherwise, [[G1622]] you have believed [[G4100]] in vain. [[G1500]] 
3 For [[G1063]] what [[G3739]] I received [[G3880]] I passed on [[G3860]] to you [[G4771]] as of [[G1722]] first importance: [[G4413]] that [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] our [[G1473]] sins [[G266]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures, [[G1124]] 
4 that [[G3754]] He was buried, [[G2290]] that [[G3754]] He was raised [[G1453]] on the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures, [[G1124]] 
5 and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] He appeared [[G3708]] to Cephas [[G2786]] [and] then [[G1534]] to the [[G3588]] Twelve. [[G1427]] 
6 After that, [[G1899]] He appeared [[G3708]] to more than [[G1883]] five hundred [[G4001]] brothers [[G80]] at once, [[G2178]] most [[G4119]] of [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] are still alive, [[G3306]] though [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] have fallen asleep. [[G2837]] 
7 Then [[G1899]] He appeared [[G3708]] to James, [[G2385]] then [[G1534]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] apostles. [[G652]] 
8 And [[G1161]] last [[G2078]] of all [[G3956]] He appeared [[G3708]] to me also, [[G2504]] as [[G5619]] to [one] [[G3588]] of untimely birth. [[G1626]] 
9 For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] least [[G1646]] of the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] [and] [[G3739]] am [[G1510]] unworthy [[G2425]] to be called [[G2564]] an apostle, [[G652]] because [[G1360]] I persecuted [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of God. [[G2316]] 
10 But [[G1161]] [by the] grace [[G5485]] of God [[G2316]] I am [[G1510]] what [[G3739]] I am, [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] grace [[G5485]] to [[G1519]] me [[G1473]] was not [[G1096]] in vain. [[G2756]] No, [[G235]] I worked [[G2872]] harder [[G4053]] than all of them— [[G846]] yet [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] I, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of God [[G2316]] that [was] [[G3588]] with [[G4862]] me. [[G1473]] 
11 Whether, [[G1535]] then, [[G3767]] [it was] I [[G1473]] or [[G1535]] they, [[G1565]] this is what [[G3779]] we preach, [[G2784]] and [[G2532]] this is what [[G3779]] you believed. [[G4100]] 
12 But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] it is preached [[G2784]] that [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] has been raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] how [[G4459]] {can} some [[G5100]] of [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] resurrection [[G386]] of [the] dead? [[G3498]] 
13 If [[G1487]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] resurrection [[G386]] of [the] dead, [[G3498]] [then] not even [[G3761]] Christ [[G5547]] has been raised. [[G1453]] 
14 And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] Christ [[G5547]] has not been raised, [[G1453]] our [[G1473]] preaching [[G2782]] [is] worthless, [[G2756]] and [[G2532]] [so is] [[G2756]] your [[G4771]] faith. [[G4102]] 
15 In that case, [[G1161]] we are also exposed as [[G2147]] false witnesses [[G5575]] about God. [[G2316]] For [[G3754]] we have testified [[G3140]] about [[G2596]] God [[G2316]] that [[G3754]] He raised [[G1453]] Christ {from the dead}, [[G5547]] [but] He did not raise [[G1453]] [Him] [[G3739]] if [[G1512]] in fact [[G686]] [the] dead [[G3498]] are not raised. [[G1453]] 
16 For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] [the] dead [[G3498]] are not raised, [[G1453]] then not even [[G3761]] Christ [[G5547]] has been raised. [[G1453]] 
17 And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] Christ [[G5547]] has not been raised, [[G1453]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] is [[G1510]] futile; [[G3152]] you are [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] sins. [[G266]] 
18 Then [[G686]] those [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] {who} have fallen asleep [[G2837]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] have perished. [[G622]] 
19 If [[G1487]] our [[G1510]] hope [[G1679]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] [is] for [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] life [[G2222]] alone, [[G3440]] we are [[G1510]] to be pitied more [[G1652]] than all [[G3956]] men. [[G444]] 
20 But [[G1161]] Christ [[G5547]] {has} indeed [[G3570]] been raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] [the] firstfruits [[G536]] of those who [[G3588]] have fallen asleep. [[G2837]] 
21 For [[G1063]] since [[G1894]] death [[G2288]] [came] through [[G1223]] a man, [[G444]] [the] resurrection [[G386]] of [the] dead [[G3498]] [comes] also [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] a man. [[G444]] 
22 For as [[G5618]] in [[G1722]] Adam [[G76]] all [[G3956]] die, [[G599]] so [[G3779]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] all [[G3956]] will be made alive. [[G2227]] 
23 But [[G1161]] each [[G1538]] in [[G1722]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] turn: [[G5001]] Christ [[G5547]] [the] firstfruits; [[G536]] then [[G1899]] at [[G1722]] His [[G846]] coming, [[G3952]] those [[G3588]] who belong to [[G3588]] [Him]. [[G5547]] 
24 Then [[G1534]] the [[G3588]] end [will come], [[G5056]] when [[G3752]] He hands over [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] to God [[G2316]] [the] [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] after [[G3752]] He has destroyed [[G2673]] all [[G3956]] dominion, [[G746]] authority, [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] power. [[G1411]] 
25 For [[G1063]] He [[G846]] must [[G1163]] reign [[G936]] until [[G891]] He has put [[G5087]] all [[G3956]] [His] [[G3588]] enemies [[G2190]] under [[G5259]] His [[G846]] feet. [[G4228]] 
26 [The] last [[G2078]] enemy [[G2190]] to be destroyed [is] [[G2673]] death. [[G2288]] 
27 For [[G1063]] “[God] has put [[G5293]] everything [[G3956]] under [[G5259]] His [[G846]] feet.” [[G4228]] Now [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] it says [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] everything [[G3956]] has been put under Him, [[G5293]] this [[G3754]] clearly [[G1212]] [does] not include [[G1622]] the [One who] [[G3588]] put everything under [[G5293]] Him. [[G846]] 
28 And [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] all things [[G3956]] have been subjected to [[G5293]] Him, [[G846]] then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] Himself [[G846]] will be made subject [[G5293]] to Him who [[G3588]] put [[G5293]] all things [[G3956]] {under} Him, [[G846]] so that [[G2443]] God [[G2316]] may be [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] all. [[G3956]] 
29 If [these things are] not so, [[G1893]] what [[G5101]] will those do [[G4160]] who [[G3588]] are baptized [[G907]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] dead? [[G3498]] If [[G1487]] [the] dead [[G3498]] are not raised [[G1453]] at all, [[G3654]] why [[G5101]] are [people] baptized [[G907]] for [[G5228]] them? [[G846]] 
30 And [[G2532]] why [[G5101]] {do} we [[G1473]] endanger ourselves [[G2793]] every [[G3956]] hour? [[G5610]] 
31 I face death [[G599]] every [[G2596]] day, [[G2250]] brothers, [[G80]] as surely as [[G3513]] I boast [[G2746]] about you [[G5212]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
32 If [[G1487]] I fought wild beasts [[G2341]] in [[G1722]] Ephesus [[G2181]] for [[G2596]] human [motives], [[G444]] what [[G5101]] did I gain? [[G3786]] If [[G1487]] [the] dead [[G3498]] are not raised, [[G1453]] “Let us eat [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] drink, [[G4095]] for [[G1063]] tomorrow [[G839]] we die.” [[G599]] 
33 {Do} not [[G3361]] be deceived: [[G4105]] “Bad [[G2556]] company [[G3657]] corrupts [[G5351]] good [[G5543]] character.” [[G2239]] 
34 Sober up [[G1594]] as you ought, [[G1346]] and [[G2532]] stop sinning; [[G264]] for [[G1063]] some [ of you ] [[G5100]] are ignorant [[G56]] of God. [[G2316]] I say this [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] your [[G4771]] shame. [[G1791]] 
35 But [[G235]] someone [[G5100]] will ask, [[G2046]] “How [[G4459]] {are} the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] raised? [[G1453]] With what kind [[G4169]] of body [[G4983]] will they come?” [[G2064]] 
36 You [[G4771]] fool! [[G878]] What [[G3739]] you sow [[G4687]] does not come to life [[G2227]] unless [[G1437]] it dies. [[G599]] 
37 And [[G2532]] what [[G3739]] you sow [[G4687]] [is] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] that [[G3588]] will be, [[G1096]] but [[G235]] [just] [[G4687]] a seed, [[G2848]] perhaps [[G1487]] of wheat [[G4621]] or [[G2228]] something [[G5100]] else. [[G3062]] 
38 But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] gives [[G1325]] it [[G846]] a body [[G4983]] as [[G2531]] He has designed, [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] to each [kind] [[G1538]] of [[G3588]] seed [[G4690]] [He gives] its own [[G2398]] body. [[G4983]] 
39 Not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] flesh [is] [[G4561]] the [[G3588]] same: [[G846]] Men [have] [[G444]] one [kind of] [[G243]] flesh, [[G4561]] animals [have] [[G2934]] another, [[G243]] birds [[G4421]] another, [[G243]] and [[G1161]] fish [[G2486]] another. [[G243]] 
40 [There are] also [[G2532]] heavenly [[G2032]] bodies [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] earthly [[G1919]] bodies. [[G4983]] But [[G235]] the [[G3588]] splendor [[G1391]] of the [[G3588]] heavenly [bodies] [[G2032]] [is of] one [degree], [[G2087]] and [[G1161]] [the splendor] [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] earthly [bodies] [[G1919]] [is of] another. [[G2087]] 
41 [The] sun [[G2246]] [has] one [[G243]] [degree of] splendor, [[G1391]] [the] moon [[G4582]] another, [[G243]] and [[G2532]] [the] stars [[G792]] another; [[G243]] and [[G1063]] star [[G792]] differs [[G1308]] from star [[G792]] in [[G1722]] splendor. [[G1391]] 
42 So [[G3779]] [will it be] [[G2532]] with the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] of the [[G3588]] dead: [[G3498]] What is sown [is] [[G4687]] perishable; [[G5356]] it is raised [[G1453]] imperishable. [[G861]] 
43 It is sown [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] dishonor; [[G819]] it is raised [[G1453]] in [[G1722]] glory. [[G1391]] It is sown [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] weakness; [[G769]] it is raised [[G1453]] in [[G1722]] power. [[G1411]] 
44 It is sown [[G4687]] a natural [[G5591]] body; [[G4983]] it is raised [[G1453]] a spiritual [[G4152]] body. [[G4983]] If [[G1487]] there is [[G1510]] a natural [[G5591]] body, [[G4983]] there is [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] a spiritual [body]. [[G4152]] 
45 So [[G3779]] it is written: [[G1125]] “The [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] man [[G444]] Adam [[G76]] became [[G1096]] a living [[G2198]] being;” [[G5590]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] Adam [[G76]] a life-giving [[G2227]] spirit. [[G4151]] 
46 The [[G3588]] spiritual, [[G4152]] however, [[G235]] [was] not [[G3756]] first, [[G4412]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] natural, [[G5591]] and then [[G1899]] the [[G3588]] spiritual. [[G4152]] 
47 The [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] man [[G444]] [was] of the dust [[G5517]] of [[G1537]] [the] earth, [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] man [[G444]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
48 As [[G3634]] [was] the [[G3588]] earthly [man], [[G5517]] so [[G5108]] also [are] [[G2532]] those who are [[G3588]] of the earth; [[G5517]] and [[G2532]] as [[G3634]] [is] the [[G3588]] heavenly [man], [[G2032]] so [[G5108]] also [[G2532]] [are] those who are [[G3588]] of heaven. [[G2032]] 
49 And [[G2532]] just as [[G2531]] we have borne [[G5409]] the [[G3588]] likeness [[G1504]] of the [[G3588]] earthly [man], [[G5517]] so also [[G2532]] shall we bear [[G5409]] the [[G3588]] likeness [[G1504]] of the [[G3588]] heavenly [man]. [[G2032]] 
50 Now [[G1161]] I declare [to you], [[G5346]] brothers, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood [[G129]] cannot [[G1410]] inherit [[G2816]] [the] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]] nor [[G3761]] {does} the [[G3588]] perishable [[G5356]] inherit [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] imperishable. [[G861]] 
51 Listen, [[G2400]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] a mystery: [[G3466]] {We will} not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] sleep, [[G2837]] but [[G1161]] we will all be changed— [[G236]] 
52 in [[G1722]] an instant, [[G823]] in [[G1722]] [the] twinkling [[G4493]] of an eye, [[G3788]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] trumpet. [[G4536]] For [[G1063]] the trumpet will sound, [[G4537]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] will be raised [[G1453]] imperishable, [[G862]] and [[G2532]] we [[G1473]] will be changed. [[G236]] 
53 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] perishable [[G5349]] must [[G1163]] be clothed with [[G1746]] [the] imperishable, [[G861]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mortal [[G2349]] [with] [[G1746]] immortality. [[G110]] 
54 When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] perishable [[G5349]] has been clothed with [[G1746]] the [[G3588]] imperishable [[G861]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mortal [[G2349]] [with] [[G1746]] immortality, [[G110]] then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G3056]] that [[G3588]] is written [[G1125]] will come to pass: [[G1096]] “Death [[G2288]] has been swallowed up [[G2666]] in [[G1519]] victory. [[G3534]] 
55 “Where, [[G4226]] O death, [[G2288]] [is] your [[G4771]] victory? [[G3534]] Where, [[G4226]] O death, [[G2288]] [is] your [[G4771]] sting?” [[G2759]] 
56 The [[G3588]] sting [[G2759]] of death [is] [[G2288]] sin, [[G266]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of sin [[G266]] [is] the [[G3588]] Law. [[G3551]] 
57 But [[G1161]] thanks [[G5485]] [be] to [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] gives [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] victory [[G3534]] through [[G1223]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ! [[G5547]] 
58 Therefore, [[G5620]] my [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] brothers, [[G80]] be [[G1096]] steadfast [[G1476]] [and] immovable. [[G277]] Always [[G3842]] excel [[G4052]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] of the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] because you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] your [[G4771]] labor [[G2873]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] in vain. [[G2756]]
