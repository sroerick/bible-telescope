1 Paul, [[G3972]] Silvanus, [[G4610]] and [[G2532]] Timothy, [[G5095]] To the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of [the] Thessalonians [[G2331]] in [[G1722]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]] 
2 Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
3 We are obligated [[G3784]] to thank [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] for [[G4012]] you [[G4771]] all the time, [[G3842]] brothers, [[G80]] as [[G2531]] is [[G1510]] fitting, [[G514]] because [[G3754]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] is growing more and more, [[G5232]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] love [[G26]] for [[G1519]] one another [[G240]] is increasing. [[G4121]] 
4 That is why [[G5620]] we [[G1473]] boast [[G2744]] among [[G1722]] God’s [[G2316]] churches [[G1577]] about [[G5228]] your [[G4771]] perseverance [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] faith [[G4102]] in the face of [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] [the] [[G4771]] persecution [[G1375]] and [[G2532]] affliction [[G2347]] you are enduring. [[G430]] 
5 [ All this is ] clear evidence [[G1730]] of God’s [[G2316]] righteous [[G1342]] judgment. [[G2920]] And so [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] will be counted worthy [[G2661]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] which [[G3739]] you are suffering. [[G3958]] 
6 After all, [[G1512]] [it is] only right [[G1342]] for [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] to repay [[G467]] with affliction [[G2347]] those who [[G3588]] afflict [[G2346]] you, [[G4771]] 
7 and [[G2532]] to grant relief [[G425]] to you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] are oppressed [[G2346]] and [[G3326]] to us [as well], [[G1473]] [when] [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] is revealed [[G602]] from [[G575]] heaven [[G3772]] with [[G3326]] His [[G846]] mighty [[G1411]] angels [[G32]] 
8 in [[G1722]] blazing [[G5395]] fire. [[G4442]] He will inflict [[G1325]] vengeance [[G1557]] on those who [[G3588]] do not know [[G1492]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] do not obey [[G5219]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
9 [They] [[G3748]] will suffer [[G5099]] [the] penalty [[G1349]] of eternal [[G166]] destruction, [[G3639]] separated from [[G575]] [the] presence [[G4383]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] might, [[G2479]] 
10 on [[G1722]] [the] [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] He comes [[G2064]] to be glorified [[G1740]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] regarded with wonder [[G2296]] by [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] have believed, [[G4100]] including [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] who have believed [[G4100]] our [[G1473]] testimony. [[G3142]] 
11 To this end, [[G1519]] we always pray [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] you, [[G4771]] that [[G2443]] our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] will count you worthy [[G515]] of [His] [[G3588]] calling, [[G2821]] and [that] [[G2532]] He will powerfully fulfill [[G4137]] [your] every [[G3956]] good [[G19]] desire [[G2107]] and [[G2532]] work [[G2041]] of faith, [[G4102]] 
12 so that [[G3704]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] will be glorified [[G1740]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] Him, [[G846]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ.
