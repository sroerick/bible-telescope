1 Finally, [[G3063]] brothers, [[G80]] pray [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] us, [[G1473]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] may spread quickly [[G5143]] and [[G2532]] be held in honor, [[G1392]] just as [[G2531]] [it was] [[G2532]] with [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]] 
2 And [pray] [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] we may be delivered [[G4506]] from [[G575]] wicked [[G824]] and [[G2532]] evil [[G4190]] men; [[G444]] for [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] everyone [ holds to ] [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] 
3 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G1510]] faithful, [[G4103]] [and He] [[G3739]] will strengthen [you] [[G4741]] and [[G2532]] guard [[G5442]] you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] evil [one]. [[G4190]] 
4 And [[G1161]] we have confidence [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] that [[G3754]] you are doing [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] will continue to do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] we command. [[G3853]] 
5 {May} the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] direct [[G2720]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] into [[G1519]] God’s [[G2316]] love [[G26]] and [[G2532]] Christ’s [[G5547]] perseverance. [[G5281]] 
6 Now [[G1161]] we command [[G3853]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] in [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] to keep away [[G4724]] from [[G575]] any [[G3956]] brother [[G80]] [who] leads [[G4043]] an undisciplined life [[G814]] [that is] [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] in keeping with [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] you received [[G3880]] from [[G3844]] us. [[G1473]] 
7 For [[G1063]] you yourselves [[G846]] know [[G1492]] how [[G4459]] you ought [[G1163]] to imitate [[G3401]] us, [[G1473]] because [[G3754]] we were not undisciplined [[G812]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] 
8 nor [[G3761]] did we eat [[G5315]] anyone’s [[G5100]] food [[G740]] without paying for it. [[G1432]] Instead, [[G235]] in [[G1722]] labor [[G2873]] and [[G2532]] toil, [[G3449]] we worked [[G2038]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] so that [[G4314]] we would not be a burden [[G1912]] to any [[G5100]] of you. [[G4771]] 
9 Not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] we lack [[G2192]] [this] right, [[G1849]] but [[G235]] we wanted to [[G2443]] offer [[G1325]] ourselves [[G1438]] [as] an example [[G5179]] for you [[G4771]] to [[G1519]] imitate. [[G3401]] 
10 For [[G1063]] even [[G2532]] while [[G3753]] we were [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] we gave you this command: [[G3853]] “If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] is unwilling [[G2309]] to work, [[G2038]] he shall not eat.” [[G2068]] 
11 Yet [[G1063]] we hear that [[G191]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] are leading [[G4043]] undisciplined lives [[G814]] [and] accomplishing [[G2038]] nothing [[G3367]] but [[G235]] being busybodies. [[G4020]] 
12 We command [[G3853]] and [[G2532]] urge [[G3870]] such [people] [[G5108]] by [[G1722]] our Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] to [[G2443]] begin working [[G2038]] quietly [[G2271]] to earn their own living. [[G2068]] 
13 But [as for] [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] {do} not [[G3361]] grow weary [[G1573]] [in] well-doing. [[G2569]] 
14 Take note [[G4593]] of [[G3778]] anyone who [[G5100]] {does} not [[G3756]] obey [[G5219]] the [[G3588]] instructions we have given [[G3056]] in [[G1223]] [this] [[G3588]] letter. [[G1992]] {Do} not [[G3361]] associate with [[G4874]] him, [[G846]] so that [[G2443]] he may be ashamed. [[G1788]] 
15 Yet [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] regard [him] [[G2233]] as [[G5613]] an enemy, [[G2190]] but [[G235]] warn [him] [[G3560]] as [[G5613]] a brother. [[G80]] 
16 Now [[G1161]] {may} the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] of peace [[G1515]] Himself [[G846]] give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] peace [[G1515]] at [[G1223]] all [times] [[G3956]] [and] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] way. [[G5158]] The [[G3588]] Lord [be] [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] of you. [[G4771]] 
17 [This] [[G3588]] greeting [is] [[G783]] in my own [[G1699]] hand— [[G5495]] Paul. [[G3972]] This [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [my] mark [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] letter; [[G1992]] it is the way [[G3779]] I write. [[G1125]] 
18 The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [be] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] of you. [[G4771]]
