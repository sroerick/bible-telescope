1 Now [[G1161]] concerning [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] gathering together [[G1997]] to [[G1909]] Him, [[G846]] we ask [[G2065]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] 
2 not [[G3361]] to be easily disconcerted [[G4531]] [or] [[G3366]] alarmed [[G2360]] by [[G1223]] [any] spirit [[G4151]] [or] [[G3383]] message [[G3056]] [or] [[G3383]] letter [[G1992]] presuming [[G5613]] [to be] from [[G1223]] us [[G1473]] [and alleging] [[G5613]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has already come. [[G1764]] 
3 {Let} no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] deceive [[G1818]] you [[G4771]] in [[G2596]] [any] [[G3367]] way, [[G5158]] for [ it will not come ] [[G3754]] until [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] rebellion [[G646]] occurs [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] of lawlessness [[G458]] (the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of destruction) [[G684]] is revealed. [[G601]] 
4 [He] [[G3588]] will oppose [[G480]] and [[G2532]] exalt himself [[G5229]] above [[G1909]] every [[G3956]] so-called [[G3004]] god [[G2316]] or [[G2228]] object of worship. [[G4574]] So [[G5620]] he [[G846]] will seat himself [[G2523]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of God, [[G2316]] proclaiming himself [[G584]] to be [[G1510]] God. [[G2316]] 
5 Do you not remember [[G3421]] that [[G3754]] I told [[G2036]] you [[G4771]] these things [[G3778]] while I was [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] with [[G4314]] you? [[G4771]] 
6 And [[G2532]] you know [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] is now restraining [[G2722]] him, [[G846]] so that [[G1519]] he will be revealed [[G601]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] proper time. [[G2540]] 
7 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of lawlessness [[G458]] {is} already [[G2235]] at work, [[G1754]] but [[G3440]] the [one who] [[G3588]] now [[G737]] restrains [it] [[G2722]] [will continue] until [[G2193]] he is taken [[G1096]] out of [[G1537]] [the] way. [[G3319]] 
8 And [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] lawless [one] [[G459]] will be revealed, [[G601]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] will slay [[G337]] with the [[G3588]] breath [[G4151]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] abolish [[G2673]] by the [[G3588]] majesty [[G2015]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] arrival. [[G3952]] 
9 The [[G3588]] coming [of the lawless one] [[G3952]] will be [[G1510]] accompanied by [[G2596]] [the] working [[G1753]] of Satan, [[G4567]] with [[G1722]] every kind of [[G3956]] power, [[G1411]] sign, [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] FALSE [[G5579]] wonder, [[G5059]] 
10 and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] wicked [[G93]] deception [[G539]] directed against those who [[G3588]] are perishing, [[G622]] because [[G473]] they refused [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] that would have [[G1519]] saved [[G4982]] them. [[G846]] 
11 For this reason, [[G1223]] God [[G2316]] will send [[G3992]] them [[G846]] a powerful [[G1753]] delusion [[G4106]] so that [[G1519]] they [[G846]] will believe [[G4100]] [the] lie, [[G5579]] 
12 in order that [[G2443]] judgment will come upon [[G2919]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] have disbelieved [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] [and] [[G235]] delighted [[G2106]] in wickedness. [[G93]] 
13 But [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] should [[G3784]] always [[G3842]] thank [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] for [[G4012]] you, [[G4771]] brothers [[G80]] who are loved [[G25]] by [[G5259]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] because [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] has chosen [[G138]] you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning [[G746]] to [[G1519]] be saved [[G4991]] by [[G1722]] [the] sanctification [[G38]] of [the] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] [by] faith [[G4102]] in [the] truth. [[G225]] 
14 To [[G1519]] this [[G3739]] He called [[G2564]] you [[G4771]] through [[G1223]] our [[G1473]] gospel, [[G2098]] so that [[G1519]] you may share in [[G4047]] [the] glory [[G1391]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
15 Therefore, [[G686]] brothers, [[G80]] stand firm [[G4739]] and [[G2532]] cling [[G2902]] to the [[G3588]] traditions [[G3862]] we [[G1473]] taught you, [[G1321]] whether [[G1535]] by [[G1223]] speech [[G3056]] or [[G1535]] by [[G1223]] letter. [[G1992]] 
16 Now {may} [[G1161]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] Himself, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] by [[G1722]] grace [[G5485]] has loved [[G25]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] given [us] [[G1325]] eternal [[G166]] comfort [[G3874]] and [[G2532]] good [[G18]] hope, [[G1680]] 
17 encourage [[G3870]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] strengthen [you] [[G4741]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] deed. [[G2041]]
