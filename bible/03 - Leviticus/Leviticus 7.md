1 Now this [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of the guilt offering, [[H817]] which [is] [[H1931]] most [[H6944]] holy: [[H6944]] 
2 The guilt offering [[H817]] must be slaughtered [[H7819]] in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] is slaughtered, [[H7819]] and [the priest] shall sprinkle [[H2236]] its blood [[H1818]] on all sides [[H5439]] of [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
3 And [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] from [[H4480]] it [[H853]] shall be offered: [[H7126]] the fat tail, [[H451]] the fat [[H2459]] that covers [[H3680]] the entrails, [[H7130]] 
4 both [[H8147]] kidneys [[H3629]] with the fat [[H2459]] on them [[H5921]] near [[H5921]] the loins, [[H3689]] and the lobe [[H3508]] of [[H5921]] the liver, [[H3516]] which is to be removed [[H5493]] with [[H5921]] the kidneys. [[H3629]] 
5 The priest [[H3548]] shall burn [[H6999]] them [[H853]] on the altar [[H4196]] as an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] it [[H1931]] is a guilt offering. [[H817]] 
6 Every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] among the priests [[H3548]] may eat of it. [[H398]] It must be eaten [[H398]] in a holy [[H6918]] place; [[H4725]] it [is] [[H1931]] most [[H6944]] holy. [[H6944]] 
7 The guilt offering [[H817]] is like the sin offering; [[H2403]] the same [[H259]] law [[H8451]] applies to both.  It belongs to [[H1961]] the priest [[H3548]] who [[H834]] makes atonement with it. [[H3722]] 
8 As for the priest [[H3548]] who presents [[H7126]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] for anyone, [[H376]] the hide [[H5785]] of [that] offering [[H5930]] belongs to him.  
9 Likewise, every [[H3605]] grain offering [[H4503]] that [[H834]] is baked [[H644]] in an oven [[H8574]] or cooked [[H6213]] in a pan [[H4802]] or on [[H5921]] a griddle [[H4227]] belongs [[H1961]] to  the priest [[H3548]] who presents [[H7126]] it, [[H853]] 
10 and every [[H3605]] grain offering, [[H4503]] whether dry [[H2720]] or mixed [[H1101]] with oil, [[H8081]] belongs equally [[H376]] to [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron. [[H175]] 
11 Now this [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of the peace offering [[H8002]] that [[H834]] one may present [[H7126]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] 
12 If [[H518]] he offers it [[H7126]] as [[H5921]] a thanksgiving, [[H8426]] then along with [[H5921]] the sacrifice [[H2077]] of thanksgiving, [[H8426]] he must offer [[H7126]] unleavened [[H4682]] cakes [[H2471]] mixed [[H1101]] with olive oil, [[H8081]] unleavened [[H4682]] wafers [[H7550]] coated [[H4886]] with oil, [[H8081]] and well-kneaded [[H7246]] cakes [[H2471]] of fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with oil. [[H8081]] 
13 Along [[H5921]] with [[H5921]] his peace offering [[H8002]] of thanksgiving, [[H8426]] he is to present [[H7126]] an offering [[H7133]] with cakes [[H2471]] of leavened [[H2557]] bread. [[H3899]] 
14 From [[H4480]] the cakes he must present [[H7126]] one [[H259]] portion of each [[H3605]] offering [[H7133]] as a contribution [[H8641]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] It belongs [[H1961]] to  the priest [[H3548]] who sprinkles [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] of the peace offering. [[H8002]] 
15 The meat [[H1320]] of the sacrifice [[H2077]] of his thanksgiving [[H8426]] peace offering [[H8002]] must be eaten [[H398]] on the day [[H3117]] he offers it; [[H7133]] none [[H3808]] of it [[H4480]] may be left [[H3240]] until [[H5704]] morning. [[H1242]] 
16 If, however, [[H518]] the sacrifice [[H2077]] he offers [[H7133]] is a vow [[H5088]] or [[H176]] a freewill offering, [[H5071]] it shall be eaten [[H398]] on the day [[H3117]] he presents [[H7126]] his sacrifice, [[H2077]] but the remainder [[H3498]] may be eaten [[H398]] on [[H4480]] the next day. [[H4283]] 
17 But any meat [[H1320]] of the sacrifice [[H2077]] remaining [[H3498]] until the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] must be burned up. [[H8313]] 
18 If [[H518]] any of [[H4480]] the meat [[H1320]] from his peace offering [[H8002]] is eaten [[H398]] on the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] it will not [[H3808]] be accepted. [[H7521]] It will not [[H3808]] be credited [[H2803]] to  the one who presented it; [[H7126]] it shall be [[H1961]] an abomination, [[H6292]] and the one [[H5315]] who eats of it [[H398]] shall bear [[H5375]] his iniquity. [[H5771]] 
19 Meat [[H1320]] that [[H834]] touches [[H5060]] anything [[H3605]] unclean [[H2931]] must not [[H3808]] be eaten; [[H398]] it is to be burned up. [[H8313]] As for [[H1320]] any other meat, [[H1320]] anyone [[H3605]] who is clean [[H2889]] may eat it. [[H398]] 
20 But if anyone [[H5315]] who [[H834]] is unclean [[H2932]] eats [[H398]] meat [[H1320]] from the peace offering [[H8002]] that [[H834]] belongs to the LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H1931]] person [[H5315]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from his people. [[H5971]] 
21 If [[H3588]] one [[H5315]] touches [[H5060]] anything [[H3605]] unclean, [[H2931]] whether [[H176]] human [[H120]] uncleanness, [[H2932]] an unclean [[H2931]] animal, [[H929]] or [[H176]] any [[H3605]] unclean, [[H2931]] detestable thing, [[H8263]] and then eats [[H398]] any of the meat [[H1320]] of the peace offering [[H8002]] that [[H834]] belongs to the LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H1931]] person [[H5315]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from his people. [[H5971]] 
22 Then the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
23 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] [and] say, [[H559]] ‘You are not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] of the fat [[H2459]] of an ox, [[H7794]] a sheep, [[H3775]] or a goat. [[H5795]] 
24 The fat [[H2459]] of an animal found dead [[H5038]] or mauled by wild beasts [[H2966]] may be used [[H6213]] for any other [[H3605]] purpose, [[H4399]] but you must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] it. [[H398]] 
25 If [[H3588]] anyone [[H3605]] eats [[H398]] animal [[H929]] fat [[H2459]] from which [[H4480]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] may be presented [[H7126]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the one [[H5315]] who eats [[H398]] it must be cut off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] his people. [[H5971]] 
26 You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the blood [[H1818]] of any [[H3605]] bird [[H5775]] or animal [[H929]] in any [[H3605]] of your dwellings. [[H4186]] 
27 If anyone [[H3605]] eats [[H398]] blood, [[H1818]] that [[H1931]] person [[H5315]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from his people.’” [[H5971]] 
28 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
29 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] [and] say, [[H559]] ‘Anyone who presents [[H7126]] a peace offering [[H8002]] to the LORD [[H3068]] must bring [[H935]] [it] [[H7133]] as his sacrifice [[H2077]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
30 With his own hands [[H3027]] he is to bring [[H935]] the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] he shall bring [[H935]] the fat, [[H2459]] together with [[H5921]] the breast, [[H2373]] and wave [[H5130]] the breast [[H2373]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
31 The priest [[H3548]] is to burn [[H6999]] the fat [[H2459]] on the altar, [[H4196]] but the breast [[H2373]] belongs to [[H1961]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons. [[H1121]] 
32 And [[H853]] you are to give [[H5414]] the right [[H3225]] thigh [[H7785]] to the priest [[H3548]] as a contribution [[H8641]] from your peace offering. [[H8002]] 
33 The son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] who presents [[H7126]] the blood [[H1818]] and [[H853]] fat [[H2459]] of the peace offering [[H8002]] shall have [[H1961]] the right [[H3225]] thigh [[H7785]] as a portion. [[H4490]] 
34 I have taken [[H3947]] from the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] the breast [[H2373]] of the wave offering [[H8573]] and the thigh [[H7785]] of the contribution [[H8641]] of their peace offerings, [[H8002]] and I have given [[H5414]] them to Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] and his sons [[H1121]] as a permanent [[H5769]] portion [[H2706]] from the sons [[H1121]] of Israel.’” [[H3478]] 
35 This [[H2063]] is the portion [[H4888]] of the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] since the day [[H3117]] they were presented [[H7126]] to serve the LORD [[H3068]] as priests. [[H3547]] 
36 On the day [[H3117]] they were anointed, [[H4886]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded that [[H6680]] this [[H834]] be given [[H5414]] them [[H853]] by  the sons [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]] It is a permanent [[H5769]] portion [[H2708]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] 
37 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of the burnt offering, [[H5930]] the grain offering, [[H4503]] the sin offering, [[H2403]] the guilt offering, [[H817]] the ordination offering, [[H4394]] and the peace offering, [[H8002]] 
38 which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] on Mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] on the day [[H3117]] He commanded [[H6680]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to present [[H7126]] their offerings [[H7133]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai. [[H5514]]
