1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] his sons, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] this [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded: [[H6680]] 
3 ‘Anyone [[H376]] from the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] who [[H834]] slaughters [[H7819]] an ox, [[H7794]] a lamb, [[H3775]] or [[H176]] a goat [[H5795]] in the camp [[H4264]] or outside [[H2351]] of [it] [[H4264]] 
4 instead of [[H3808]] bringing [[H935]] it to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] to present [[H7126]] it as an offering [[H7133]] to the LORD [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] His [[H3068]] tabernacle— [[H4908]] that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] shall incur [[H2803]] bloodguilt. [[H1818]] He has shed [[H8210]] blood [[H1818]] and must be cut off [[H3772]] from [[H7130]] his people. [[H5971]] 
5 For this reason [[H4616]] the Israelites [[H1121]] will bring [[H935]] to the LORD [[H3068]] the sacrifices [[H2077]] they [[H1992]] have been offering [[H2076]] in [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] fields. [[H7704]] They are to bring [[H935]] them to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and offer [[H2076]] them [[H853]] as sacrifices [[H2077]] of peace [[H8002]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
6 The priest [[H3548]] will then sprinkle [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and burn [[H6999]] the fat [[H2459]] as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
7 They must no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] offer [[H2076]] their sacrifices [[H2077]] to the goat demons [[H8163]] to which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] have prostituted [[H2181]] themselves. [[H310]] This [[H2063]] will be [[H1961]] a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for them [[H1992]] for the generations to come.’ [[H1755]] 
8 Tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that if anyone [[H376]] from [[H4480]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] or any foreigner [[H1616]] living [[H1481]] among them [[H8432]] offers [[H5927]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] or [[H176]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] 
9 but does not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] it to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] to sacrifice [[H6213]] it [[H853]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from among his people. [[H5971]] 
10 If anyone [[H376]] from [[H4480]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] or foreigner [[H1616]] living [[H1481]] among them [[H8432]] eats [[H398]] any [[H3605]] blood, [[H1818]] I will set [[H5414]] My face [[H6440]] against that person [[H5315]] and cut him off [[H3772]] from among [[H7130]] his people. [[H5971]] 
11 For [[H3588]] the life [[H5315]] of a creature [[H1320]] is in the blood, [[H1818]] and I [[H589]] have given it [[H5414]] to you  to make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] your souls [[H5315]] upon [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] since [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is the lifeblood [[H1818]] that makes atonement. [[H3722]] 
12 Therefore [[H5921]] I say [[H559]] to the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘None [[H3605]] of you [[H4480]] may eat [[H398]] blood, [[H1818]] nor may [[H3808]] any foreigner [[H1616]] living [[H1481]] among you [[H8432]] eat [[H398]] blood.’ [[H1818]] 
13 And if any [[H376]] Israelite [[H1121]] or foreigner [[H1616]] living [[H1481]] among them [[H8432]] hunts down [[H6679]] a wild [[H2416]] animal [[H6718]] or [[H176]] bird [[H5775]] that [[H834]] may be eaten, [[H398]] he must drain [[H8210]] its blood [[H1818]] and cover [[H3680]] it with dirt. [[H6083]] 
14 For [[H3588]] the life [[H5315]] of all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] is its blood. [[H1818]] Therefore I have told [[H559]] the Israelites: [[H1121]] You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the blood [[H1818]] of any [[H3605]] living thing, [[H1320]] because [[H3588]] the life [[H5315]] of all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] is its blood; [[H1818]] whoever [[H3605]] eats [[H398]] it must be cut off. [[H3772]] 
15 And any [[H3605]] person, [[H5315]] whether native [[H249]] or foreigner, [[H1616]] who [[H834]] eats [[H398]] anything found dead [[H5038]] or mauled by wild beasts [[H2966]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening; [[H6153]] then he will be clean. [[H2891]] 
16 But if [[H518]] he does not [[H3808]] wash [[H3526]] his clothes and bathe [[H7364]] himself, [[H1320]] then he shall bear [[H5375]] his iniquity.” [[H5771]]
