1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “This [[H2063]] is [[H1961]] the law [[H8451]] of the one afflicted with a skin disease [[H6879]] on the day [[H3117]] of his cleansing, [[H2893]] when he is brought [[H935]] to [[H413]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
3 The priest [[H3548]] is to go [[H3318]] outside [[H4480]] the camp [[H4264]] to examine him, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] the skin disease [[H6883]] of the afflicted person [[H6879]] has healed, [[H7495]] 
4 the priest [[H3548]] shall order [[H6680]] that two [[H8147]] live [[H2416]] clean [[H2889]] birds, [[H6833]] cedar [[H730]] wood, [[H6086]] scarlet yarn, [[H8144]] and hyssop [[H231]] be brought [[H3947]] for the one to be cleansed. [[H2891]] 
5 Then the priest [[H3548]] shall command [[H6680]] that one [[H259]] of the birds [[H6833]] be slaughtered [[H7819]] over [[H5921]] fresh [[H2416]] water [[H4325]] in [[H413]] a clay [[H2789]] pot. [[H3627]] 
6 And he is to take [[H3947]] the live [[H2416]] bird [[H6833]] together with the cedar [[H730]] wood, [[H6086]] scarlet yarn, [[H8144]] and hyssop, [[H231]] and dip [[H2881]] them [[H853]] into the blood [[H1818]] of the bird [[H6833]] that was slaughtered [[H7819]] over [[H5921]] the fresh [[H2416]] water. [[H4325]] 
7 Seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] he shall sprinkle [[H5137]] the one to be cleansed [[H2891]] of [[H4480]] the skin disease. [[H6883]] Then he shall pronounce him clean [[H2891]] and release [[H7971]] the live [[H2416]] bird [[H6833]] into [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] field. [[H7704]] 
8 The one being cleansed [[H2891]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] shave off [[H1548]] all [[H3605]] his hair, [[H8181]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] that he may be clean. [[H2891]] Afterward, [[H310]] he may enter [[H935]] the camp, [[H4264]] but he must remain [[H3427]] outside [[H2351]] his tent [[H168]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
9 On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] he must shave off [[H1548]] all [[H3605]] his hair— [[H8181]] his head, [[H7218]] his beard, [[H2206]] his eyebrows, [[H1354]] and the rest [[H3605]] of his hair. [[H8181]] He must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] himself [[H1320]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be clean. [[H2891]] 
10 On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] he is to bring [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] unblemished [[H8549]] male lambs, [[H3532]] an [[H259]] unblemished [[H8549]] ewe lamb [[H3535]] a year old, [[H1323]] a grain offering [[H4503]] of three-tenths [of an ephah] [[H7969]] of fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with olive oil, [[H8081]] and one [[H259]] log [[H3849]] of olive oil. [[H8081]] 
11 The priest [[H3548]] who performs the cleansing [[H2891]] shall present [[H5975]] the one [[H376]] to be cleansed, [[H2891]] together with these offerings, [[H854]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3069]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
12 Then the priest [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] one [[H259]] of the male lambs [[H3532]] and present [[H7126]] it as a guilt offering, [[H817]] along with the log [[H3849]] of olive oil; [[H8081]] and he must wave [[H5130]] them [[H853]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 Then he is to slaughter [[H7819]] the lamb [[H3532]] in the holy [[H6944]] place [[H4725]] where [[H4725]] the sin offering [[H2403]] and burnt offering [[H5930]] are slaughtered. [[H7819]] Like [[H3588]] the sin offering, [[H2403]] the guilt offering [[H817]] belongs to the priest; [[H3548]] it [[H1931]] [is] most [[H6944]] holy. [[H6944]] 
14 The priest [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] [some] of the blood [[H1818]] from the guilt offering [[H817]] and put [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] the lobe [[H8571]] of the right [[H3233]] ear [[H241]] of the one to be cleansed, [[H2891]] on [[H5921]] the thumb [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] hand, [[H3027]] and on [[H5921]] the big toe [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] foot. [[H7272]] 
15 Then the priest [[H3548]] shall take [[H3947]] [some] of the log [[H3849]] of olive oil, [[H8081]] pour [[H3332]] it into [[H5921]] his [[H3548]] left [[H8042]] palm, [[H3709]] 
16 dip [[H2881]] his right [[H3233]] forefinger [[H676]] into [[H4480]] the oil [[H8081]] in [[H5921]] his left [[H8042]] palm, [[H3709]] and sprinkle [[H5137]] some of [[H4480]] the oil [[H8081]] with his finger [[H676]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
17 And the priest [[H3548]] is to put [[H5414]] some [[H5921]] of the oil [[H8081]] remaining [[H3499]] in [[H5921]] his palm [[H3709]] on the lobe [[H8571]] of the right [[H3233]] ear [[H241]] of the one to be cleansed, [[H2891]] on [[H5921]] the thumb [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] hand, [[H3027]] and on [[H5921]] the big toe [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] foot, [[H7272]] on top of [[H5921]] the blood [[H1818]] of the guilt offering. [[H817]] 
18 The rest [[H3498]] of the oil [[H8081]] in his [[H5921]] palm, [[H3709]] the priest [[H3548]] is to put [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the one to be cleansed, [[H2891]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for him [[H5921]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
19 Then the priest [[H3548]] is to sacrifice [[H6213]] the sin offering [[H2403]] and make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the one to be cleansed [[H2891]] from his uncleanness. [[H2932]] After that, [[H310]] [the priest] shall slaughter [[H7819]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] 
20 and offer [[H5927]] [it] [[H5930]] on the altar, [[H4196]] with [[H853]] the grain offering, [[H4503]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for him, [[H5921]] and he will be clean. [[H2891]] 
21 If, however, [[H518]] [the person] [[H1931]] is poor [[H1800]] and cannot [[H369]] afford these [offerings], [[H3027]] he is to take [[H3947]] one [[H259]] male lamb [[H3532]] as a guilt offering [[H817]] to be waved [[H8573]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for him, [[H5921]] along with a tenth [an ephah] [[H6241]] of fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with olive oil [[H8081]] for a grain offering, [[H4503]] a log [[H3849]] of olive oil, [[H8081]] 
22 and two [[H8147]] turtledoves [[H8449]] or [[H176]] two [[H8147]] young [[H1121]] pigeons, [[H3123]] whichever [[H834]] he can afford, [[H5381]] one [[H259]] to be [[H1961]] a sin offering [[H2403]] and the other [[H259]] a burnt offering. [[H5930]] 
23 On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] he is to bring [[H935]] them [[H853]] for his cleansing [[H2893]] to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
24 The priest [[H3548]] shall take [[H3947]] the lamb [[H3532]] for the guilt offering, [[H817]] along with [[H853]] the log [[H3849]] of olive oil, [[H8081]] and wave [[H5130]] them [[H853]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
25 And after he slaughters [[H7819]] the lamb [[H3532]] for the guilt offering, [[H817]] the priest [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] [some] of the blood [[H1818]] of the guilt offering [[H817]] and put [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] the right [[H3233]] earlobe [[H8571]] of the one to be cleansed, [[H2891]] on [[H5921]] the thumb [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] hand, [[H3027]] and on [[H5921]] the big toe [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] foot. [[H7272]] 
26 Then the priest [[H3548]] is to pour [[H3332]] some of [[H4480]] the oil [[H8081]] into [[H5921]] his [[H3548]] left [[H8042]] palm [[H3709]] 
27 and sprinkle [[H5137]] with his right [[H3233]] forefinger [[H676]] some of [[H4480]] the oil [[H8081]] in [[H5921]] his left [[H8042]] palm [[H3709]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
28 The priest [[H3548]] shall also put [[H5414]] some of [[H4480]] the oil [[H8081]] in [[H5921]] his palm [[H3709]] on [[H5921]] the right [[H3233]] earlobe [[H8571]] of the one to be cleansed, [[H2891]] on [[H5921]] the thumb [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] hand, [[H3027]] and on [[H5921]] the big toe [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] foot— [[H7272]] on [[H5921]] the same places [[H4725]] as the blood [[H1818]] of the guilt offering. [[H817]] 
29 The rest [[H3498]] of [[H4480]] the oil [[H8081]] in his [[H5921]] palm, [[H3709]] the priest [[H3548]] is to put [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the one to be cleansed, [[H2891]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for him [[H5921]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
30 Then he must sacrifice [[H6213]] one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] the turtledoves [[H8449]] or [[H176]] young [[H1121]] pigeons, [[H3123]] whichever [[H834]] he can afford, [[H5381]] 
31 one [[H259]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] and the other [[H259]] as a burnt offering, [[H5930]] together with [[H5921]] the grain offering. [[H4503]] In this way the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] for [[H5921]] the one to be cleansed. [[H2891]] 
32 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] for someone who [[H834]] has a skin disease [[H6883]] and cannot [[H3808]] afford [[H5381]] the cost of his cleansing.” [[H2893]] 
33 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
34 “When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] am giving [[H5414]] you  as your possession, [[H272]] and I put [[H5414]] a contamination [[H5061]] of mildew [[H6883]] into a house [[H1004]] in that land, [[H776]] 
35 the owner [[H834]] of the house [[H1004]] shall come [[H935]] and tell [[H5046]] the priest, [[H3548]] ‘Something like mildew [[H5061]] has appeared [[H7200]] in my  house.’ [[H1004]] 
36 The priest [[H3548]] must order that [[H6680]] the house [[H1004]] be cleared [[H6437]] before [[H2962]] he [[H3548]] enters it [[H935]] to examine [[H7200]] the mildew, [[H5061]] lest [[H3808]] everything [[H3605]] in the house [[H1004]] becomes unclean. [[H2930]] After [[H310]] this, [[H3651]] the priest [[H3548]] shall go in [[H935]] to inspect [[H7200]] the house. [[H1004]] 
37 He is to examine [[H7200]] [the house], [[H5061]] and if [[H2009]] the mildew [[H5061]] on the walls [[H7023]] consists of green [[H3422]] or [[H176]] red [[H125]] depressions [[H8258]] that appear [[H4758]] to be beneath [[H8217]] the surface of the wall, [[H7023]] 
38 the priest [[H3548]] shall go outside [[H3318]] the doorway [[H6607]] of the house [[H1004]] and close [[H5462]] [it] up [[H1004]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
39 On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the priest [[H3548]] is to return [[H7725]] and inspect [the house]. [[H7200]] If [[H2009]] the mildew [[H5061]] has spread [[H6581]] on the walls, [[H7023]] 
40 [he] [[H3548]] must order [[H6680]] that [[H834]] the contaminated [[H5061]] stones [[H68]] be pulled out [[H2502]] and thrown [[H7993]] into [[H413]] an unclean [[H2931]] place [[H4725]] outside [[H2351]] the city. [[H5892]] 
41 And [[H853]] he shall order the inside [[H1004]] of the house [[H1004]] completely [[H5439]] scraped, [[H7106]] and the plaster [[H6083]] that [[H834]] is scraped off [[H7096]] must be dumped [[H8210]] into [[H413]] an unclean [[H2931]] place [[H4725]] outside [[H2351]] the city. [[H5892]] 
42 So different [[H312]] stones [[H68]] must be obtained [[H3947]] to replace [[H935]] the [contaminated] ones, [[H68]] and additional [[H312]] mortar [[H6083]] to replaster [[H2902]] the house. [[H1004]] 
43 If [[H518]] the mildew [[H5061]] reappears [[H7725]] in the house [[H1004]] after [[H310]] the stones [[H68]] have been torn out [[H2502]] and [[H310]] the house [[H1004]] has been scraped [[H7096]] and replastered, [[H2902]] 
44 the priest [[H3548]] must come [[H935]] and inspect it. [[H7200]] If [[H2009]] the mildew [[H5061]] has spread [[H6581]] in the house, [[H1004]] it [is] [[H1931]] a destructive [[H3992]] mildew; [[H6883]] the house [[H1004]] is unclean. [[H2931]] 
45 It [[H1004]] must be torn down [[H5422]] with its stones, [[H68]] its timbers, [[H6086]] and all [[H3605]] its [[H1004]] plaster, [[H6083]] and taken [[H3318]] outside [[H2351]] the city [[H5892]] to [[H413]] an unclean [[H2931]] place. [[H4725]] 
46 Anyone who enters [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] during any [[H3605]] of the days [[H3117]] that it is closed up [[H5462]] will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
47 And anyone who sleeps [[H7901]] in the house [[H1004]] or eats [[H398]] in it [[H1004]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes. [[H899]] 
48 If, however, [[H518]] the priest [[H3548]] comes [[H935]] and inspects it, [[H7200]] and [[H2009]] the mildew [[H5061]] has not [[H3808]] spread [[H6581]] after [[H310]] the house [[H1004]] has been replastered, [[H2902]] he [[H3548]] shall pronounce the house [[H1004]] clean, [[H2891]] because [[H3588]] the mildew [[H5061]] is gone. [[H7495]] 
49 [The priest] is to take [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] birds, [[H6833]] cedar [[H730]] wood, [[H6086]] scarlet yarn, [[H8144]] and hyssop [[H231]] to purify [[H2398]] the house; [[H1004]] 
50 and he shall slaughter [[H7819]] one [[H259]] of the birds [[H6833]] over [[H413]] fresh [[H2416]] water [[H4325]] in a clay [[H2789]] pot. [[H3627]] 
51 Then he shall take [[H3947]] the cedar [[H730]] wood, [[H6086]] the hyssop, [[H231]] the scarlet yarn, [[H8144]] and the live [[H2416]] bird, [[H6833]] dip [[H2881]] them in the blood [[H1818]] of the slaughtered [[H7819]] bird [[H6833]] and the fresh [[H2416]] water, [[H4325]] and sprinkle [[H5137]] the house [[H1004]] seven [[H7651]] times. [[H6471]] 
52 And he shall cleanse [[H2398]] the house [[H1004]] with the bird’s [[H6833]] blood, [[H1818]] the fresh [[H2416]] water, [[H4325]] the live [[H2416]] bird, [[H6833]] the cedar [[H730]] wood, [[H6086]] the hyssop, [[H231]] and the scarlet yarn. [[H8144]] 
53 Finally, he is to release [[H7971]] the live [[H2416]] bird [[H6833]] into [[H413]] the open [[H6440]] fields [[H7704]] outside [[H2351]] the city. [[H5892]] In this way he will make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the house, [[H1004]] and it will be clean. [[H2891]] 
54 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] for any [[H3605]] skin disease [[H6883]] or mildew, [[H5061]] for a scaly outbreak, [[H5424]] 
55 for mildew [[H6883]] in clothing [[H899]] or in a house, [[H1004]] 
56 and for a swelling, [[H7613]] rash, [[H5597]] or spot, [[H934]] 
57 to determine [[H3384]] when [[H3117]] something is clean [[H2889]] or unclean. [[H2931]] This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] regarding skin diseases and mildew.” [[H6883]]
