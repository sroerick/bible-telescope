1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and say [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] ‘These [[H428]] are My appointed feasts, [[H4150]] the feasts [[H4150]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] you will proclaim [[H7121]] as sacred [[H6944]] assemblies. [[H4744]] 
3 For six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] work [[H4399]] may be done, [[H6213]] but the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] is to be a Sabbath [[H7676]] of complete rest, [[H7677]] a day of sacred [[H6944]] assembly. [[H4744]] You are not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] work; [[H4399]] wherever [[H3605]] you live, [[H4186]] it [[H1931]] is a Sabbath [[H7676]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 These [[H428]] are the LORD’s [[H3068]] appointed feasts, [[H4150]] the sacred [[H6944]] assemblies [[H4744]] you are to proclaim [[H7121]] at their appointed times. [[H4150]] 
5 The Passover [[H6453]] to the LORD [[H3069]] begins at [[H996]] twilight [[H6153]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H2320]] of the first [[H7223]] month. [[H2320]] 
6 On the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the same [[H2088]] month [begins] [[H2320]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Unleavened Bread [[H4682]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] you must eat [[H398]] unleavened bread. [[H4682]] 
7 On the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] you shall hold [[H1961]] a sacred [[H6944]] assembly; [[H4744]] you are not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] ordinary [[H5656]] work. [[H4399]] 
8 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] you are to present [[H7126]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] there shall be a sacred [[H6944]] assembly; [[H4744]] you must not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] ordinary [[H5656]] work.’” [[H4399]] 
9 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
10 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and say, [[H559]] ‘When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] I [[H589]] am giving [[H5414]] you  and reap [[H7114]] its harvest, [[H7105]] you are to bring [[H935]] to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] the sheaf [[H6016]] of the firstfruits [[H7225]] of your harvest. [[H7105]] 
11 And he shall wave [[H5130]] the sheaf [[H6016]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] so that it may be accepted of your behalf; [[H7522]] the priest [[H3548]] is to wave it [[H5130]] on the day after [[H4283]] the Sabbath. [[H7676]] 
12 On the day [[H3117]] you wave [[H5130]] the sheaf, [[H6016]] you shall offer [[H6213]] a year-old [[H1121]] lamb [[H3532]] without blemish [[H8549]] as a burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] 
13 along with its grain offering [[H4503]] of two-tenths an ephah [[H8147]] of fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with oil— [[H8081]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma— [[H7381]] and its drink offering [[H5262]] of a quarter [[H7243]] hin [[H1969]] of wine. [[H3196]] 
14 You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] any bread [[H3899]] or roasted [[H7039]] or new grain [[H3759]] until [[H5704]] the [[H2088]] very [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] you have brought [[H935]] this [[H853]] offering [[H7133]] to your God. [[H430]] This is to be a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the generations to come, [[H1755]] wherever [[H3605]] you live. [[H4186]] 
15 From the day after [[H4283]] the Sabbath, [[H7676]] the day [[H3117]] you brought [[H935]] the sheaf [[H6016]] of the wave offering, [[H8573]] you are to count [[H5608]] seven [[H7651]] full [[H8549]] weeks. [[H7676]] 
16 You shall count [[H5608]] fifty [[H2572]] days [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] the day after [[H4283]] the seventh [[H7637]] Sabbath, [[H7676]] and then present [[H7126]] an offering of new [[H2319]] grain [[H4503]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
17 Bring [[H935]] two [[H8147]] loaves of bread [[H3899]] from your dwellings [[H4186]] as a wave offering, [[H8573]] each made from two-tenths an ephah [[H8147]] of fine flour, [[H5560]] baked [[H644]] with yeast, [[H2557]] as the firstfruits [[H1061]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
18 Along with [[H5921]] the bread [[H3899]] you are to present [[H7126]] seven [[H7651]] unblemished [[H8549]] male lambs [[H3532]] a year old, [[H1121]] one [[H259]] young bull, [[H6499]] and two [[H8147]] rams. [[H352]] They will be [[H1961]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] together with their grain offerings [[H4503]] and drink offerings— [[H5262]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] of a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
19 You shall also prepare [[H6213]] one [[H259]] male goat [[H8163]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] and two [[H8147]] male lambs [[H3532]] a year old [[H1121]] as a peace offering. [[H8002]] 
20 The priest [[H3548]] is to wave [[H5130]] [the lambs] [[H853]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] together with [[H5921]] the bread [[H3899]] of the firstfruits. [[H1061]] The bread and the two [[H8147]] lambs [[H3532]] are to be [[H1961]] sacred [[H6944]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for the priest. [[H3548]] 
21 On that [[H2088]] same [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] you are to proclaim [[H7121]] a sacred [[H6944]] assembly, [[H4744]] and  you are not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] regular work. [[H4399]] This is to be a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] wherever [[H3605]] you live [[H4186]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] 
22 When you reap [[H7114]] the harvest [[H7105]] of your land, [[H776]] do not [[H3808]] reap [[H7114]] all the way [[H3615]] to the edges [[H6285]] of your field [[H7704]] or gather [[H3950]] the gleanings [[H3951]] of your harvest. [[H7105]] Leave [[H5800]] them for the poor [[H6041]] and the foreign resident. [[H1616]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God.’” [[H430]] 
23 The LORD also [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
24 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] [and] say, [[H559]] ‘On the first [[H259]] day [[H2320]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month [[H2320]] you are to have [[H1961]] a day of rest, [[H7677]] a sacred [[H6944]] assembly [[H4744]] announced [[H2146]] by trumpet blasts. [[H8643]] 
25 You must not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] ordinary work, [[H4399]] but you are to present [[H7126]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD.’” [[H3068]] 
26 Again the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
27 “The tenth [[H6218]] day of this [[H2088]] seventh [[H7637]] month [[H2320]] is the Day [[H3117]] of Atonement. [[H3725]] You are to hold [[H1961]] a sacred [[H6944]] assembly [[H4744]] and humble [[H6031]] your souls [[H5315]] and present [[H7126]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
28 On this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] you are not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] work, [[H4399]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is the Day [[H3117]] of Atonement, [[H3725]] when atonement is made [[H3722]] for you [[H5921]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
29 If [[H3588]] anyone [[H3605]] does not [[H3808]] humble himself [[H6031]] on this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] he must be cut off [[H3772]] from his people. [[H5971]] 
30 I will destroy [[H6]] from among [[H7130]] his people [[H5971]] anyone [[H3605]] who [[H834]] does [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] work [[H4399]] on this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
31 You are not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] work {at all}. [[H4399]] This is a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the generations to come, [[H1755]] wherever [[H3605]] you live. [[H4186]] 
32 It [[H1931]] will be a Sabbath [[H7676]] of complete rest [[H7677]] for you,  and you shall humble [[H6031]] your souls. [[H5315]] From the evening [[H6153]] of the ninth [[H8672]] day of the month [[H2320]] until [[H5704]] the following evening [[H6153]] you are to observe [[H7673]] your Sabbath.’” [[H7676]] 
33 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
34 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] [and] say, [[H559]] ‘On the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the [[H2088]] seventh [[H7637]] month [[H2320]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Tabernacles [[H5521]] to the LORD [begins], [[H3068]] and it continues for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
35 On the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] [there shall be] a sacred [[H6944]] assembly. [[H4744]] You are not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] regular work. [[H4399]] 
36 For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] you are to present [[H7126]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] you are to hold [[H1961]] a sacred [[H6944]] assembly [[H4744]] and present [[H7126]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] It [is] [[H1931]] a solemn assembly; [[H6116]] you are not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] regular work. [[H4399]] 
37 “These [[H428]] are the LORD’s [[H3068]] appointed feasts, [[H4150]] which [[H834]] you are to proclaim [[H7121]] as sacred [[H6944]] assemblies [[H4744]] for presenting [[H7126]] offerings by fire [[H801]] to the LORD— [[H3068]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and grain offerings, [[H4503]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and drink offerings, [[H5262]] each on [[H1697]] its designated [[H3117]] day. [[H3117]] 
38 [These offerings are] in addition to [[H905]] the offerings for the LORD’s [[H3068]] Sabbaths, [[H7676]] [and in addition] to your gifts, [[H4979]] to all [[H3605]] your vow offerings, [[H5088]] and to all [[H3605]] the freewill offerings [[H5071]] you give [[H5414]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
39 On the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] after you have gathered [[H622]] the produce [[H8393]] of the land, [[H776]] you are to celebrate [[H2287]] a feast [[H2282]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] There shall be complete rest [[H7677]] on the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] and [also] [[H7677]] on the eighth [[H8066]] day. [[H3117]] 
40 On the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] you are to gather [[H3947]] the branches [[H6529]] of majestic [[H1926]] trees— [[H6086]] palm [[H8558]] branches [[H3709]] and boughs [[H6057]] of leafy [[H5687]] trees [[H6086]] and willows [[H6155]] of the brook— [[H5158]] and rejoice [[H8055]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
41 You are to celebrate [[H2287]] this [[H853]] as a feast [[H2282]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] each year. [[H8141]] This is a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the generations to come; [[H1755]] you are to celebrate [[H2287]] it [[H853]] in the seventh [[H7637]] month. [[H2320]] 
42 You are to live [[H3427]] in booths [[H5521]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] All [[H3605]] the native-born [[H249]] of Israel [[H3478]] must live [[H3427]] in booths, [[H5521]] 
43 so that [[H4616]] your descendants [[H1755]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I made the Israelites [[H1121]] live [[H3427]] in booths [[H5521]] when I brought them out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God.’” [[H430]] 
44 So Moses [[H4872]] announced [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] the appointed [feasts] [[H4150]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
