[[Leviticus 18|←]] • [[Leviticus 20|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell [[H559]] them: [[H413]] ‘Be [[H1961]] holy [[H6918]] because [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] am holy. [[H6918]] 
3 Each [[H376]] of you must respect [[H3372]] his mother [[H517]] and father, [[H1]] and you must observe [[H8104]] My Sabbaths. [[H7676]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
4 Do not [[H408]] turn [[H6437]] to [[H413]] idols [[H457]] or make [[H6213]] for yourselves  molten [[H4541]] gods. [[H430]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
5 When [[H3588]] you sacrifice [[H2076]] a peace offering [[H8002]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] you shall offer it [[H2076]] for your acceptance. [[H7522]] 
6 It shall be eaten [[H398]] on the day [[H3117]] you sacrifice it, [[H2077]] or on the next day; [[H4283]] but what remains [[H3498]] on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] must be burned up. [[H784]] 
7 If [[H518]] any is eaten [[H398]] on the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] it [[H1931]] is tainted [[H6292]] and will not [[H3808]] be accepted. [[H7521]] 
8 Whoever eats [[H398]] it will bear [[H5375]] his iniquity, [[H5771]] for [[H3588]] he has profaned [[H2490]] what is holy [[H6944]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] That [[H1931]] person [[H5315]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from his people. [[H5971]] 
9 When you reap [[H7114]] the harvest [[H7105]] of your land, [[H776]] you are not [[H3808]] to reap [[H3615]] to the very edges [[H6285]] of your field [[H7704]] or gather [[H3950]] the gleanings [[H3951]] of your harvest. [[H7105]] 
10 You must not [[H3808]] strip your vineyard [[H3754]] bare [[H5953]] or gather [[H3950]] its [[H3754]] fallen grapes. [[H6528]] Leave [[H5800]] them [[H853]] for the poor [[H6041]] and the sojourner. [[H1616]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3069]] your God. [[H430]] 
11 You must not [[H3808]] steal. [[H1589]] You must not [[H3808]] lie [[H3584]] or deceive [[H8266]] one [[H376]] another. [[H5997]] 
12 You must not [[H3808]] swear [[H7650]] falsely [[H8267]] by My name [[H8034]] and so profane [[H2490]] the name [[H8034]] of your God. [[H430]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 You must not [[H3808]] defraud [[H6231]] your neighbor [[H7453]] or [[H3808]] rob him. [[H1497]] You [[H854]] must not [[H3808]] withhold [[H3885]] until [[H5704]] morning [[H1242]] the wages [[H6468]] due a hired hand. [[H7916]] 
14 You must not [[H3808]] curse [[H7043]] the deaf [[H2795]] or place [[H5414]] a stumbling block [[H4383]] before [[H6440]] the blind, [[H5787]] but you are to fear [[H3372]] your God. [[H430]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
15 “You must not [[H3808]] pervert [[H6213]] justice; [[H4941]] you must not [[H3808]] show partiality [[H5375]] to the poor [[H1800]] or [[H3808]] favoritism [[H1921]] to the rich; [[H1419]] you are to judge [[H8199]] your neighbor [[H5997]] fairly. [[H6664]] 
16 You must not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] about spreading slander [[H7400]] among your people. [[H5971]] You must not [[H3808]] endanger [[H5975]] the life [[H1818]] of your neighbor. [[H7453]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
17 You must not [[H3808]] harbor hatred [[H8130]] against your brother [[H251]] in your heart. [[H3824]] Directly [[H3198]] rebuke [[H3198]] your neighbor, [[H5997]] so that you will not [[H3808]] incur [[H5375]] guilt [[H2399]] on account of him. [[H5921]] 
18 Do not [[H3808]] seek revenge [[H5358]] or bear a grudge [[H5201]] against any [[H1121]] of your people, [[H5971]] but love [[H157]] your neighbor [[H7453]] as yourself. [[H3644]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
19 You are to keep [[H8104]] My statutes. [[H2708]] You shall not [[H3808]] crossbreed [[H7250]] two different kinds [[H3610]] of livestock; [[H929]] you shall not sow [[H2232]] your fields [[H7704]] with two kinds [[H3610]] of seed; [[H5927]] and you shall not wear [[H5921]] clothing [[H899]] made of two kinds [[H3610]] of material. [[H8162]] 
20 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] has sexual relations with [[H7901]] a slave girl [[H8198]] promised [[H2778]] to another man [[H376]] but who has not [[H3808]] been redeemed [[H6299]] or [[H176]] given [[H5414]] her freedom, [[H2668]] there must be [[H1961]] due punishment. [[H1244]] [But] they are not [[H3808]] to be put to death, [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] she had not [[H3808]] been freed. [[H2666]] 
21 [The man,] however, must bring [[H935]] a ram [[H352]] to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] as his guilt offering [[H817]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
22 The priest [[H3548]] shall make atonement [[H3722]] on his behalf [[H5921]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] with the ram [[H352]] of the guilt offering [[H817]] for [[H5921]] the sin [[H2403]] he has committed, [[H2398]] and he will be forgiven [[H5545]] the sin [[H2403]] he has committed. [[H2398]] 
23 When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] and plant [[H5193]] any [[H3605]] kind of tree [[H6086]] for food, [[H3978]] you shall regard [[H6188]] the fruit [[H6529]] as forbidden. [[H6190]] For three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] it will be [[H1961]] forbidden [[H6189]] to you  and must not [[H3808]] be eaten. [[H398]] 
24 In the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] all [[H3605]] its fruit [[H6529]] must be [[H1961]] consecrated [[H6944]] as a praise offering [[H1974]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
25 But in the fifth [[H2549]] year [[H8141]] you may eat [[H398]] its fruit; [[H6529]] thus your  harvest [[H8393]] will be increased. [[H3254]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
26 You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] anything with [[H5921]] blood still in it. [[H1818]] You must not [[H3808]] practice divination [[H5172]] or sorcery. [[H6049]] 
27 You must not [[H3808]] cut off the hair [[H5362]] at the sides [[H6285]] of your head [[H7218]] or clip off [[H7843]] the edges [[H6285]] of your beard. [[H2206]] 
28 You must not [[H3808]] make any cuts [[H8296]] in your bodies [[H1320]] for the dead [[H5315]] or put [[H5414]] tattoo [[H7085]] marks on yourselves. [[H3793]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
29 You must not [[H408]] defile [[H2490]] your daughter [[H1323]] by making her a prostitute, [[H2181]] or [[H3808]] the land [[H776]] will be prostituted [[H2181]] and filled [[H4390]] with depravity. [[H2154]] 
30 You must keep [[H8104]] My Sabbaths [[H7676]] and have reverence for [[H3372]] My sanctuary. [[H4720]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
31 “You must not [[H408]] turn [[H6437]] to [[H413]] mediums [[H178]] [or] [[H413]] spiritists; [[H3049]] do not seek them out, [[H1245]] or you will be defiled [[H2930]] by them.  I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
32 You are to rise [[H6965]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the elderly, [[H7872]] honor [[H1921]] the aged, [[H2205]] and fear [[H3372]] your God. [[H430]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
33 When [[H3588]] a foreigner [[H1616]] resides [[H1481]] with you [[H854]] in your land, [[H776]] you must not [[H3808]] oppress [[H3238]] him. [[H853]] 
34 You must treat [[H1961]] the foreigner [[H1616]] living [[H1481]] among you [[H854]] as native-born [[H249]] and love [[H157]] him  as yourself, [[H3644]] for [[H3588]] you were [[H1961]] foreigners [[H1616]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
35 You must not [[H3808]] use [[H6213]] dishonest [[H5766]] measures [[H4941]] of length, [[H4060]] weight, [[H4948]] or volume. [[H4884]] 
36 You shall maintain [[H1961]] honest [[H6664]] scales [[H3976]] [and] [[H6664]] weights, [[H68]] an honest [[H6664]] ephah, [[H374]] [and] an honest [[H6664]] hin. [[H1969]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought [[H3318]] you [[H853]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
37 You must keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] My statutes [[H2708]] and all [[H3605]] My ordinances [[H4941]] and follow [[H6213]] them. [[H853]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]]
