1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Tell [[H1696]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] to treat with respect [[H5144]] the sacred offerings [[H6944]] that [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] have consecrated to Me, [[H6942]] so that they do not [[H3808]] profane [[H2490]] My holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 Say [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] ‘For the generations to come, [[H1755]] if any [[H3605]] of your descendants [[H2233]] in a state of uncleanness [[H2932]] approaches [[H7126]] the sacred offerings [[H6944]] that [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] consecrate [[H6942]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H1931]] person [[H5315]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from My presence. [[H6440]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 None [[H3808]] of [[H4480]] Aaron’s [[H175]] descendants [[H2233]] who has a skin disease [[H6879]] or [[H176]] a discharge [[H2100]] shall eat [[H398]] from the sacred offerings [[H6944]] until [[H5704]] he is clean. [[H2891]] Whoever touches [[H5060]] anything [[H3605]] defiled [[H2931]] by a corpse [[H5315]] or [[H176]] by a man [[H376]] who [[H834]] has [[H3318]] an emission [[H7902]] of semen, [[H2233]] 
5 or [[H176]] whoever [[H376]] touches [[H5060]] a [[H3605]] crawling creature [[H8318]] or [[H176]] a person [[H120]] that [[H834]] makes him unclean, [[H2930]] whatever [[H3605]] the uncleanness may be, [[H2932]] 
6 the man [[H5315]] who [[H834]] touches [[H5060]] any of these will remain unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] He must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] from [[H4480]] the sacred offerings [[H6944]] unless [[H3588]] he has bathed [[H7364]] himself [[H1320]] with water. [[H4325]] 
7 When the sun [[H8121]] has set, [[H935]] he will become clean, [[H2891]] and then [[H310]] he may eat [[H398]] from [[H4480]] the sacred offerings, [[H6944]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] are his food. [[H3899]] 
8 He must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] anything found dead [[H5038]] or torn by wild animals, [[H2966]] which would make him unclean. [[H2930]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
9 [The priests] must keep [[H8104]] My charge, [[H4931]] lest [[H3808]] they bear [[H5375]] the guilt [[H2399]] and die [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] they profane it. [[H2490]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] who sanctifies them. [[H6942]] 
10 No [[H3808]] one [[H3605]] outside [[H2114]] a priest’s family is to eat [[H398]] the sacred offering, [[H6944]] nor may a foreigner [[H8453]] staying with a priest, [[H3548]] or a hired hand, [[H7916]] eat [[H398]] of [it]. [[H6944]] 
11 But if [[H3588]] a priest [[H3548]] purchases [[H7069]] someone [[H5315]] with [[H7075]] his money, [[H3701]] or one [[H1992]] is born [[H3211]] in his household, [[H1004]] that person [[H1931]] may eat [[H398]] of it.  
12 If [[H3588]] the priest’s [[H3548]] daughter [[H1323]] is married [[H1961]] to a man [[H376]] other [than a priest], [[H2114]] she [[H1931]] is not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] of the sacred [[H6944]] contributions. [[H8641]] 
13 But if [[H3588]] a priest’s [[H3548]] daughter [[H1323]] with no [[H369]] children [[H2233]] becomes [[H1961]] widowed [[H490]] or divorced [[H1644]] and returns [[H7725]] to [[H413]] her father’s [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] she may share [[H398]] her father’s [[H1]] food [[H3899]] as in her youth. [[H5271]] But no [[H3605]] outsider [[H2114]] may share [[H398]] it.  
14 If [[H3588]] anyone [[H376]] eats [[H398]] a sacred offering [[H6944]] in error, [[H7684]] he must add [[H3254]] a fifth [[H2549]] to [[H5921]] its value and give [[H5414]] the sacred offering [[H6944]] to the priest. [[H3548]] 
15 The priests must not [[H3808]] profane [[H2490]] the sacred offerings [[H6944]] the Israelites [[H1121]] present [[H7311]] to the LORD [[H3068]] 
16 by allowing the people to eat [[H398]] the sacred offerings [[H6944]] and thus to bear [[H5375]] the punishment [[H5771]] for guilt. [[H819]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] who sanctifies [[H6942]] them.’”  
17 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
18 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell [[H559]] them, [[H413]] ‘Any man [[H376]] of [[H4480]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] or any foreign resident [[H1616]] who [[H834]] presents [[H7126]] his offering, [[H7133]] whether [[H7126]] the burnt offering [is] [[H5930]] a freewill gift [[H5071]] or payment of a vow [[H5088]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] 
19 must offer an unblemished [[H8549]] male [[H2145]] from the cattle, [[H1241]] sheep, [[H3775]] or goats [[H5795]] in order for it to be accepted on your behalf. [[H7522]] 
20 You must not [[H3808]] present [[H7126]] anything [[H3605]] with [[H834]] a defect, [[H3971]] because [[H3588]] it will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] accepted on your behalf. [[H7522]] 
21 When [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] presents [[H7126]] a peace offering [[H8002]] to the LORD [[H3069]] from the herd [[H1241]] or [[H176]] flock [[H6629]] to fulfill [[H6381]] a vow [[H5088]] or [[H176]] as a freewill offering, [[H5071]] it must be [[H1961]] without blemish [[H8549]] [or] [[H1961]] defect [[H3971]] to be acceptable. [[H7522]] 
22 You are not [[H3808]] to present [[H7126]] any animal to the LORD [[H3068]] that is blind, [[H5788]] injured, [[H7665]] or [[H176]] maimed, [[H2782]] or [[H176]] anything with a running sore, [[H2990]] festering rash, [[H1618]] or scab; [[H3217]] you must not [[H3808]] put [[H5414]] any of these [[H1992]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] as an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
23 You may present [[H6213]] as a freewill offering [[H5071]] an ox [[H7794]] or sheep [[H7716]] that has a deformed [[H8311]] or stunted limb, [[H7038]] but it is not [[H3808]] acceptable [[H7521]] to fulfill a vow. [[H5088]] 
24 You are not [[H3808]] to present [[H7126]] to the LORD [[H3068]] [an animal whose testicles are] bruised, [[H4600]] crushed, [[H3807]] torn, [[H5423]] or cut; [[H3772]] you are not to [[H3808]] sacrifice them [[H6213]] in your land. [[H776]] 
25 Neither you nor [[H3808]] a foreigner [[H1121]] shall present [[H7126]] food [[H3899]] to your God [[H430]] from any [[H3605]] such [animal]. [[H428]] They will not [[H3808]] be accepted [[H7521]] on your behalf,  because [[H3588]] they are deformed [[H4893]] and flawed.’” [[H3971]] 
26 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
27 “When [[H3588]] an ox, [[H7794]] a sheep, [[H3775]] or [[H176]] a goat [[H5795]] is born, [[H3205]] it must remain [[H1961]] with [[H8478]] its mother [[H517]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] From the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] on, [[H1973]] it will be acceptable [[H7521]] as an offering [[H7133]] to the LORD [[H3068]] made by fire. [[H801]] 
28 But you must not [[H3808]] slaughter [[H7819]] an ox [[H7794]] or [[H176]] sheep [[H7716]] on the same [[H259]] day [[H3117]] as its young. [[H1121]] 
29 When [[H3588]] you sacrifice [[H2076]] a thank [[H8426]] offering [[H2077]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] offer it [[H2076]] so that it may be acceptable on your behalf. [[H7522]] 
30 It must be eaten [[H398]] that same [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]] Do not [[H3808]] leave [[H3498]] any of it [[H4480]] until [[H5704]] morning. [[H1242]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
31 You are to keep [[H8104]] My commandments [[H4687]] and practice [[H6213]] them. [[H853]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
32 You must not [[H3808]] profane [[H2490]] My holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]] I must be acknowledged as holy [[H6942]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] who sanctifies you, [[H6942]] 
33 who brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] to be [[H1961]] your God. [[H430]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.” [[H3068]]
