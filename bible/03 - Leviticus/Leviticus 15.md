# Leviticus 15
[[Leviticus 14|←]] • [[Leviticus 16|→]]
1 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
2 “Say [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘When [[H3588]] any [[H376]] man [[H376]] has [[H1961]] a bodily [[H1320]] discharge, [[H2100]] the discharge [[H2101]] is unclean. [[H2931]] 
3 This [[H2063]] uncleanness [[H2932]] is [[H1961]] from his discharge, [[H2101]] whether his body [[H1320]] allows [[H7325]] the discharge {to flow} [[H2101]] or [[H176]] blocks it. [[H2856]] So his discharge [[H2101]] will bring about [[H1931]] uncleanness. [[H2932]] 
4 Any [[H3605]] bed [[H4904]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] the man with the discharge [[H2100]] lies [[H7901]] will be unclean, [[H2930]] and any [[H3605]] furniture [[H3627]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] he sits [[H3427]] will be unclean. [[H2930]] 
5 Anyone [[H376]] who [[H834]] touches [[H5060]] his bed [[H4904]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
6 Whoever sits [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] furniture [[H3627]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] the man with the discharge [[H2100]] was sitting [[H3427]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
7 Whoever touches [[H5060]] the body [[H1320]] of the man with a discharge [[H2100]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
8 If [[H3588]] the man with the discharge [[H2100]] spits [[H7556]] on one who is clean, [[H2889]] [that person] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
9 Any [[H3605]] saddle [[H4817]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] the man with the discharge [[H2100]] rides [[H7392]] will be unclean. [[H2930]] 
10 Whoever [[H3605]] touches [[H5060]] anything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was [[H1961]] under [[H8478]] him will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] and whoever carries [[H5375]] such things [[H853]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
11 If the man with the discharge [[H2100]] touches [[H5060]] anyone [[H3605]] without [[H3808]] first rinsing [[H7857]] his hands [[H3027]] with water, [[H4325]] the one who was touched must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
12 Any clay [[H2789]] pot [[H3627]] that [[H834]] the man with the discharge [[H2100]] touches [[H5060]] must be broken, [[H7665]] and any [[H3605]] wooden [[H6086]] utensil [[H3627]] must be rinsed [[H7857]] with water. [[H4325]] 
13 When [[H3588]] the man [[H2100]] has been cleansed [[H2891]] from his discharge, [[H2101]] he must count off [[H5608]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] for his  cleansing, [[H2893]] wash [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] himself [[H1320]] in fresh [[H2416]] water, [[H4325]] and he shall be clean. [[H2891]] 
14 On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] he is to take [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] turtledoves [[H8449]] or [[H176]] two [[H8147]] young [[H1121]] pigeons, [[H3123]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and give [[H5414]] them to [[H413]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
15 The priest [[H3548]] is to sacrifice [[H6213]] them, [[H853]] one [[H259]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] and the other [[H259]] as a burnt offering. [[H5930]] In this way the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] [the man] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] because of his discharge. [[H2101]] 
16 When [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] has an emission [[H7902]] of semen, [[H2233]] he must bathe [[H7364]] his whole [[H3605]] body [[H1320]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
17 Any [[H3605]] clothing [[H899]] or leather [[H5785]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] there is [[H1961]] an emission [[H7902]] of semen [[H2233]] must be washed [[H3526]] with water, [[H4325]] and it will remain unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
18 If a man [[H376]] lies with [[H7901]] a woman [[H802]] and there is an emission [[H7902]] of semen, [[H2233]] both must bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and they will remain unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
19 When [[H3588]] a woman [[H802]] has [[H1961]] a discharge [[H2101]] consisting [[H1961]] of blood [[H1818]] from her body, [[H1320]] for seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] she will be [[H1961]] unclean due to menstruation, [[H5079]] and anyone [[H3605]] who touches [[H5060]] her  will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
20 Anything [[H3605]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] she lies [[H7901]] or sits [[H3427]] during her menstruation [[H5079]] will be unclean, [[H2930]] 
21 and anyone [[H3605]] who touches [[H5060]] her bed [[H4904]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
22 And whoever [[H3605]] touches [[H5060]] any [[H3605]] furniture [[H3627]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] she was sitting [[H3427]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] 
23 and whether [[H518]] it is [[H1931]] a bed [[H4904]] or [[H176]] furniture [[H3627]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] she [[H1931]] was sitting, [[H3427]] whoever touches [[H5060]] it  will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
24 If [[H518]] a man [[H376]] lies with [[H7901]] her [[H7901]] and her menstrual flow [[H5079]] touches [[H1961]] him, [[H5921]] he will be unclean [[H2930]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and any [[H3605]] bed [[H4904]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] he lies [[H7901]] will become unclean. [[H2930]] 
25 When [[H3588]] a woman [[H802]] has a discharge [[H2100]] of her blood [[H1818]] for many [[H7227]] days [[H3117]] at a time [[H6256]] other than [[H3808]] her menstrual period, [[H5079]] or [[H176]] if [[H3588]] it continues [[H2100]] beyond [[H5921]] her period, [[H5079]] she [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] unclean [[H2931]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of her unclean [[H2932]] discharge, [[H2101]] just as she is during the days [[H3117]] of her menstruation. [[H5079]] 
26 Any [[H3605]] bed [[H4904]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] she lies [[H7901]] or any [[H3605]] furniture [[H3627]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] she sits [[H3427]] during the days [[H3117]] of her discharge [[H2101]] will be [[H1961]] unclean, [[H2931]] like her bed [[H4904]] during her menstrual period. [[H2932]] 
27 Anyone [[H3605]] who touches [[H5060]] these things  will be unclean; [[H2930]] he must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
28 When [[H518]] [a woman] is cleansed [[H2891]] of her discharge, [[H2101]] she must count off [[H5608]] seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and after that [[H310]] she will be clean. [[H2891]] 
29 On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] she is to take [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] turtledoves [[H8449]] or [[H176]] two [[H8147]] young [[H1121]] pigeons [[H3123]] and bring [[H935]] them to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
30 The priest [[H3548]] is to sacrifice [[H6213]] one [[H259]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] and the other [[H259]] as a burnt offering. [[H5930]] In this way the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] her before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3069]] for her unclean [[H2932]] discharge. [[H2101]] 
31 You must keep [[H5144]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel {separate} [[H3478]] from their uncleanness, [[H2932]] so that they do not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] by defiling [[H2930]] My tabernacle [[H4908]] that [[H834]] is among them. [[H8432]] 
32 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of him who has a discharge, [[H2100]] of the man who [[H834]] has [[H3318]] a seminal [[H2233]] emission [[H7902]] whereby  he is unclean, [[H2930]] 
33 of a woman [[H1739]] in her menstrual period, [[H5079]] of any male [[H2145]] or female [[H5347]] who has a discharge, [[H2100]] and of a man [[H376]] who [[H834]] lies [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] an unclean woman.” [[H2931]]
