1 If [[H518]] one’s offering [[H7133]] [is] a peace offering [[H8002]] and he [[H1931]] offers [[H7126]] an animal from [[H4480]] the herd, [[H1241]] whether [[H518]] male [[H2145]] or [[H518]] female, [[H5347]] he must present [[H7126]] it without blemish [[H8549]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 He is to lay [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the offering [[H7133]] and slaughter [[H7819]] it at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] Then Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] the priests [[H3548]] shall sprinkle [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] on all sides [[H5439]] of [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
3 From the peace offering, [[H8002]] he is to bring [[H7126]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] the fat [[H2459]] surrounding [[H3680]] the entrails, [[H7130]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] that [[H834]] is on [[H5921]] the entrails, [[H7130]] 
4 both [[H8147]] kidneys [[H3629]] with the fat [[H2459]] on them [[H5921]] near [[H5921]] the loins, [[H3689]] and [[H853]] the lobe [[H3508]] of [[H5921]] the liver, [[H3516]] which he shall also remove [[H5493]] with [[H5921]] the kidneys. [[H3629]] 
5 Then Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] are to burn [[H6999]] it [[H853]] on the altar [[H4196]] atop [[H5921]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] that [[H834]] is on [[H5921]] the burning [[H784]] wood, [[H6086]] as an offering made by fire, [[H801]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
6 If, however, [[H518]] one’s peace offering [[H8002]] to the LORD [[H3069]] is from [[H4480]] the flock, [[H6629]] he must present [[H7126]] a male [[H2145]] or [[H176]] female [[H5347]] without blemish. [[H8549]] 
7 If [[H518]] he [[H1931]] is presenting [[H7126]] a lamb [[H3775]] for his offering, [[H7133]] he must present [[H7126]] it before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
8 He is to lay [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of his offering [[H7133]] and slaughter [[H7819]] it [[H853]] in front of [[H6440]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] Then Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] shall sprinkle [[H2236]] its blood [[H1818]] on all sides [[H5439]] of [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
9 And from the peace offering [[H8002]] he shall bring [[H7126]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD [[H3068]] consisting of its fat: [[H2459]] the entire [[H8549]] fat tail [[H451]] cut off [[H5493]] close to [[H5980]] the backbone, [[H6096]] the fat [[H2459]] surrounding [[H3680]] the entrails, [[H7130]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] on [[H5921]] the entrails, [[H7130]] 
10 both [[H8147]] kidneys [[H3629]] with the fat [[H2459]] on them [[H5921]] near [[H5921]] the loins, [[H3689]] and [[H853]] the lobe [[H3508]] of [[H5921]] the liver, [[H3516]] which he shall remove [[H5493]] with [[H5921]] the kidneys. [[H3629]] 
11 Then the priest [[H3548]] is to burn them [[H6999]] on the altar [[H4196]] as food, [[H3899]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 If [[H518]] one’s offering [[H7133]] is a goat, [[H5795]] he is to present [[H7126]] it before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 He must lay [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] its head [[H7218]] and slaughter [[H7819]] it [[H853]] in front of [[H6440]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] Then Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] shall sprinkle [[H2236]] its blood [[H1818]] on all sides [[H5439]] of [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
14 And from [[H4480]] his offering [[H7133]] he shall present [[H7126]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] the fat [[H2459]] surrounding [[H3680]] the entrails, [[H7130]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] that [[H834]] is on [[H5921]] [them], [[H7130]] 
15 both [[H8147]] kidneys [[H3629]] with the fat [[H2459]] on them [[H5921]] near [[H5921]] the loins, [[H3689]] and [[H853]] the lobe [[H3508]] of [[H5921]] the liver, [[H3516]] which he will also remove [[H5493]] with [[H5921]] the kidneys. [[H3629]] 
16 Then the priest [[H3548]] will burn [[H6999]] the food [[H3899]] on the altar [[H4196]] as an offering made by fire, [[H801]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma. [[H7381]] All [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] [is] the LORD’s. [[H3068]] 
17 This is a perpetual [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the generations to come, [[H1755]] wherever [[H3605]] you live: [[H4186]] You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] fat [[H2459]] or any [[H3605]] blood.’” [[H1818]]
