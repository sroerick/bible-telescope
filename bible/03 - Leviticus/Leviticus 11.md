1 The LORD [[H3068]] spoke again [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] saying, [[H559]] 
2 “Say [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘Of all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H929]] of [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] you may eat [[H398]] 
3 any [[H3605]] animal [[H929]] with split [[H8156]] hooves [[H6541]] and that chews [[H5927]] the cud. [[H1625]] 
4 But [[H389]] of those [[H853]] that chew [[H5927]] the cud [[H1625]] or have split [[H6536]] hooves, [[H6541]] you are not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] the following: [[H2088]] The camel, [[H1581]] though [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] chews [[H5927]] the cud, [[H1625]] does not [[H369]] have a split [[H6536]] hoof; [[H6541]] it [[H1931]] is unclean [[H2931]] for you.  
5 The rock badger, [[H8227]] though [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] chews [[H5927]] the cud, [[H1625]] does not [[H3808]] have a split [[H6536]] hoof; [[H6541]] it [[H1931]] is unclean [[H2931]] for you.  
6 The rabbit, [[H768]] though [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] chews [[H5927]] the cud, [[H1625]] does not [[H3808]] have a split [[H6536]] hoof; [[H6541]] it [[H1931]] is unclean [[H2931]] for you.  
7 And [[H853]] the pig, [[H2386]] though [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] has a split [[H8156]] hoof, [[H6541]] does not [[H3808]] chew [[H1641]] the cud; [[H1625]] it [is] [[H1931]] unclean [[H2931]] for you.  
8 You must not eat [[H398]] their meat [[H1320]] or touch [[H5060]] their carcasses; [[H5038]] they [[H1992]] are unclean for you. [[H2931]] 
9 Of all [the creatures] [[H3605]] that [live] [[H834]] in the water, [[H4325]] whether salt water [[H3220]] or fresh water, [[H5158]] you may eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] that [[H834]] have fins [[H5579]] and scales. [[H7193]] 
10 But the following [[H1992]] among all [[H3605]] the teeming [[H8318]] life [[H2416]] and creatures [[H5315]] in the water [[H4325]] are detestable [[H8263]] to you:  everything [[H3605]] in the seas [[H3220]] or streams [[H5158]] that [[H834]] does not [[H369]] have fins [[H5579]] and scales. [[H7193]] 
11 They shall be [[H1961]] an abomination [[H8263]] to you;  you must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] their meat, [[H1320]] and you must detest [[H8262]] their carcasses. [[H5038]] 
12 Everything [[H3605]] in the water [[H4325]] that [[H834]] does not [[H369]] have fins [[H5579]] and scales [[H7193]] shall be detestable [[H8263]] to you.  
13 Additionally, [[H853]] you are to detest [[H8262]] the following [[H428]] birds, [[H5775]] and they must not [[H3808]] be eaten [[H398]] because they [[H1992]] are detestable: [[H8263]] the eagle, [[H5404]] the bearded vulture, [[H6538]] the black vulture, [[H5822]] 
14 the kite, [[H1676]] and [[H853]] any kind [[H4327]] of falcon; [[H344]] 
15 every [[H3605]] kind [[H4327]] of raven; [[H6158]] 
16 the ostrich, [[H1323]] the night hawk, [[H8464]] the gull, [[H7828]] and [[H853]] any kind [[H4327]] of hawk; [[H5322]] 
17 the little owl, [[H3563]] the cormorant, [[H7994]] the great owl, [[H3244]] 
18 the white owl, [[H8580]] the desert owl, [[H6893]] the osprey, [[H7360]] 
19 the stork, [[H2624]] and any kind [[H4327]] of heron; [[H601]] the hoopoe [[H1744]] and the bat. [[H5847]] 
20 All [[H3605]] flying [[H5775]] insects [[H8318]] that walk [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] [all] fours [[H702]] are detestable [[H8263]] to you.  
21 However, [[H389]] you may eat [[H398]] the following [[H2088]] kinds of [[H3605]] winged [[H5775]] creatures [[H8318]] that walk [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] all fours: [[H702]] those having jointed legs [[H3767]] above [[H4605]] their feet [[H7272]] for hopping [[H5425]] on [[H5921]] the ground— [[H776]] 
22 any kind [[H4327]] of locust, [[H697]] katydid, [[H5556]] cricket, [[H2728]] or grasshopper. [[H2284]] 
23 All [[H3605]] other winged [[H5775]] creatures [[H8318]] that [[H834]] have four [[H702]] legs [[H7272]] are detestable to you. [[H8263]] 
24 These [creatures] [[H428]] will make you unclean. [[H2930]] Whoever [[H3605]] touches [[H5060]] their carcasses [[H5038]] will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] 
25 and whoever [[H3605]] picks up [[H5375]] one of their carcasses [[H5038]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
26 All [[H3605]] animals [[H929]] that [[H834]] have hooves [[H6541]] that are split [[H6536]] but not [[H369]] completely divided [[H8157]] and do not [[H369]] chew [[H5927]] the cud [[H1625]] are unclean for you. [[H2931]] Whoever touches [[H5060]] them  will be unclean. [[H2930]] 
27 All [[H3605]] the four-footed [[H1980]] animals [[H2416]] that walk [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] their paws [[H3709]] are unclean for you; [[H2931]] whoever [[H3605]] touches [[H5060]] their carcasses [[H5038]] will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] 
28 and anyone who picks up [[H5375]] a carcass [[H5038]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] They [[H1992]] are unclean for you. [[H2931]] 
29 The following [[H2088]] creatures [[H8318]] that move [[H8317]] along [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] are unclean for you: [[H2931]] the mole, [[H2467]] the mouse, [[H5909]] any kind [[H4327]] of great lizard, [[H6632]] 
30 the gecko, [[H604]] the monitor lizard, [[H3581]] the common lizard, [[H3911]] the skink, [[H2546]] and the chameleon. [[H8580]] 
31 These [animals] [[H428]] are unclean [[H2931]] for you among all [[H3605]] the crawling creatures. [[H8318]] Whoever [[H3605]] touches [[H5060]] them  when they are dead [[H4194]] shall be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
32 When [[H3605]] one of [[H834]] them dies [[H4194]] and falls [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] something, [[H1992]] it becomes unclean; [[H2930]] any [[H3605]] article [[H3627]] of wood, [[H6086]] clothing, [[H899]] leather, [[H5785]] sackcloth, [[H8242]] or any [[H3605]] implement [[H3627]] used [[H6213]] for work [[H4399]] must be rinsed with water [[H4325]] and will remain unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening; [[H6153]] then it will be clean. [[H2891]] 
33 If any of them [[H1992]] falls [[H5307]] into [[H413]] a [[H3605]] clay [[H2789]] pot, [[H3627]] everything [[H3605]] in [[H8432]] it will be unclean; [[H2930]] you must break [the pot]. [[H7665]] 
34 Any [[H3605]] edible [[H398]] food [[H400]] coming [[H935]] into contact [[H5921]] with water [from that pot] [[H4325]] will be unclean, [[H2930]] and anything [[H3605]] drinkable [[H8354]] in such a [[H3605]] container [[H3627]] will be unclean. [[H2930]] 
35 Anything [[H3605]] upon which [[H834]] one of their carcasses [[H5038]] falls [[H5307]] will be unclean. [[H2930]] If it is an oven [[H8574]] or cooking pot, [[H3600]] it must be smashed; [[H5422]] it [[H1992]] is unclean [[H2931]] and will remain [[H1961]] unclean [[H2931]] for you.  
36 Nevertheless, [[H389]] a spring [[H4599]] or cistern [[H953]] containing [[H4723]] water [[H4325]] will remain [[H1961]] clean, [[H2889]] but one who touches [[H5060]] a carcass in it [[H5038]] will be unclean. [[H2930]] 
37 If [[H3588]] a carcass [[H5038]] falls [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] any [[H3605]] seed [[H2233]] for sowing, [[H2221]] [the seed] [[H1931]] is clean; [[H2889]] 
38 but if [[H3588]] water [[H4325]] has been put [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] the seed [[H2233]] and a carcass [[H5038]] falls [[H5307]] on it, [[H5921]] it [[H1931]] is unclean [[H2931]] for you.  
39 If [[H3588]] an [[H4480]] animal [[H929]] that [[H834]] you  may eat [[H402]] dies, [[H4191]] anyone who touches [[H5060]] the carcass [[H5038]] will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
40 Anyone who eats [[H398]] from the carcass [[H5038]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] and anyone who picks up [[H5375]] the carcass [[H5038]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] 
41 Every [[H3605]] creature [[H8318]] that moves [[H8317]] along [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] is detestable; [[H8263]] it [[H1931]] must not [[H3808]] be eaten. [[H398]] 
42 Do not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] creature [[H8318]] that moves [[H8317]] along [[H5921]] the ground, [[H776]] whether [[H3605]] it crawls [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] its belly [[H1512]] or walks [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] four [[H702]] or [[H5704]] more [[H7235]] feet; [[H7272]] for [[H3588]] such [creatures] [[H1992]] are detestable. [[H8263]] 
43 Do not [[H408]] defile [[H8262]] yourselves [[H5315]] by any [[H3605]] crawling creature; [[H8318]] do not [[H3808]] become unclean [[H2930]] or defiled [[H2933]] by them.  
44 For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] consecrate yourselves therefore, [[H6942]] and be [[H1961]] holy, [[H6918]] because [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am holy. [[H6918]] You must not [[H3808]] defile [[H2930]] yourselves [[H5315]] by any [[H3605]] creature [[H8318]] that crawls [[H7430]] along [[H5921]] the ground. [[H776]] 
45 For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] who brought you up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to be [[H1961]] your God; [[H430]] therefore be [[H1961]] holy, [[H6918]] because [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am holy. [[H6918]] 
46 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] regarding animals, [[H929]] birds, [[H5775]] all [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creatures [[H5315]] that move [[H7430]] in the water, [[H4325]] and all [[H3605]] creatures [[H5315]] that crawl [[H8317]] along [[H5921]] the ground. [[H776]] 
47 You must distinguish [[H914]] between [[H996]] the unclean [[H2931]] and the clean, [[H2889]] between [[H996]] animals [[H2416]] that may be eaten [[H398]] and those [[H2416]] that [[H834]] may not.” [[H3808]]
