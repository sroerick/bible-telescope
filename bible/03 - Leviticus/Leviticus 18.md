1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] [and] tell [[H559]] them, [[H413]] ‘I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
3 You shall not follow [[H6213]] the practices [[H4639]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] where [[H834]] you used to live, [[H3427]] [or] [[H6213]] the practices [[H4639]] of the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] where [[H834]] I [[H589]] am bringing you. [[H935]] You must not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in their customs. [[H2708]] 
4 You are to practice [[H6213]] My judgments [[H4941]] and keep [[H8104]] My statutes [[H2708]] by walking [[H1980]] in them.  I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
5 Keep [[H8104]] My statutes [[H2708]] and [[H853]] My judgments, [[H4941]] [for] [[H834]] the man [[H120]] who does these things [[H6213]] will live [[H2425]] by them.  I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
6 None of [[H376]] you are to approach [[H7126]] any [[H3605]] close relative [[H7607]] to have sexual relations. [[H1540]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3069]] 
7 You must not [[H3808]] expose the nakedness [[H6172]] of your father [[H1]] by having sexual relations with [[H1540]] your mother. [[H517]] She [[H1931]] is your mother; [[H517]] you must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H1540]] her. [[H6172]] 
8 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H6172]] your father’s [[H1]] wife; [[H802]] it [[H1931]] would dishonor [[H6172]] your father. [[H1]] 
9 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H1540]] your sister, [[H269]] either your father’s [[H1]] daughter [[H1323]] or [[H176]] your mother’s daughter, [[H517]] whether she was born [[H4138]] in the same home [[H1004]] or [[H176]] elsewhere. [[H2351]] 
10 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H1540]] your son’s [[H1121]] daughter [[H1323]] or [[H176]] your daughter’s [[H1323]] daughter, [[H1323]] for [[H3588]] that [[H2007]] would shame your family. [[H6172]] 
11 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H6172]] the daughter [[H1323]] of your father’s [[H1]] wife, [[H802]] born [[H4138]] to your father; [[H1]] she [[H1931]] is your sister. [[H269]] 
12 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H6172]] your father’s [[H1]] sister; [[H269]] she [[H1931]] is your father’s [[H1]] close relative. [[H7607]] 
13 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H6172]] your mother’s [[H517]] sister, [[H269]] for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] is your mother’s [[H517]] close relative. [[H7607]] 
14 You must not [[H3808]] dishonor [[H6172]] your father’s [[H1]] brother [[H251]] by approaching [[H7126]] his wife [[H802]] to have sexual relations [[H1540]] with her; [[H413]] she [is] [[H1931]] your aunt. [[H1733]] 
15 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H6172]] your daughter-in-law. [[H3618]] She [[H1931]] is your son’s [[H1121]] wife; [[H802]] you are not [[H3808]] to have sexual relations with [[H1540]] her. [[H6172]] 
16 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H6172]] your brother’s [[H251]] wife; [[H802]] that [[H1931]] would shame [[H6172]] your brother. [[H251]] 
17 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with both [[H6172]] a woman [[H802]] and her daughter. [[H1323]] You are not [[H3808]] to marry [[H3947]] her son’s [[H1121]] daughter [[H1323]] or her daughter’s [[H1323]] daughter [[H1323]] and have sexual relations with [[H1540]] her. [[H6172]] They [[H2007]] are close relatives; [[H7608]] it [[H1931]] is depraved. [[H2154]] 
18 You must not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] your wife’s [[H802]] sister [[H269]] as a rival wife [[H6887]] and have sexual relations [[H1540]] with her [[H5921]] while your wife is still alive. [[H2416]] 
19 You must not [[H3808]] approach [[H7126]] a woman [[H802]] to have sexual relations with [[H1540]] her [[H6172]] during her menstrual period. [[H5079]] 
20 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations [[H5414]] with [[H413]] your neighbor’s [[H5997]] wife [[H802]] and thus defile yourself [[H2930]] with her.  
21 You must not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] any of your children [[H2233]] to be sacrificed [[H5674]] to Molech, [[H4432]] for you must not [[H3808]] profane [[H2490]] the name [[H8034]] of your God. [[H430]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
22 You must not [[H3808]] lie [[H7901]] with [[H854]] a man [[H2145]] as with [[H4904]] a woman; [[H802]] that [[H1931]] [is] an abomination. [[H8441]] 
23 You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations [[H5414]] with any [[H3605]] animal, [[H929]] thus defiling yourself [[H2930]] with it;  a woman [[H802]] must not [[H3808]] stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] an animal [[H929]] to mate with it; [[H7250]] that [[H1931]] is a perversion. [[H8397]] 
24 Do not [[H408]] defile [[H2930]] yourselves by any [[H3605]] of these practices, [[H428]] for [[H3588]] by all [[H3605]] these things [[H428]] the nations [[H1471]] I [[H589]] am driving out [[H7971]] before you [[H6440]] have defiled themselves. [[H2930]] 
25 Even the land [[H776]] has become defiled, [[H2930]] so I am punishing it [[H6485]] for its sin, [[H5771]] and the land [[H776]] will vomit out [[H6958]] its [[H853]] inhabitants. [[H3427]] 
26 But you [[H859]] are to keep [[H8104]] My statutes [[H2708]] and ordinances, [[H4941]] and you must not [[H3808]] commit [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] of these [[H428]] abominations— [[H8441]] neither your native-born [[H249]] nor the foreigner [[H1616]] who lives [[H1481]] among you. [[H8432]] 
27 For [[H3588]] the men [[H376]] who were in the land [[H776]] before you [[H6440]] committed [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H411]] abominations, [[H8441]] and the land [[H776]] has become defiled. [[H2930]] 
28 So if you defile [[H2930]] the land, [[H776]] it will vomit you out [[H6958]] as [[H834]] it spewed out [[H6958]] the nations [[H1471]] before you. [[H6440]] 
29 Therefore [[H3588]] anyone [[H3605]] who [[H834]] commits [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] of these [[H428]] abominations [[H8441]] must be cut off [[H3772]] from among [[H7130]] his people. [[H5971]] 
30 You must keep [[H8104]] My charge [[H4931]] not [[H1115]] to practice [[H6213]] [any] of the abominable [[H8441]] customs [[H2708]] that [[H834]] were practiced [[H6213]] before you, [[H6440]] so that you do not [[H3808]] defile yourselves [[H2930]] by them.  I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]]
