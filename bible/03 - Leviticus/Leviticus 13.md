# Leviticus 13
[[Leviticus 12|←]] • [[Leviticus 14|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] 
2 “When [[H3588]] someone [[H120]] has [[H1961]] a swelling [[H7613]] or rash [[H5597]] or [[H176]] bright spot [[H934]] on his skin [[H5785]] that could become [[H1961]] an infectious skin disease, [[H6883]] he must be brought [[H935]] to [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] or [[H176]] to [[H413]] one [[H259]] of his sons [[H1121]] who is a priest. [[H3548]] 
3 The priest [[H3548]] is to examine [[H7200]] the infection [[H5061]] on his skin, [[H5785]] and if the hair [[H8181]] in the infection [[H5061]] has turned [[H2015]] white [[H3836]] and the sore [[H5061]] appears [[H4758]] to be deeper [[H6013]] than the skin, [[H5785]] it [[H1931]] is a skin disease. [[H6883]] After the priest [[H3548]] examines him, [[H7200]] he must pronounce him unclean. [[H2930]] 
4 If, however, [[H518]] the spot [[H934]] on his skin [[H5785]] is white [[H3836]] and does not [[H369]] appear [[H4758]] to be deeper [[H6013]] than [[H4480]] the skin, [[H5785]] and the hair in it [[H8181]] has not [[H3808]] turned [[H2015]] white, [[H3836]] the priest [[H3548]] shall quarantine [[H5462]] the infected person [[H5061]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
5 On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the priest [[H3548]] is to reexamine him, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] he sees [[H5869]] that the infection [[H5061]] is unchanged [[H5975]] and has not [[H3808]] spread [[H6581]] on the skin, [[H5785]] the priest [[H3548]] must isolate [[H5462]] him for another [[H8145]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
6 The priest [[H3548]] will examine [[H7200]] him again [[H8145]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] and if [[H2009]] the sore [[H5061]] has faded [[H3544]] and has not [[H3808]] spread [[H6581]] on the skin, [[H5785]] the priest [[H3548]] shall pronounce him clean; [[H2891]] it [[H1931]] is a rash. [[H4556]] The person must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and be clean. [[H2891]] 
7 But if [[H518]] the rash [[H4556]] spreads [[H6581]] further on his skin [[H5785]] after [[H310]] he has shown [[H7200]] himself to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] for his cleansing, [[H2893]] he must present [[H7200]] himself again [[H8145]] to [[H413]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
8 The priest [[H3548]] will examine him, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] the rash [[H4556]] has spread [[H6581]] on the skin, [[H5785]] then the priest [[H3548]] must pronounce him unclean; [[H2930]] he [[H1931]] has a skin disease. [[H6883]] 
9 When [[H3588]] anyone [[H120]] develops [[H1961]] a skin disease, [[H5061]] he must be brought [[H935]] to [[H413]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
10 The priest [[H3548]] will examine him, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] there is a white [[H3836]] swelling [[H7613]] on the skin [[H5785]] that [[H1931]] has turned [[H2015]] the hair [[H8181]] white, [[H3836]] and there is raw [[H2416]] flesh [[H1320]] in the swelling, [[H7613]] 
11 it [[H1931]] is a chronic [[H3462]] skin disease [[H6883]] and the priest [[H3548]] must pronounce him unclean. [[H2930]] He need not [[H3808]] quarantine him, [[H5462]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is unclean. [[H2931]] 
12 But if [[H518]] the skin disease [[H6883]] breaks out [[H6524]] all over his skin [[H5785]] so that it [[H6883]] covers [[H3680]] all [[H3605]] the skin [[H5785]] of the infected person [[H5061]] from head [[H7218]] to [[H5704]] foot, [[H7272]] as far as the priest [[H3548]] can see, [[H4758]] 
13 the priest [[H3548]] shall examine him, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] the disease [[H6883]] has covered [[H3680]] his entire [[H3605]] body, [[H1320]] he is to pronounce the infected person [[H5061]] clean. [[H2891]] Since it has all turned [[H2015]] white, [[H3836]] he [[H1931]] is clean. [[H2889]] 
14 But whenever [[H3117]] raw [[H2416]] flesh [[H1320]] appears [[H7200]] on him,  he will be unclean. [[H2930]] 
15 When the priest [[H3548]] sees [[H7200]] the raw [[H2416]] flesh, [[H1320]] he must pronounce him unclean. [[H2930]] The raw [[H2416]] flesh [[H1320]] is unclean; [[H2931]] it [[H1931]] is a skin disease. [[H6883]] 
16 But [[H176]] if [[H3588]] the raw [[H2416]] flesh [[H1320]] changes [[H7725]] and turns [[H2015]] white, [[H3836]] he must go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
17 The priest [[H3548]] will examine him, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] the infection [[H5061]] has turned [[H2015]] white, [[H3836]] the priest [[H3548]] is to pronounce the infected person [[H5061]] clean; [[H2891]] then he [[H1931]] is clean. [[H2889]] 
18 When [[H3588]] a boil [[H7822]] appears [[H1961]] on someone’s skin [[H5785]] and it heals, [[H7495]] 
19 and a white [[H3836]] swelling [[H7613]] or [[H176]] a reddish-white [[H3836]] spot [[H934]] develops [[H1961]] where [[H4725]] the boil was, [[H7822]] he must present himself [[H7200]] to [[H413]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
20 The priest [[H3548]] shall examine it, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] it appears [[H4758]] to be beneath [[H8217]] the skin [[H5785]] and the hair in it [[H8181]] has turned [[H2015]] white, [[H3836]] the priest [[H3548]] shall pronounce him unclean; [[H2930]] it [[H1931]] is a diseased infection [[H6883]] that has broken out [[H6524]] in the boil. [[H7822]] 
21 But when [[H518]] the priest [[H3548]] examines it, [[H7200]] if [[H2009]] there is no [[H369]] white [[H3836]] hair in it, [[H8181]] and it is not [[H369]] beneath [[H8217]] the skin [[H5785]] and has faded, [[H3544]] the priest [[H3548]] shall isolate him [[H5462]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
22 If [[H518]] it spreads [[H6581]] any [[H6581]] further on the skin, [[H5785]] the priest [[H3548]] must pronounce him unclean; [[H2930]] it [[H1931]] is an infection. [[H5061]] 
23 But if [[H518]] the spot [[H934]] remains [[H5975]] unchanged [[H8478]] and does not [[H3808]] spread, [[H6581]] it [[H1931]] is only the scar [[H6867]] from the boil, [[H7822]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall pronounce him clean. [[H2891]] 
24 When [[H3588]] there is [[H1961]] a burn [[H4348]] on someone’s skin [[H5785]] and the raw [[H4241]] [area] of the burn [[H4348]] becomes [[H1961]] reddish-white [[H3836]] or [[H176]] white, [[H3836]] 
25 the priest [[H3548]] must examine it. [[H7200]] If [[H2009]] the hair [[H8181]] in the spot [[H934]] has turned [[H2015]] white [[H3836]] and the spot appears [[H4758]] to be deeper [[H6013]] than [[H4480]] the skin, [[H5785]] it [[H1931]] is a disease [[H6883]] that has broken out [[H6524]] in the burn. [[H4348]] The priest [[H3548]] must pronounce him unclean; [[H2930]] it [[H1931]] is a diseased infection. [[H6883]] 
26 But if [[H518]] the priest [[H3548]] examines it [[H7200]] and there is [[H2009]] no [[H369]] white [[H3836]] hair [[H8181]] in the spot, [[H934]] and it is not [[H369]] beneath [[H8217]] the skin [[H5785]] but has faded, [[H3544]] the priest [[H3548]] shall isolate him [[H5462]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
27 On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the priest [[H3548]] is to reexamine him, [[H7200]] and if [[H518]] it has spread [[H6581]] further on the skin, [[H5785]] the priest [[H3548]] must pronounce him unclean; [[H2930]] it [[H1931]] is a diseased infection. [[H6883]] 
28 But if [[H518]] the spot [[H934]] is unchanged [[H5975]] and has not [[H3808]] spread [[H6581]] on the skin [[H5785]] but has faded, [[H3544]] it [[H1931]] is a swelling [[H7613]] from the burn, [[H4348]] and the priest [[H3548]] is to pronounce him clean; [[H2891]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is only the scar [[H6867]] from the burn. [[H4348]] 
29 If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] or [[H176]] woman [[H802]] has [[H1961]] an infection [[H5061]] on the head [[H7218]] or [[H176]] chin, [[H2206]] 
30 the priest [[H3548]] shall examine [[H7200]] the infection, [[H5061]] and if [[H2009]] it appears [[H4758]] to be deeper [[H6013]] than [[H4480]] the skin [[H5785]] and  the hair in it [[H8181]] is yellow [[H6669]] and thin, [[H1851]] the priest [[H3548]] must pronounce him unclean; [[H2930]] it [[H1931]] is a scaly outbreak, [[H5424]] an infectious disease [[H6883]] of the head [[H7218]] or [[H176]] chin. [[H2206]] 
31 But if [[H3588]] the priest [[H3548]] examines [[H7200]] the scaly [[H5424]] infection [[H5061]] and [[H2009]] it does not [[H369]] appear [[H4758]] to be deeper [[H6013]] than [[H4480]] the skin, [[H5785]] and there is no [[H369]] black [[H7838]] hair [[H8181]] in it,  the priest [[H3548]] shall isolate [[H5462]] the infected person [[H5424]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
32 On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the priest [[H3548]] is to reexamine [[H7200]] the infection, [[H5061]] and if [[H2009]] the scaly outbreak [[H5424]] has not [[H3808]] spread [[H6581]] and there is [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] yellow [[H6669]] hair [[H8181]] in it,  and it [[H5424]] does not [[H369]] appear [[H4758]] to be deeper [[H6013]] than [[H4480]] the skin, [[H5785]] 
33 then the person must shave himself [[H1548]] except for [[H853]] the scaly area. [[H5424]] Then the priest [[H3548]] shall isolate [[H5462]] [him] [[H5424]] for another [[H8145]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
34 On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the priest [[H3548]] shall examine [[H7200]] the scaly outbreak, [[H5424]] and if [[H2009]] it [[H5424]] has not [[H3808]] spread [[H6581]] on the skin [[H5785]] and does not [[H369]] appear to be [[H4758]] deeper [[H6013]] than [[H4480]] the skin, [[H5785]] the priest [[H3548]] is to pronounce him clean. [[H2891]] He must wash [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] and he will be clean. [[H2891]] 
35 If, however, [[H518]] the scaly outbreak [[H5424]] spreads [[H6581]] further [[H6581]] on the skin [[H5785]] after [[H310]] his cleansing, [[H2893]] 
36 the priest [[H3548]] is to examine him, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] the scaly outbreak [[H5424]] has spread [[H6581]] on the skin, [[H5785]] the priest [[H3548]] need not [[H3808]] look for [[H1239]] yellow [[H6669]] hair; [[H8181]] the person [[H1931]] is unclean. [[H2931]] 
37 But if [[H518]] in his sight [[H5869]] the scaly outbreak [[H5424]] is unchanged [[H5975]] and black [[H7838]] hair [[H8181]] has grown [[H6779]] in it,  then it [[H5424]] has healed. [[H7495]] He [[H1931]] is clean, [[H2889]] and the priest [[H3548]] is to pronounce him [clean]. [[H2891]] 
38 When [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] or [[H176]] a woman [[H802]] has white [[H3836]] spots [[H934]] on the skin, [[H5785]] 
39 the priest [[H3548]] shall examine them, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] the spots [[H934]] are dull [[H3544]] white, [[H3836]] it [[H1931]] is a harmless rash [[H933]] that has broken out [[H6524]] on the skin; [[H5785]] the person [[H1931]] is clean. [[H2889]] 
40 Now if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] loses his hair [[H4803]] [and] is bald, [[H7142]] he is still [[H1931]] clean. [[H2889]] 
41 Or if [[H518]] his hairline [[H6285]] recedes [[H4803]] and he [[H1931]] is bald on his forehead, [[H1371]] he is still [[H1931]] clean. [[H2889]] 
42 But if [[H3588]] there is [[H1961]] a reddish-white [[H3836]] sore [[H5061]] on the bald head [[H7146]] or [[H176]] forehead, [[H1372]] it [[H1931]] is an infectious disease [[H6883]] breaking out [[H6524]] [on it]. [[H7146]] 
43 The priest [[H3548]] is to examine him, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] the swelling [[H7613]] of the infection [[H5061]] on his bald head [[H7146]] or [[H176]] forehead [[H1372]] is reddish-white [[H3836]] like [[H4758]] a skin [[H5785]] disease, [[H6883]] 
44 the man [[H376]] is diseased; [[H6879]] he [[H1931]] is unclean. [[H2931]] The priest [[H3548]] must pronounce him unclean [[H2930]] because of the infection [[H5061]] on his head. [[H7218]] 
45 The diseased person [[H5061]] must wear torn clothes [[H899]] and let his hair [[H7218]] hang loose, [[H6544]] and he must cover [[H5844]] his mouth [[H8222]] and cry out, [[H7121]] ‘Unclean, [[H2931]] unclean!’ [[H2931]] 
46 As [[H3605]] long as [[H3117]] he has the infection, [[H5061]] he remains [[H2930]] unclean. [[H2931]] He must live alone [[H3427]] in a place [[H4186]] outside [[H2351]] the camp. [[H4264]] 
47 If [[H3588]] any fabric [[H899]] is [[H1961]] contaminated [[H5061]] with mildew— [[H6883]] any wool [[H6785]] or [[H176]] linen [[H6593]] garment, [[H899]] 
48 any weave [[H8359]] or [[H176]] knit [[H6154]] of linen [[H6593]] or wool, [[H6785]] or [[H176]] any article of leather— [[H5785]] 
49 and if the mark [[H5061]] in the fabric, [[H899]] leather, [[H5785]] weave, [[H8359]] knit, [[H6154]] or [[H176]] leather [[H5785]] article [[H3627]] is [[H1961]] green [[H3422]] or [[H176]] red, [[H125]] then it is [[H1931]] contaminated [[H5061]] with mildew [[H6883]] and must be shown [[H7200]] to the priest. [[H3548]] 
50 And the priest [[H3548]] is to examine [[H7200]] the mildew [[H5061]] and isolate [[H5462]] the contaminated [fabric] [[H5061]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
51 On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the priest shall reexamine [[H7200]] it, [[H853]] and if [[H3588]] the mildew [[H5061]] has spread [[H6581]] in the fabric, [[H899]] weave, [[H8359]] knit, [[H6154]] or [[H176]] leather, [[H5785]] then regardless of [[H3605]] how [[H834]] it [[H5785]] is used, [[H6213]] [it] [[H5061]] is a harmful [[H3992]] mildew; [[H6883]] [the article] [[H1931]] is unclean. [[H2931]] 
52 He is to burn [[H8313]] the fabric, [[H899]] weave, [[H8359]] or [[H176]] knit, [[H6154]] whether [[H176]] the contaminated item [is] [[H5061]] wool [[H6785]] or linen [[H6593]] or [[H176]] leather. [[H5785]] Since [[H3588]] the mildew [[H6883]] is harmful, [[H3992]] [the article] [[H1931]] must be burned up. [[H784]] 
53 But when [[H518]] the priest [[H3548]] examines it, [[H7200]] if [[H2009]] the mildew [[H5061]] has not [[H3808]] spread [[H6581]] in the garment, [[H899]] weave, [[H8359]] knit, [[H6154]] or [[H176]] leather [[H5785]] article, [[H3627]] 
54 the priest [[H3548]] is to order [[H6680]] the [[H834]] contaminated [article] [[H5061]] to be washed [[H3526]] and isolated [[H5462]] for another [[H8145]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] 
55 After [[H310]] it has been washed, [[H3526]] the priest [[H3548]] is to reexamine it, [[H7200]] and if [[H2009]] the mildewed [[H5061]] article [[H5061]] has not [[H3808]] changed [[H2015]] in appearance, [[H5869]] it [[H1931]] is unclean. [[H2931]] Even though the mildew [[H5061]] has not [[H3808]] spread, [[H6581]] you must burn up [[H784]] the fabric, [[H8313]] whether [[H1931]] the rot is [[H6356]] on the front [[H1372]] or [[H176]] back. [[H7146]] 
56 If [[H518]] the priest [[H3548]] examines it [[H7200]] and the mildew [[H5061]] has faded [[H3544]] after [[H310]] it has been washed, [[H3526]] he must cut the contaminated section out [[H7167]] of [[H4480]] the fabric, [[H899]] leather, [[H5785]] weave, [[H8359]] or [[H176]] knit. [[H6154]] 
57 But if [[H518]] it reappears [[H7200]] in the fabric, [[H899]] weave [[H8359]] or [[H176]] knit, [[H6154]] or [[H176]] on any [[H3605]] leather [[H5785]] article, [[H3627]] it [[H1931]] is spreading. [[H6524]] You must burn up [[H784]] the contaminated [[H5061]] article. [[H834]] 
58 If the mildew [[H5061]] disappears [[H5493]] from [[H1992]] the fabric, [[H899]] weave [[H8359]] or [[H176]] knit, [[H6154]] or [[H176]] any [[H3605]] leather [[H5785]] article [[H3627]] after [[H834]] washing, [[H3526]] then it is to be washed [[H3526]] again, [[H8145]] and it will be clean. [[H2891]] 
59 This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] concerning a mildew [[H6883]] contamination [[H5061]] in wool [[H6785]] or [[H176]] linen [[H6593]] fabric, [[H899]] weave [[H8359]] or [[H176]] knit, [[H6154]] or [[H176]] any [[H3605]] leather [[H5785]] article, [[H3627]] for pronouncing it clean [[H2891]] or [[H176]] unclean.” [[H2930]]
