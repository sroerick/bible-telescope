[[Leviticus 7|←]] • [[Leviticus 9|→]]
1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
2 “Take [[H3947]] Aaron [[H175]] and [[H853]] his sons, [[H1121]] their garments, [[H899]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil, [[H8081]] the bull [[H6499]] of the sin offering, [[H2403]] the two [[H8147]] rams, [[H352]] and the basket [[H5536]] of unleavened bread, [[H4682]] 
3 and assemble [[H6950]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting.” [[H4150]] 
4 So Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded him, [[H6680]] and the assembly [[H5712]] gathered [[H6950]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
5 And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded [[H6680]] to be done.” [[H6213]] 
6 Then Moses [[H4872]] presented [[H7126]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] and washed [[H7364]] them with water. [[H4325]] 
7 He put [[H5414]] the tunic [[H3801]] on Aaron, [[H5921]] tied the sash [[H73]] around him, [[H2296]] clothed [[H3847]] him with the robe, [[H4598]] and put [[H5414]] the ephod [[H646]] on him. [[H5921]] He tied the woven band [[H2805]] of the ephod [[H646]] around [[H2296]] him [[H853]] and fastened it [[H640]] to him.  
8 Then he put [[H7760]] the breastpiece [[H2833]] on [[H5921]] him [[H853]] and placed [[H5414]] the Urim [[H224]] and Thummim [[H8550]] in [[H413]] the breastpiece. [[H2833]] 
9 [Moses] also put [[H7760]] the turban [[H4701]] on [[H5921]] [Aaron’s] head [[H7218]] and set [[H7760]] the gold [[H2091]] plate, [[H6731]] the holy [[H6944]] diadem, [[H5145]] on [[H413]] the front [[H4136]] of the turban, [[H4701]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] [him]. [[H4872]] 
10 Next, Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and anointed [[H4886]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and everything [[H3605]] in it;  and so he consecrated [[H6942]] them. [[H853]] 
11 He sprinkled [[H5137]] some of [[H4480]] the oil on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] seven [[H7651]] times, [[H6471]] anointing [[H4886]] the altar [[H4196]] and all [[H3605]] its utensils, [[H3627]] and the basin [[H3595]] with its stand, [[H3653]] to consecrate them. [[H6942]] 
12 He also poured [[H3332]] some of the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] on [[H5921]] Aaron’s [[H175]] head [[H7218]] and anointed [[H4886]] him [[H853]] to consecrate him. [[H6942]] 
13 Then Moses [[H4872]] presented [[H7126]] Aaron’s [[H175]] sons, [[H1121]] put [[H3847]] tunics on them, [[H3801]] tied sashes [[H73]] around them, [[H2296]] and fastened [[H2280]] headbands [[H4021]] on them,  just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] [him]. [[H4872]] 
14 [Moses] then brought the bull [[H6499]] near [[H5066]] for the sin offering, [[H2403]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] laid [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] its head. [[H7218]] 
15 Moses [[H4872]] slaughtered [the bull], [[H7819]] took [[H3947]] some of the blood, [[H1818]] and applied [[H5414]] it with his finger [[H676]] to [[H5921]] all [four] [[H5439]] horns [[H7161]] of the altar, [[H4196]] purifying [[H2398]] the altar. [[H4196]] He poured out [[H3332]] the rest of the blood [[H1818]] at [[H413]] the base [[H3247]] of the altar [[H4196]] and consecrated it [[H6942]] so that atonement could be made [[H3722]] on it. [[H5921]] 
16 Moses also [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] that [[H834]] was on [[H5921]] the entrails, [[H7130]] the lobe [[H3508]] of the liver, [[H3516]] and both [[H8147]] kidneys [[H3629]] and [[H853]] their fat, [[H2459]] and burned [it] [[H6999]] on the altar. [[H4196]] 
17 But [[H853]] the bull [[H6499]] with its hide, [[H5785]] flesh, [[H1320]] and dung [[H6569]] he burned [[H8313]] outside [[H2351]] the camp, [[H4264]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] [him]. [[H4872]] 
18 Then [Moses] presented [[H7126]] the ram [[H352]] for the burnt offering, [[H5930]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] laid [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] its head. [[H7218]] 
19 Moses [[H4872]] slaughtered [the ram] [[H7819]] and sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] on all sides [[H5439]] of [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
20 [He] [[H4872]] cut [[H5408]] the ram [[H352]] into pieces [[H5409]] and burned [[H6999]] the head, [[H7218]] the pieces, [[H5409]] and the fat. [[H6309]] 
21 He washed [[H7364]] the entrails [[H7130]] and legs [[H3767]] with water [[H4325]] and burned [[H6999]] the entire [[H3605]] ram [[H352]] on the altar [[H4196]] as a burnt offering, [[H5930]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma, [[H7381]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD, [[H3069]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
22 After that, [Moses] presented [[H7126]] the other [[H8145]] ram, [[H352]] the ram [[H352]] of ordination, [[H4394]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] laid [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] its head. [[H7218]] 
23 Moses [[H4872]] slaughtered [the ram] [[H7819]] and took [[H3947]] some of its blood [[H1818]] and put [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] Aaron’s [[H175]] right [[H3233]] earlobe, [[H8571]] on [[H5921]] the thumb [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] hand, [[H3027]] and on [[H5921]] the big toe [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] foot. [[H7272]] 
24 Moses [[H4872]] also presented [[H7126]] Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] and put [[H5414]] some of [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] on [[H5921]] their right [[H3233]] earlobes, [[H8571]] on [[H5921]] the thumbs [[H931]] of their right [[H3233]] hands, [[H3027]] and on [[H5921]] the big toes [[H931]] of their right [[H3233]] feet. [[H7272]] Then [he] [[H4872]] sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] on all sides [[H5439]] of [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
25 And [Moses] took [[H3947]] the fat— [[H2459]] the fat tail, [[H451]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] that [[H834]] was on [[H5921]] the entrails, [[H7130]] the lobe [[H3508]] of the liver, [[H3516]] and both [[H8147]] kidneys [[H3629]] with their [[H853]] fat— [[H2459]] as well as the right [[H3225]] thigh. [[H7785]] 
26 And from the basket [[H5536]] of unleavened bread [[H4682]] that [[H834]] was before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] he took [[H3947]] one [[H259]] cake [[H2471]] of unleavened bread, [[H4682]] one [[H259]] cake [[H2471]] of bread [[H3899]] made with oil, [[H8081]] and one [[H259]] wafer, [[H7550]] and he placed [[H7760]] them on [[H5921]] the fat portions [[H2459]] and on [[H5921]] the right [[H3225]] thigh. [[H7785]] 
27 He put [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] these in [[H5921]] the hands [[H3709]] of Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] and waved [[H5130]] them before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] as a wave offering. [[H8573]] 
28 Then Moses [[H4872]] took them [[H3947]] out of [[H5921]] their hands [[H3709]] and burned them [[H6999]] on the altar [[H4196]] with [[H5921]] the burnt offering. [[H5930]] This [[H1992]] was an ordination offering, [[H4394]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma, [[H7381]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] 
29 He also [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the breast— [[H2373]] Moses’ [[H4872]] portion [[H4490]] of the ordination [[H4394]] ram— [[H352]] and waved [[H5130]] it before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] as a wave offering, [[H8573]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H4872]] 
30 Moses next [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] some of [[H4480]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and some of the blood [[H1818]] that [[H834]] was on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] and sprinkled [[H5137]] them on [[H5921]] Aaron [[H175]] and his garments, [[H899]] and on [[H5921]] his sons [[H1121]] and their [[H1121]] garments. [[H899]] So he consecrated [[H6942]] Aaron [[H175]] and his garments, [[H899]] as well as his sons [[H1121]] and their [[H1121]] garments. [[H899]] 
31 And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons, [[H1121]] “Boil [[H1310]] the meat [[H1320]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and eat [[H398]] it [[H853]] there [[H8033]] with the bread [[H3899]] that [[H834]] is in the basket [[H5536]] of ordination offerings, [[H4394]] as [[H834]] I commanded, [[H6680]] saying, [[H559]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] are to eat it. [[H398]] 
32 Then you must burn up [[H784]] the remainder [[H3498]] of the meat [[H1320]] and bread. [[H3899]] 
33 You must not [[H3808]] go outside [[H3318]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] the days [[H3117]] of your ordination [[H4394]] are complete; [[H4390]] for [[H3588]] it will take seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] to ordain [[H4390]] you. [[H3027]] 
34 What [[H834]] has been done [[H6213]] today [[H3117]] has been commanded [[H6680]] by the LORD [[H3068]] in order to make atonement [[H3722]] on your behalf. [[H5921]] 
35 You must remain [[H3427]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] for seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] and keep [[H8104]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] charge [[H4931]] so that you will not [[H3808]] die, [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] this is what [[H3651]] I have been commanded.” [[H6680]] 
36 So Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]]
