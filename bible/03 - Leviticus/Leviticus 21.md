1 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Speak [[H559]] to [[H413]] Aaron’s [[H175]] sons, [[H1121]] the priests, [[H3548]] and tell [[H559]] them: [[H413]] ‘[A priest] is not [[H3808]] to defile himself [[H2930]] for a dead person [[H5315]] among his people, [[H5971]] 
2 except [[H3588]] for his immediate [[H7138]] family— [[H7607]] his mother, [[H517]] father, [[H1]] son, [[H1121]] daughter, [[H1323]] brother, [[H251]] 
3 or his unmarried [[H1330]] sister [[H269]] who is near [[H7138]] to him, [[H413]] since [[H834]] she has [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] husband. [[H376]] 
4 He is not [[H3808]] to defile himself [[H2930]] for those related to him by marriage, [[H1167]] and so profane himself. [[H2490]] 
5 Priests must not [[H3808]] make bald [[H7139]] spots on their heads, [[H7218]] shave off the edges [[H6285]] of their beards, [[H2206]] or make [[H8295]] cuts [[H8296]] in their bodies. [[H1320]] 
6 They must be [[H1961]] holy [[H6918]] to their God [[H430]] and not [[H3808]] profane [[H2490]] the name [[H8034]] of their God. [[H430]] For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] present [[H7126]] the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the food [[H3899]] of their God. [[H430]] So they must be [[H1961]] holy. [[H6944]] 
7 [A priest] must not [[H3808]] marry [[H3947]] a woman [[H802]] defiled [[H2491]] by prostitution [[H2181]] or [[H3808]] divorced [[H1644]] by her husband, [[H376]] for [[H3588]] [the priest] [[H1931]] is holy [[H6918]] to his God. [[H430]] 
8 You are to regard him as holy, [[H6942]] since [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] presents [[H7126]] the food [[H3899]] of your God. [[H430]] He shall be [[H1961]] holy [[H6918]] to you,  because [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD [[H3068]] who sets you apart, [[H6942]] am holy. [[H6918]] 
9 If [[H3588]] a priest’s [[H3548]] daughter [[H1323]] defiles herself [[H2490]] by prostituting herself, [[H2181]] she [[H1931]] profanes [[H2490]] her father; [[H1]] she must be burned [[H8313]] in the fire. [[H784]] 
10 The priest [[H3548]] who is highest [[H1419]] among his brothers, [[H251]] who [[H834]] has had the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] poured [[H3332]] on [[H5921]] his head [[H7218]] and has been ordained [[H4390]] to wear [[H3847]] the priestly garments, [[H899]] must not [[H3808]] dishevel [[H6544]] his hair [[H7218]] or tear [[H6533]] his garments. [[H899]] 
11 He must not [[H3808]] go [[H935]] near any [[H3605]] dead [[H4191]] body [[H5315]] or make himself unclean, [[H2930]] even for his father [[H1]] or mother. [[H517]] 
12 He must not [[H3808]] leave [[H3318]] or desecrate [[H2490]] the sanctuary [[H4720]] of his God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] the consecration [[H5145]] of the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] of his God [[H430]] is on him. [[H5921]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 The woman [[H802]] he [[H1931]] marries [[H3947]] must be a virgin. [[H1331]] 
14 He is not [[H3808]] to marry [[H3947]] a widow, [[H490]] a divorced woman, [[H1644]] or one defiled [[H2491]] by prostitution. [[H2181]] He is to marry [[H3947]] a virgin [[H1330]] from his own people, [[H5971]] 
15 so that he does not [[H3808]] defile [[H2490]] his offspring [[H2233]] among his people, [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3069]] who sanctifies him.’” [[H6942]] 
16 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] 
17 “Say [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] ‘For the generations to come, [[H1755]] none [[H3808]] of your descendants [[H2233]] who [[H834]] has [[H1961]] a physical defect [[H3971]] may approach [[H7126]] to offer [[H7126]] the food [[H3899]] of his God. [[H430]] 
18 No [[H3605]] man [[H376]] who [[H834]] has any defect [[H3971]] may approach— [[H7126]] no man [[H376]] who is blind, [[H5787]] lame, [[H6455]] disfigured, [[H2763]] or [[H176]] deformed; [[H8311]] 
19 no man [[H376]] who [[H834]] has [[H1961]] a broken [[H7667]] foot [[H7272]] or [[H176]] hand, [[H3027]] 
20 or [[H176]] who is a hunchback [[H1384]] or [[H176]] dwarf, [[H1851]] or [[H176]] who has an eye [[H5869]] defect, [[H8400]] a festering rash, [[H1618]] scabs, [[H3217]] or [[H176]] a crushed [[H4790]] testicle. [[H810]] 
21 No [[H3605]] descendant [[H2233]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] who [[H834]] has a defect [[H3971]] shall approach [[H5066]] to present [[H7126]] the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] [Since] he has a defect, [[H3971]] he is not [[H3808]] to come near [[H5066]] to offer [[H7126]] the food [[H3899]] of his God. [[H430]] 
22 He may eat [[H398]] the most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]] food [[H3899]] of his God [[H430]] as well as [[H4480]] the holy [food], [[H6944]] 
23 but [[H389]] because [[H3588]] he has a defect, [[H3971]] he must not [[H3808]] go [[H935]] near [[H413]] the curtain [[H6532]] or approach [[H5066]] the altar, [[H4196]] so as not to desecrate [[H2490]] My sanctuaries. [[H4720]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] who sanctifies them.’” [[H6942]] 
24 Moses [[H4872]] told [[H1696]] this to [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]
