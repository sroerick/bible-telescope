# Leviticus 16
[[Leviticus 15|←]] • [[Leviticus 17|→]]
1 Now the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of two [[H8147]] of Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] when they approached [[H7126]] the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses: [[H4872]] “Tell [[H1696]] your brother [[H251]] Aaron [[H175]] not [[H408]] to enter [[H935]] freely [[H3605]] into [[H413]] the Most Holy Place [[H6944]] behind [[H1004]] the veil [[H6532]] in [[H413]] front [[H6440]] of the mercy seat [[H3727]] on [[H5921]] the ark, [[H727]] or else [[H3808]] he will die, [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] I appear [[H7200]] in the cloud [[H6051]] above [[H5921]] the mercy seat. [[H3727]] 
3 This is how [[H2063]] Aaron [[H175]] is to enter [[H935]] the Holy Place: [[H6944]] with a young bull [[H6499]] for a sin offering [[H2403]] and a ram [[H352]] for a burnt offering. [[H5930]] 
4 He is to wear [[H3847]] the sacred [[H6944]] linen [[H906]] tunic, [[H3801]] with linen [[H906]] undergarments. [[H4370]] He must tie [[H2296]] a linen [[H906]] sash [[H73]] around him [[H906]] and put on the linen [[H6801]] turban. [[H4701]] These [[H1992]] [are] sacred [[H6944]] garments, [[H899]] and he must bathe [[H7364]] himself [[H1320]] with water [[H4325]] before he wears them. [[H3847]] 
5 And [[H853]] he shall take [[H3947]] from the congregation [[H5712]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] two [[H8147]] male goats [[H8163]] for a sin offering [[H2403]] and one [[H259]] ram [[H352]] for a burnt offering. [[H5930]] 
6 Aaron [[H175]] is to present [[H7126]] the bull [[H6499]] for his sin offering [[H2403]] and make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H1157]] himself [[H1157]] and his household. [[H1004]] 
7 Then he shall take [[H3947]] the two [[H8147]] goats [[H8163]] and present [[H5975]] them before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] 
8 After Aaron [[H175]] casts [[H5414]] lots [[H1486]] for [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] goats, [[H8163]] one [[H259]] for the LORD [[H3068]] and the other [[H259]] for the scapegoat, [[H5799]] 
9 he [[H175]] shall present [[H7126]] the goat [[H8163]] chosen [[H5927]] by lot [[H1486]] for the LORD [[H3068]] and sacrifice [[H6213]] it as a sin offering. [[H2403]] 
10 But the goat [[H8163]] chosen [[H5927]] by lot [[H1486]] to be the scapegoat [[H5799]] shall be presented [[H5975]] alive [[H2416]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] to make purification [[H3722]] by sending [[H7971]] it into the wilderness [[H4057]] as the scapegoat. [[H5799]] 
11 When Aaron [[H175]] presents [[H7126]] the bull [[H6499]] for his sin offering [[H2403]] and makes atonement [[H3722]] for [[H1157]] himself and his household, [[H1004]] he is to slaughter [[H7819]] the bull [[H6499]] for his own sin offering. [[H2403]] 
12 Then he must take [[H3947]] a censer [[H4289]] full [[H4393]] of burning [[H784]] coals [[H1513]] from [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and two handfuls [[H4393]] of finely ground [[H1851]] fragrant [[H5561]] incense, [[H7004]] and take them [[H935]] inside [[H1004]] the veil. [[H6532]] 
13 He is to put [[H5414]] the incense [[H7004]] on [[H5921]] the fire [[H784]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and the cloud [[H6051]] of incense [[H7004]] will cover [[H3680]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] above [[H5921]] the testimony, [[H5715]] so that he will not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] 
14 And he is to take [[H3947]] some of the bull’s [[H6499]] blood [[H1818]] and sprinkle [[H5137]] it with his finger [[H676]] on [[H5921]] the east [[H6924]] side [[H6440]] of the mercy seat; [[H3727]] then he shall sprinkle [[H5137]] some of [[H4480]] [it] [[H1818]] with his finger [[H676]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] before [[H6440]] the mercy seat. [[H3727]] 
15 [Aaron] shall then slaughter [[H7819]] the goat [[H8163]] for the sin offering [[H2403]] for the people [[H5971]] and bring [[H935]] its blood [[H1818]] behind [[H1004]] the veil, [[H6532]] and with its blood [[H1818]] he must do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] with the bull’s [[H6499]] blood: [[H1818]] He is to sprinkle [[H5137]] it against [[H5921]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] and in front [[H6440]] of it. [[H3727]] 
16 So he shall make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the Most Holy Place [[H6944]] because of the impurities [[H2932]] and rebellious acts [[H6588]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] in regard to all [[H3605]] their sins. [[H2403]] He is to do [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] for the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] which abides [[H7931]] among them, [[H854]] because it is surrounded by [[H8432]] their impurities. [[H2932]] 
17 No [[H3605]] one [[H120]] may be [[H1961]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] from the time [Aaron] goes in [[H935]] to make atonement [[H3722]] in the Most Holy Place [[H6944]] until [[H5704]] he leaves, [[H3318]] after he has made atonement [[H3722]] for himself, [[H1157]] his household, [[H1004]] and the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
18 Then he shall go out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the altar [[H4196]] that [[H834]] is before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3069]] and make atonement [[H3722]] for it. [[H5921]] He is to take [[H3947]] some of the bull’s [[H6499]] blood [[H1818]] and some of the goat’s [[H8163]] blood [[H1818]] and put it [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] all [[H5439]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar. [[H4196]] 
19 He is to sprinkle [[H5137]] some of [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] on it [[H5921]] with his finger [[H676]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] to cleanse it [[H2891]] and consecrate it [[H6942]] from the uncleanness [[H2932]] of the Israelites. [[H3478]] 
20 When [Aaron] has finished [[H3615]] purifying [[H3722]] the Most Holy Place, [[H6944]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and the altar, [[H4196]] he is to bring forward [[H7126]] the live [[H2416]] goat. [[H8163]] 
21 Then [he] [[H175]] is to lay [[H5564]] both [[H8147]] hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the live [[H2416]] goat [[H8163]] and confess [[H3034]] over [[H5921]] it [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the iniquities [[H5771]] and rebellious acts [[H6588]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] in regard to [[H3605]] all [[H3605]] their sins. [[H2403]] He is to put [[H5414]] them on [[H5921]] the goats [[H8163]] head [[H7218]] and send it away [[H7971]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] by the hand [[H3027]] of a man [[H376]] appointed for the task. [[H6261]] 
22 The goat [[H8163]] will carry [[H5375]] on [[H5921]] itself [[H853]] all [[H3605]] their iniquities [[H5771]] into [[H413]] a solitary [[H1509]] place, [[H776]] and [the man] will release [[H7971]] [it] [[H8163]] into the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
23 Then Aaron [[H175]] is to enter [[H935]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] take off [[H6584]] the linen [[H906]] garments [[H899]] he put on [[H3847]] before entering [[H935]] the Most Holy Place, [[H6944]] and leave [[H3240]] them there. [[H8033]] 
24 He is to bathe [[H7364]] himself [[H1320]] with water [[H4325]] in a holy [[H6918]] place [[H4725]] and put on [[H3847]] his own clothes. [[H899]] Then he must go out [[H3318]] and sacrifice [[H6213]] his burnt offering [[H5930]] and the people’s [[H5971]] burnt offering [[H5930]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H1157]] himself [[H1157]] and for the people. [[H5971]] 
25 He is also to burn [[H6999]] the fat [[H2459]] of the sin offering [[H2403]] on the altar. [[H4196]] 
26 The man who released [[H7971]] the goat [[H8163]] as the scapegoat [[H5799]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] himself [[H1320]] with water; [[H4325]] afterward [[H310]] he may reenter [[H935]] the camp. [[H4264]] 
27 The bull [[H6499]] for the sin offering [[H2403]] and the goat [[H8163]] for the sin offering, [[H2403]] whose [[H834]] blood [[H1818]] was brought [[H935]] into the Most Holy Place [[H6944]] to make atonement, [[H3722]] must be taken [[H3318]] outside [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] and their hides, [[H5785]] flesh, [[H1320]] and dung [[H6569]] must be burned up. [[H8313]] 
28 The one who burns [[H8313]] them must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] himself [[H1320]] with water, [[H4325]] and afterward [[H310]] he may reenter [[H935]] the camp. [[H4264]] 
29 This is to be [[H1961]] a permanent [[H5769]] statute for you: [[H2708]] On the tenth [[H6218]] day [[H2320]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] you shall humble [[H6031]] your souls [[H5315]] and not do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] work— [[H4399]] whether the native [[H249]] or the foreigner [[H1616]] who resides [[H1481]] among you— [[H8432]] 
30 because [[H3588]] on this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] atonement will be made [[H3722]] for you [[H5921]] to cleanse [[H2891]] you, [[H853]] and you will be clean [[H2891]] from all [[H3605]] your sins [[H2403]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
31 It [[H1931]] is a Sabbath [[H7676]] of solemn rest [[H7677]] for you,  that you may humble [[H6031]] your souls; [[H5315]] it is a permanent [[H5769]] statute. [[H2708]] 
32 The priest [[H3548]] who [[H834]] is anointed [[H4886]] and ordained [[H4390]] to succeed [[H3547]] his father {as high priest} [[H1]] shall make atonement. [[H3722]] He will put on [[H3847]] the sacred [[H6944]] linen [[H906]] garments [[H899]] 
33 and make atonement [[H3722]] for the Most Holy Place, [[H4720]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and the altar, [[H4196]] and for [[H5921]] the priests [[H3548]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the assembly. [[H6951]] 
34 This [[H2063]] is to be [[H1961]] a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for you,  to make atonement [[H3722]] once [[H259]] a year [[H8141]] for [[H5921]] the Israelites [[H1121]] because of all [[H3605]] their sins.” [[H2403]] And all this was done [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses.
