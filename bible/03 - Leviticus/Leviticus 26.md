# Leviticus 26
[[Leviticus 25|←]] • [[Leviticus 27|→]]
1 You must not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] idols [[H457]] for yourselves  or set up [[H6965]] a carved image [[H6459]] or sacred pillar, [[H4676]] or place [[H5414]] a sculpted [[H4906]] stone [[H68]] in your land [[H776]] to bow down [[H7812]] to it, [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] 
2 You must keep [[H8104]] My Sabbaths [[H7676]] and show reverence for [[H3372]] My sanctuary. [[H4720]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 If [[H518]] you follow [[H1980]] My statutes [[H2708]] and carefully observe [[H8104]] My commandments, [[H4687]] 
4 I will give [[H5414]] you rains [[H1653]] in their season, [[H6256]] and the land [[H776]] will yield [[H5414]] its produce, [[H2981]] and the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] will bear [[H5414]] their fruit. [[H6529]] 
5 Your  threshing [[H1786]] will continue [[H5381]] until the grape harvest, [[H1210]] and the grape harvest [[H1210]] will continue [[H5381]] until sowing time; [[H2233]] you will have your fill of [[H7648]] food [[H3899]] to eat [[H398]] and will dwell [[H3427]] securely [[H983]] in your land. [[H776]] 
6 And I will give [[H5414]] peace [[H7965]] to the land, [[H776]] and you will lie down [[H7901]] with nothing [[H369]] to fear. [[H2729]] I will rid [[H7673]] the land [[H776]] of dangerous [[H7451]] animals, [[H2416]] and no [[H3808]] sword [[H2719]] will pass [[H5674]] through your land. [[H776]] 
7 You will pursue [[H7291]] your enemies, [[H341]] and they will fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] before you. [[H6440]] 
8 Five [[H2568]] of [[H4480]] you will pursue [[H7291]] a hundred, [[H3967]] and a hundred [[H3967]] of you [[H4480]] will chase [[H7291]] ten thousand, [[H7233]] and your enemies [[H341]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] before you. [[H6440]] 
9 I will turn [[H6437]] toward you [[H413]] and make you fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply [[H7235]] you, [[H853]] and I will fulfill [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] with you. [[H854]] 
10 You will still be eating [[H398]] the old [[H3465]] supply of grain [[H3462]] when you need to clear it out [[H3318]] to make room for [[H6440]] the new. [[H2319]] 
11 And I will make [[H5414]] My dwelling place [[H4908]] among you, [[H8432]] and I [[H5315]] will not [[H3808]] reject you. [[H1602]] 
12 I will walk [[H1980]] among you [[H8432]] and be [[H1961]] your  God, [[H430]] and you [[H859]] will be [[H1961]] My  people. [[H5971]] 
13 I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought [[H3318]] you [[H853]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] that you would no longer be [[H1961]] slaves [[H5650]] to [the Egyptians].  I broke [[H7665]] the bars [[H4133]] of your yoke [[H5923]] and enabled you to walk [[H1980]] in uprightness. [[H6968]] 
14 If, however, [[H518]] you fail [[H3808]] to obey [[H8085]] Me  and to carry out [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] commandments, [[H4687]] 
15 and if [[H518]] you reject [[H3988]] My statutes, [[H2708]] despise [[H1602]] My ordinances, [[H4941]] and neglect [[H1115]] to carry out [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] My commandments, [[H4687]] and so break [[H6565]] My covenant, [[H1285]] 
16 then [[H637]] this is what [[H2063]] I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]] to you:  I will bring [[H6485]] upon you [[H5921]] sudden terror, [[H928]] wasting disease, [[H7829]] and [[H853]] fever [[H6920]] that will destroy [[H3615]] your sight [[H5869]] and drain [[H1727]] your life. [[H5315]] You will sow [[H2232]] your seed [[H2233]] in vain, [[H7385]] because your enemies [[H341]] will eat it. [[H398]] 
17 And I will set [[H5414]] My face [[H6440]] against you,  so that you will be defeated [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] your enemies. [[H341]] Those who hate you [[H8130]] will rule [[H7287]] over you,  and you will flee [[H5127]] when no one [[H369]] pursues [[H7291]] you. [[H853]] 
18 And if [[H518]] after [[H5704]] all this [[H428]] you will not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] Me,  I will proceed [[H3254]] to punish [[H3256]] you [[H853]] sevenfold [[H7651]] for [[H5921]] your sins. [[H2403]] 
19 I will break down [[H7665]] your stubborn [[H5797]] pride [[H1347]] and make [[H5414]] your sky [[H8064]] like iron [[H1270]] and your land [[H776]] like bronze, [[H5154]] 
20 and your strength [[H3581]] will be spent [[H8552]] in vain. [[H7385]] For your land [[H776]] will not [[H3808]] yield [[H5414]] its [[H853]] produce, [[H2981]] and the trees [[H6086]] of the land [[H776]] will not [[H3808]] bear [[H5414]] their fruit. [[H6529]] 
21 If [[H518]] you walk [[H1980]] in hostility [[H7147]] toward Me [[H5973]] and refuse [[H3808]] to obey Me, [[H8085]] I will multiply [[H3254]] your plagues [[H4347]] seven times, [[H7651]] according to your sins. [[H2403]] 
22 I will send [[H7971]] wild [[H7704]] animals [[H2416]] against you  to rob you of your children, [[H7921]] destroy [[H3772]] your livestock, [[H929]] and reduce [[H4591]] your numbers, [[H853]] until your roads [[H1870]] lie desolate. [[H8074]] 
23 And if [[H518]] in spite of these [[H428]] things you do not [[H3808]] accept My discipline, [[H3256]] but continue to walk [[H1980]] in hostility [[H7147]] toward Me, [[H5973]] 
24 then I [[H589]] will act [[H1980]] with hostility [[H7147]] toward you [[H5973]] and [[H1571]] strike [[H5221]] you [[H853]] sevenfold [[H7651]] for [[H5921]] your sins. [[H2403]] 
25 And I will bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] against you [[H5921]] to execute [[H5358]] the vengeance [[H5359]] of the covenant. [[H1285]] Though you withdraw [[H622]] into [[H413]] your cities, [[H5892]] I will send [[H7971]] a pestilence [[H1698]] among you, [[H8432]] and you will be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy. [[H341]] 
26 When I cut off [[H7665]] your supply [[H4294]] of bread, [[H3899]] ten [[H6235]] women [[H802]] will bake [[H644]] your bread [[H3899]] in a single [[H259]] oven [[H8574]] and dole out [[H7725]] your bread [[H3899]] by weight, [[H4948]] so that you will eat [[H398]] but not [[H3808]] be satisfied. [[H7646]] 
27 But if [[H518]] in spite of all this [[H2063]] you do not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] Me,  but continue to walk [[H1980]] in hostility [[H7147]] toward Me, [[H5973]] 
28 I will act [[H1980]] with furious [[H2534]] rage [[H7147]] against you, [[H5973]] and I Myself [[H589]] will punish [[H3256]] you sevenfold [[H7651]] for [[H5921]] your sins. [[H2403]] 
29 You will eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of your sons [[H1121]] and the flesh [[H1320]] of your daughters. [[H1323]] 
30 I will destroy [[H8045]] your high places, [[H1116]] cut down [[H3772]] your incense altars, [[H2553]] and heap [[H5414]] your dead bodies [[H6297]] on [[H5921]] the remains [[H6297]] of your idols; [[H1544]] and My soul [[H5315]] will despise [[H1602]] you. [[H853]] 
31 I will reduce [[H5414]] your cities [[H5892]] to rubble [[H2723]] and lay waste [[H8074]] to your sanctuaries, [[H4720]] and I will refuse [[H3808]] to smell [[H7306]] the pleasing [[H5207]] aroma of your sacrifices. [[H7381]] 
32 And I [[H589]] will lay waste [[H8074]] to the land, [[H776]] so that your enemies [[H341]] who dwell [[H3427]] in it  will be appalled. [[H8074]] 
33 But [[H853]] I will scatter [[H2219]] you among the nations [[H1471]] and will draw out [[H7324]] a sword [[H2719]] after you [[H310]] as your land [[H776]] becomes [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] and your cities [[H5892]] are laid [[H1961]] waste. [[H2723]] 
34 Then [[H227]] the land [[H776]] shall enjoy [[H7521]] its [[H853]] Sabbaths [[H7676]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] it lies desolate, [[H8074]] while you [[H859]] are in the land [[H776]] of your enemies. [[H341]] At that time [[H227]] the land [[H776]] will rest [[H7673]] and enjoy [[H7521]] its [[H853]] Sabbaths. [[H7676]] 
35 As long as [[H3605]] it lies desolate, [[H8074]] [the land] will have the rest [[H7673]] it did not [[H3808]] receive [[H7673]] during the Sabbaths [[H7676]] when you lived [[H3427]] in it. [[H5921]] 
36 As for those of you who survive, [[H7604]] I will send [[H935]] a faintness [[H4816]] into their hearts [[H3824]] in the lands [[H776]] of their enemies, [[H341]] so that even the sound [[H6963]] of a windblown [[H5086]] leaf [[H5929]] will put them to flight. [[H7291]] And they will flee [[H5127]] as one flees [[H4499]] the sword, [[H2719]] and fall [[H5307]] when no one [[H369]] pursues them. [[H7291]] 
37 They will stumble [[H3782]] over one [[H376]] another [[H251]] as before [[H6440]] the sword, [[H2719]] though no one [[H369]] is behind them. [[H7291]] So [[H3808]] you will not  be [[H1961]] able to stand [[H8617]] against [[H6440]] your enemies. [[H341]] 
38 You will perish [[H6]] among the nations, [[H1471]] and the land [[H776]] of your enemies [[H341]] will consume [[H398]] you. [[H853]] 
39 Those of you who survive [[H7604]] in the lands [[H776]] of your enemies [[H341]] will waste away [[H4743]] in their iniquity [[H5771]] and [[H637]] will decay [[H4743]] in the sins [[H5771]] of their fathers. [[H1]] 
40 But if they will confess [[H3034]] their iniquity [[H5771]] and [that] [[H5771]] of their fathers [[H1]] in the unfaithfulness [[H4604]] that [[H834]] they practiced against Me, [[H4604]] by which [[H834]] they have also walked [[H1980]] in hostility [[H7147]] toward Me— [[H5973]] 
41 and [[H637]] I [[H589]] acted [[H1980]] with hostility [[H7147]] toward [[H5973]] them and brought [[H935]] them into the land [[H776]] of their enemies— [[H341]] and [[H176]] if their uncircumcised [[H6189]] hearts [[H3824]] will be humbled [[H3665]] and they will make amends [[H7521]] for their iniquity, [[H5771]] 
42 then I will remember [[H2142]] My covenant [[H1285]] with Jacob [[H3290]] and [[H637]] My covenant [[H1285]] with Isaac [[H3327]] and My covenant [[H1285]] with Abraham, [[H85]] and I will remember [[H2142]] the land. [[H776]] 
43 For the land [[H776]] will be abandoned [[H5800]] by them, [[H1992]] and it will enjoy [[H7521]] its Sabbaths [[H7676]] by lying desolate [[H8074]] without them. [[H1992]] And they [[H1992]] will pay the penalty [[H7521]] for their iniquity, [[H5771]] because [[H3282]] they rejected [[H3988]] My ordinances [[H4941]] and abhorred [[H1602]] My statutes. [[H2708]] 
44 Yet [[H637]] in spite of [[H1571]] this, [[H2063]] when they are [[H1961]] in the land [[H776]] of their enemies, [[H341]] I will not [[H3808]] reject [[H3988]] or [[H3808]] despise them [[H1602]] so as to destroy them [[H3615]] and break [[H6565]] My covenant [[H1285]] with them; [[H854]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]] 
45 But for their sake  I will remember [[H2142]] the covenant [[H1285]] with their fathers, [[H7223]] whom [[H834]] I brought out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the nations, [[H1471]] that I might be [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
46 These [[H428]] are the statutes, [[H2706]] ordinances, [[H4941]] and laws [[H8451]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] established [[H5414]] between [[H996]] Himself and the Israelites [[H1121]] through [[H3027]] Moses [[H4872]] on Mount [[H2022]] Sinai. [[H5514]]
