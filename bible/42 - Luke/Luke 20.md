# Luke 20
[[Luke 19|←]] • [[Luke 21|→]]
1 One [[G1520]] day [[G2250]] [as Jesus] [[G846]] was teaching [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] proclaiming the gospel, [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes, [[G1122]] together with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] came up [to Him]. [[G2186]] 
2 “Tell [[G2036]] us,” [[G1473]] they said, [[G3004]] “by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] are You doing [[G4160]] these things, [[G3778]] [and] [[G2228]] who [[G5101]] gave [[G1325]] You [[G4771]] this [[G3778]] authority?” [[G1849]] 
3 “I will also ask [[G2065]] you [[G4771]] a question,” [[G3056]] [Jesus] replied. [[G2036]] “Tell [[G2036]] Me: [[G1473]] 
4 John’s [[G2491]] baptism— [[G908]] was it [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] or [[G2228]] from [[G1537]] men?” [[G444]] 
5 They deliberated [[G4817]] among [[G4314]] themselves [[G1438]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “If [[G1437]] we say, [[G2036]] ‘From [[G1537]] heaven,’ [[G3772]] He will ask, [[G2046]] ‘Why [[G1223]] did you not believe [[G4100]] him?’ [[G846]] 
6 But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] we say, [[G2036]] ‘From [[G1537]] men,’ [[G444]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] will stone [[G2642]] us, [[G1473]] for [[G1063]] they are [[G1510]] convinced [that] [[G3982]] John [[G2491]] was [[G1510]] a prophet.” [[G4396]] 
7 So [[G2532]] they answered [that] [[G611]] they did not know [[G1492]] where [it was] from. [[G4159]] 
8 And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G2036]] “Neither [[G3761]] {will} I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I am doing [[G4160]] these things.” [[G3778]] 
9 Then [[G1161]] He proceeded [[G756]] to tell [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] this [[G3778]] parable: [[G3850]] “A [[G5100]] man [[G444]] planted [[G5452]] a vineyard, [[G290]] rented [[G1554]] it {out} [[G846]] to [some] tenants, [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] went away [[G589]] for a long [[G2425]] time. [[G5550]] 
10 At harvest time, [[G2540]] he sent [[G649]] a servant [[G1401]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] tenants [[G1092]] to [[G2443]] collect [[G1325]] [his share] [[G575]] of the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] of the [[G3588]] vineyard. [[G290]] But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] tenants [[G1092]] beat [the servant] [[G1194]] [and] sent him away [[G1821]] empty-handed. [[G2756]] 
11 [So] [[G2532]] he sent [[G3992]] another [[G2087]] servant, [[G1401]] but [[G1161]] they beat [him] [[G1194]] and [[G2532]] humiliated [[G818]] him, [[G2548]] sending [him] away [[G1821]] empty-handed. [[G2756]] 
12 Then [[G2532]] he sent [[G3992]] a third, [[G5154]] but [[G1161]] they wounded [[G5135]] him [[G3778]] [and] threw [him] out. [[G1544]] 
13 ‘What [[G5101]] shall I do?’ [[G4160]] asked [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] owner [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] vineyard. [[G290]] ‘I will send [[G3992]] my [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] son. [[G5207]] Perhaps [[G2481]] they will respect [[G1788]] him.’ [[G3778]] 
14 But when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] tenants [[G1092]] saw [[G3708]] [the son], [[G846]] they discussed it [[G1260]] among [[G4314]] themselves [[G240]] [and] said, [[G3004]] ‘This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] heir; [[G2818]] let us kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] [and] [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] inheritance [[G2817]] will be [[G1096]] ours. [[G1473]] 
15 So [[G2532]] they threw [[G1544]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] [and] killed [him]. [[G615]] What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] {will} the [[G3588]] owner [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] do [[G4160]] to them? [[G846]] 
16 He will come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] kill [[G622]] those [[G3778]] tenants, [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] will give [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] to others.” [[G243]] And [[G1161]] [when the people] heard [this], [[G191]] they said, [[G2036]] “May such a thing never happen!” [[G1096]] 
17 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] looked directly at [[G1689]] them [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Then [[G3767]] what [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] the meaning of [[G3778]] that which [[G3588]] is written: [[G1125]] ‘[The] stone [[G3037]] the [[G3588]] builders [[G3618]] rejected [[G593]] has become [[G1096]] [the] cornerstone’? [[G2776]] 
18 Everyone [[G3956]] who falls [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] this [[G1565]] stone [[G3037]] will be broken to pieces, [[G4917]] but [[G1161]] he on whom [[G3739]] it falls [[G4098]] will be crushed.” [[G3039]] 
19 [When] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] chief priests [[G749]] realized [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] had spoken [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] parable [[G3850]] against [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] they sought [[G2212]] to arrest [[G1911]] Him [[G846]] that very [[G846]] hour. [[G5610]] But [[G2532]] they were afraid [[G5399]] of the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]] 
20 So [[G2532]] they watched [Him] closely [[G3906]] [and] sent [[G649]] spies [[G1455]] who pretended [[G5271]] to be [[G1510]] sincere. [[G1342]] They were hoping [[G2443]] to catch [Him] [[G1949]] in His [[G846]] words [[G3056]] in order [[G5620]] to hand Him over [[G3860]] to the [[G3588]] rule [[G746]] and [[G2532]] authority [[G1849]] of the [[G3588]] governor. [[G2232]] 
21 “Teacher,” [[G1320]] they inquired, [[G1905]] “we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] You speak [[G3004]] and [[G2532]] teach [[G1321]] correctly. [[G3723]] You show no partiality, [[G3756]] but [[G235]] teach [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of God [[G2316]] in accordance with [[G1909]] the truth. [[G225]] 
22 Is it lawful [[G1832]] for us [[G1473]] to pay [[G1325]] taxes [[G5411]] to Caesar [[G2541]] or [[G2228]] not?” [[G3756]] 
23 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] saw through [[G2657]] their [[G846]] duplicity [[G3834]] [and] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] 
24 “Show [[G1166]] Me [[G1473]] a denarius. [[G1220]] Whose [[G5101]] image [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] inscription [[G1923]] are on it?” [[G2192]] “Caesar’s,” [[G2541]] they answered. [[G2036]] 
25 So [[G5106]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Give [[G591]] to Caesar [[G2541]] what [is] [[G3588]] Caesar’s, [[G2541]] and [[G2532]] to God [[G2316]] what [is] [[G3588]] God’s.” [[G2316]] 
26 And [[G2532]] they were unable [[G2480]] to trap Him in [[G1949]] His [[G846]] words [[G4487]] before [[G1726]] the [[G3588]] people; [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] astonished [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] His [[G846]] answer, [[G612]] they fell silent. [[G4601]] 
27 Then [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] Sadducees, [[G4523]] who [[G3588]] say there is no [[G483]] resurrection, [[G386]] came [[G4334]] to question [[G1905]] Him. [[G846]] 
28 “Teacher,” [[G1320]] they said, [[G3004]] “Moses [[G3475]] wrote [[G1125]] for us [[G1473]] that if [[G1437]] a man’s [[G5100]] brother [[G80]] dies [[G599]] [and] leaves [[G2192]] a wife [[G1135]] but [[G2532]] no children, [[G815]] [the man] [[G80]] should marry [[G2983]] [his brother’s] [[G3588]] [widow] [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] raise up [[G1817]] offspring [[G4690]] for [[G3588]] [him]. [[G80]] 
29 Now [[G3767]] there were [[G1510]] seven [[G2033]] brothers. [[G80]] The [[G3588]] first [one] [[G4413]] married [[G2983]] a wife, [[G1135]] [but] died [[G599]] childless. [[G815]] 
30 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] 
31 and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] married [[G2983]] her, [[G846]] and [[G1161]] in the same way [[G5615]] [all] [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] died, [[G599]] leaving [[G2641]] no [[G3756]] children. [[G5043]] 
32 And [[G2532]] last of all, [[G5305]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] died. [[G599]] 
33 So then, [[G3767]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection, [[G386]] whose [[G5101]] wife [[G1135]] will she be? [[G1096]] For [[G1063]] [all] [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] were married [[G1135]] to her.” [[G846]] 
34 Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of this [[G3778]] age [[G165]] marry [[G1060]] and [[G2532]] are given in marriage. [[G1061]] 
35 But [[G1161]] those who are [[G3588]] considered worthy [[G2661]] to share [[G5177]] in [[G1565]] the [[G3588]] age [to come] [[G165]] and [[G2532]] in the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead [[G3498]] {will} neither [[G3777]] marry [[G1060]] nor [[G3777]] be given in marriage. [[G1061]] 
36 In fact, [[G1063]] they can [[G1410]] no [[G3761]] longer [[G2089]] die, [[G599]] because [[G1063]] they are [[G1510]] like [the] angels. [[G2465]] And [[G2532]] since they are [[G1510]] sons [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] resurrection, [[G386]] they are [[G1510]] sons [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]] 
37 Even [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] demonstrates [[G3377]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] are raised, [[G1453]] [ in the passage ] about [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] [ burning ] bush. [[G942]] For [[G5613]] he calls [[G3004]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] ‘the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] [the] God [[G2316]] of Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] [the] God [[G2316]] of Jacob. [[G2384]] 
38 He is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] [the] God [[G2316]] of [the] dead [[G3498]] but [[G235]] of [the] living, [[G2198]] for [[G1063]] to Him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] are alive.” [[G2198]] 
39 Some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] answered, [[G611]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] you have spoken [[G2036]] well!” [[G2573]] 
40 And [[G1063]] they did not dare [[G5111]] to question [[G1905]] Him [[G846]] any [further]. [[G3762]] 
41 Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] declared, [[G2036]] “How [[G4459]] can it be said that [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] is [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of David? [[G1138]] 
42 For [[G1063]] David [[G1138]] himself [[G846]] says [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] [the] book [[G976]] of Psalms: [[G5568]] ‘[The] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] to my [[G1473]] Lord, [[G2962]] “Sit [[G2521]] at [[G1537]] My [[G1473]] right hand [[G1188]] 
43 until [[G2193]] I make [[G5087]] Your [[G4771]] enemies [[G2190]] a footstool [[G5286]] for [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] feet.”’ [[G4228]] 
44 So if [[G3767]] David [[G1138]] calls [[G2564]] Him [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G4459]] can He be [[G1510]] [David’s] [[G846]] son?” [[G5207]] 
45 In the hearing [[G191]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] 
46 “Beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] scribes. [[G1122]] They like [[G2309]] to walk around [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] long robes, [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] they love [[G5368]] [the] greetings [[G783]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplaces, [[G58]] [the] chief seats [[G4410]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] [the] places of honor [[G4411]] at [[G1722]] banquets. [[G1173]] 
47 [They] [[G3739]] defraud [[G2719]] widows [[G5503]] [of their] [[G3588]] houses, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] for a show [[G4392]] make lengthy prayers. [[G3117]] These [men] [[G3778]] will receive [[G2983]] greater [[G4053]] condemnation.” [[G2917]]
