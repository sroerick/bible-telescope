[[Luke 12|←]] • [[Luke 14|→]]
1 At [[G1722]] that [[G846]] time, [[G2540]] some [of those] [[G5100]] present [[G3918]] told [[G518]] [Jesus] [[G846]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Galileans [[G1057]] whose [[G3739]] blood [[G129]] Pilate [[G4091]] had mixed [[G3396]] with [[G3326]] their [[G846]] sacrifices. [[G2378]] 
2 [To this] [[G2532]] He replied, [[G611]] “Do you think [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] Galileans [[G1057]] were [[G1096]] [worse] [[G3844]] sinners [[G268]] than all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] [other] Galileans, [[G1057]] because [[G3754]] they suffered [[G3958]] this fate? [[G3778]] 
3 No, [[G3780]] I tell [[G3004]] you. [[G4771]] But [[G235]] unless [[G1437]] you repent, [[G3340]] you too will all perish. [[G622]] 
4 Or [[G2228]] those [[G1565]] eighteen [[G1176]] who [[G3739]] were killed [[G615]] [when] the [[G3588]] tower [[G4444]] of [[G1722]] Siloam [[G4611]] collapsed [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] them: [[G846]] Do you think [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] they [[G846]] were [[G1096]] more [[G3844]] sinful [[G3781]] [than] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] [others] [[G444]] living [[G2730]] in Jerusalem? [[G2419]] 
5 No, [[G3780]] I tell [[G3004]] you. [[G4771]] But [[G235]] unless [[G1437]] you repent, [[G3340]] you too will all perish.” [[G622]] 
6 Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] parable: [[G3850]] “A [man] [[G5100]] had [[G2192]] a fig tree [[G4808]] that was planted [[G5452]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] vineyard. [[G290]] He went [[G2064]] to look for [[G2212]] fruit [[G2590]] on [[G1722]] it, [[G846]] [but] [[G2532]] did not find [any]. [[G2147]] 
7 So [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] keeper of the vineyard, [[G289]] ‘Look, [[G2400]] for [[G575]] the past [[G3739]] three [[G5140]] years [[G2094]] I have come [[G2064]] to search for [[G2212]] fruit [[G2590]] on [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] fig tree [[G4808]] and [[G2532]] haven’t found [any]. [[G2147]] Therefore [[G3767]] cut it down! [[G1581]] Why [[G2443]] should it use up [[G2673]] the [[G3588]] soil?’ [[G1093]] 
8 ‘Sir,’ [[G2962]] [the man] replied, [[G3004]] ‘leave it alone [[G863]] again [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] year, [[G2094]] until [[G2193]] I dig [[G4626]] around [[G4012]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] fertilize [it]. [[G2874]] 
9 If [[G2579]] it bears [[G4160]] fruit [[G2590]] [next year], [[G3588]] fine. [[G3195]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] not, [[G1490]] you can cut it down.’” [[G1581]] 
10 [One] [[G1161]] Sabbath [[G4521]] [Jesus] was [[G1510]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] 
11 and [[G2532]] a woman [[G1135]] there [[G2400]] had been [[G2192]] disabled [[G769]] [by a] spirit [[G4151]] [for] eighteen [[G1176]] years. [[G2094]] She was [[G1510]] hunched over [[G4794]] and [[G2532]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3361]] stand up [[G352]] straight. [[G1519]] 
12 When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] her, [[G846]] He called [her] over [[G4377]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “Woman, [[G1135]] you are set free [[G630]] from your [[G4771]] infirmity.” [[G769]] 
13 Then [[G2532]] He laid [[G2007]] [His] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G3916]] she straightened up [[G461]] and [[G2532]] began to glorify [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]] 
14 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] synagogue leader [[G752]] was indignant [[G23]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] had healed [[G2323]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath. [[G4521]] “There are [[G1510]] six [[G1803]] days [[G2250]] for [[G1722]] work,” [[G2038]] he told [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] crowd. [[G3793]] “So [[G3767]] come [[G2064]] [and] be healed [[G2323]] on [[G1722]] those [days] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath.” [[G4521]] 
15 “You hypocrites!” [[G5273]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] replied, [[G611]] “{Does} not [[G3756]] each [[G1538]] of you [[G4771]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] untie [[G3089]] his [[G846]] ox [[G1016]] or [[G2228]] donkey [[G3688]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] stall [[G5336]] and [[G2532]] lead it [[G520]] to water? [[G4222]] 
16 Then [[G1161]] should [[G1163]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] daughter [[G2364]] of Abraham, [[G11]] whom [[G3739]] Satan [[G4567]] has bound [[G1210]] [for] eighteen [[G1176]] [long] [[G2400]] years, [[G2094]] be released [[G3089]] from [[G575]] [her] [[G3778]] bondage [[G1199]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] day?” [[G2250]] 
17 When [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] said [[G3004]] this, [[G3778]] all [[G3956]] [His] [[G846]] adversaries [[G480]] were humiliated. [[G2617]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] crowd [[G3793]] rejoiced [[G5463]] at [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] glorious things [[G1741]] He was doing. [[G1096]] 
18 Then [[G3767]] [Jesus] asked, [[G2036]] “What [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] like? [[G3664]] To what [[G5101]] can I compare [[G3666]] it? [[G846]] 
19 It is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] a mustard seed [[G4615]] that [[G3739]] a man [[G444]] tossed [[G906]] into [[G1519]] his [[G1438]] garden. [[G2779]] It grew [[G837]] and [[G2532]] became [[G1096]] a tree, [[G1186]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G4071]] of the [[G3588]] air [[G3772]] nested [[G2681]] in [[G1722]] its [[G846]] branches. [[G2798]] 
20 Again [[G3825]] He asked, [[G2036]] “To what [[G5101]] can I compare [[G3666]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God? [[G2316]] 
21 It is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] yeast [[G2219]] that [[G3739]] a woman [[G1135]] took [[G2983]] [and] mixed [[G2928]] into [[G1519]] three [[G5140]] measures [[G4568]] of flour [[G224]] until [[G2193]] all [[G3650]] of it [[G3739]] was leavened.” [[G2220]] 
22 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] traveled [[G1279]] throughout [[G2596]] [the] towns [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] villages, [[G2968]] teaching [[G1321]] as He made [[G4160]] His way [[G4197]] toward [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]] 
23 “Lord,” [[G2962]] someone [[G5100]] asked [[G2036]] Him, [[G846]] “[will] [[G1487]] only a few [[G3641]] [people] [[G3588]] be saved?” [[G4982]] [Jesus] answered, [[G2036]] 
24 “Make every effort [[G75]] to enter [[G1525]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] narrow [[G4728]] door. [[G2374]] For [[G3754]] many, [[G4183]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] will try [[G2212]] to enter [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] will not be able. [[G2480]] 
25 After [[G575]] the [[G3588]] master of the house [[G3617]] gets up [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] shuts [[G608]] the [[G3588]] door, [[G2374]] you will [[G756]] stand [[G2476]] outside [[G1854]] knocking [[G2925]] [and] saying, [[G3004]] ‘Lord, [[G2962]] open the door [[G455]] for us.’ [[G1473]] But [[G2532]] he will reply, [[G2046]] ‘I do not know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] you [[G4771]] are {from}.’ [[G1510]] 
26 Then [[G5119]] you will [[G756]] say, [[G3004]] ‘We ate [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] drank [[G4095]] with you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] streets.’ [[G4113]] 
27 And [[G2532]] he will answer, [[G2046]] ‘I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] I do not know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] you [[G4771]] are {from}. [[G1510]] Depart [[G868]] from [[G575]] me, [[G1473]] all [you] [[G3956]] evildoers.’ [[G2040]] 
28 There [[G1563]] will be [[G1510]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of [[G3588]] teeth [[G3599]] when [[G3752]] you see [[G3708]] Abraham, [[G11]] Isaac, [[G2464]] Jacob, [[G2384]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] you yourselves [[G4771]] are thrown [[G1544]] out. [[G1854]] 
29 [People] will come [[G2240]] from [[G575]] east [[G395]] and [[G2532]] west [[G1424]] and [[G2532]] north [[G1005]] and [[G2532]] south, [[G3558]] and [[G2532]] will recline at the table [[G347]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]] 
30 And [[G2532]] indeed, [[G2400]] some who are [[G1510]] last [[G2078]] will be [[G1510]] first, [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] some who are [[G1510]] first [[G4413]] will be [[G1510]] last.” [[G2078]] 
31 At [[G1722]] that [[G3588]] very [[G846]] hour, [[G5610]] some [[G5100]] Pharisees [[G5330]] came to [Jesus] [[G4334]] [and] told [[G3004]] Him, [[G846]] “Leave [[G1831]] this place [[G1782]] and [[G2532]] get away, [[G4198]] because [[G3754]] Herod [[G2264]] wants [[G2309]] to kill [[G615]] You.” [[G4771]] 
32 But [[G2532]] [Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “Go [[G4198]] tell [[G2036]] that [[G3778]] fox, [[G258]] ‘Look, [[G2400]] I will keep driving out [[G1544]] demons [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] healing [people] [[G2392]] today [[G4594]] and [[G2532]] tomorrow, [[G839]] and [[G2532]] on the [[G3588]] third [day] [[G5154]] I will reach My goal.’ [[G5048]] 
33 Nevertheless, [[G4133]] I [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] keep going [[G4198]] today [[G4594]] and [[G2532]] tomorrow [[G839]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] next [day], [[G2192]] for [[G3754]] it is not admissible [for] [[G1735]] a prophet [[G4396]] to perish [[G622]] outside of [[G1854]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] 
34 O Jerusalem, [[G2419]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] who [[G3588]] kills [[G615]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] stones [[G3036]] those [[G3588]] sent [[G649]] to [[G4314]] her! [[G846]] How often [[G4212]] I have longed [[G2309]] to gather [[G1996]] your [[G4771]] children {together} [[G5043]] as [[G5158]] a hen [gathers] [[G3733]] her [[G1438]] chicks [[G3555]] under [her] [[G5259]] wings, [[G4420]] but [[G2532]] you were unwilling. [[G2309]] 
35 Look, [[G2400]] your [[G4771]] house [[G3624]] is left to you desolate. [[G863]] And [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] you will not see [[G3708]] Me {again} [[G1473]] until [[G2193]] you say, [[G2036]] ‘Blessed is [[G2127]] He who [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord.’” [[G2962]]
