# Luke 6
[[Luke 5|←]] • [[Luke 7|→]]
1 [One] Sabbath [[G4521]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was passing [[G1279]] through [[G1223]] [the] grainfields, [[G4702]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] began to pick [[G5089]] the [[G3588]] heads of grain, [[G4719]] rub [them] [[G5597]] in [their] [[G3588]] hands, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] eat [them]. [[G2068]] 
2 But [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] asked, [[G2036]] “Why [[G5101]] are you doing [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] is unlawful [[G1832]] [on] the [[G3588]] Sabbath?” [[G4521]] 
3 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Have you not read [[G314]] what [[G3739]] David [[G1138]] did [[G4160]] when [[G3753]] he [[G846]] and [[G2532]] his companions [[G3588]] were hungry? [[G3983]] 
4 He entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of God, [[G2316]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] consecrated bread [[G740]] and [[G2532]] gave [it] [[G1325]] to his companions, [[G3588]] [and] ate [[G5315]] what [[G3739]] is lawful [[G1832]] only for [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] priests [[G2409]] to eat.” [[G5315]] 
5 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] declared, [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] is [[G1510]] Lord [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] Sabbath.” [[G4521]] 
6 On [[G1722]] another [[G2087]] Sabbath, [[G4521]] [Jesus] [[G846]] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] was teaching, [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] a man [[G444]] was [[G1510]] there [[G1563]] [whose] [[G846]] right [[G1188]] hand [[G5495]] was [[G1510]] withered. [[G3584]] 
7 Looking for a reason [[G2147]] to accuse [[G2723]] [Jesus], [[G846]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] were watching Him closely [[G3906]] [to see] if [[G1487]] He would heal [[G2323]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath. [[G4521]] 
8 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] knew [[G1492]] their [[G846]] thoughts [[G1261]] and [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] man [[G435]] with [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] withered [[G3584]] hand, [[G5495]] “Get up [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] stand [[G2476]] among [us].” [[G3319]] So [[G2532]] he got up [[G450]] [and] stood [there]. [[G2476]] 
9 Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “I ask [[G1905]] you, [[G4771]] which [[G1487]] is lawful [[G1832]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath: [[G4521]] to do good [[G15]] or [[G2228]] to do evil, [[G2554]] to save [[G4982]] life [[G5590]] or [[G2228]] to destroy [it]?” [[G622]] 
10 And [[G2532]] after looking around [[G4017]] at all [[G3956]] of them, [[G846]] He said [[G2036]] to [the man], [[G846]] “Stretch out [[G1614]] your [[G4771]] hand.” [[G5495]] He did [so], [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] [it] [[G5495]] was restored. [[G600]] 
11 But [[G1161]] [the scribes and Pharisees] [[G846]] were filled [[G4130]] with rage [[G454]] and [[G2532]] began to discuss [[G1255]] with [[G4314]] one another [[G240]] what [[G5101]] they might do [[G4160]] to Jesus. [[G2424]] 
12 In [[G1722]] those [[G3778]] days, [[G2250]] [Jesus] went out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] to pray, [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] He spent the night [[G1273]] in [[G1722]] prayer [[G4335]] to God. [[G2316]] 
13 When [[G3753]] daylight [[G2250]] came, [[G1096]] He called [[G4377]] His [[G846]] disciples {to Him} [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] chose [[G1586]] twelve [[G1427]] of [[G575]] them, [[G846]] whom [[G3739]] He also designated as [[G3687]] apostles: [[G652]] 
14 Simon, [[G4613]] whom [[G3739]] He named [[G3687]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Andrew, [[G406]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] Philip [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] Bartholomew, [[G918]] 
15 Matthew [[G3156]] and [[G2532]] Thomas, [[G2381]] James [[G2385]] [son of] Alphaeus [[G256]] and [[G2532]] Simon [[G4613]] called [[G2564]] [the] Zealot, [[G2207]] 
16 Judas [son] [[G2455]] of James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] who [[G3739]] became [[G1096]] [a] traitor. [[G4273]] 
17 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] came down [[G2597]] with [[G3326]] them [[G846]] [and] stood [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] a level [[G3977]] place. [[G5117]] A large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] of His [[G846]] disciples [was there], [[G3101]] along with [[G2532]] a great [[G4183]] number [[G4128]] of [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] from [[G575]] all over [[G3956]] Judea, [[G2449]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea coast [[G3882]] of Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon. [[G4605]] 
18 They [[G3739]] had come [[G2064]] to hear [[G191]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] to be healed [[G2390]] of [[G575]] their [[G846]] diseases, [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] troubled [[G1776]] by [[G575]] unclean [[G169]] spirits [[G4151]] were healed. [[G2323]] 
19 The [[G3588]] entire [[G3956]] crowd [[G3793]] was trying [[G2212]] to touch [[G680]] Him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] power [[G1411]] was coming [[G1831]] from [[G3844]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] healing [[G2390]] them all. [[G3956]] 
20 Looking up [[G1869]] at [[G1519]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] [Jesus] [[G846]] said: [[G2036]] “Blessed [are] [[G3107]] [you] who are [[G3588]] poor, [[G4434]] for [[G3754]] yours [[G5212]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]] 
21 Blessed [are] [[G3107]] [you] who [[G3588]] hunger [[G3983]] now, [[G3568]] for [[G3754]] you will be satisfied. [[G5526]] Blessed [are] [[G3107]] [you] who [[G3588]] weep [[G2799]] now, [[G3568]] for [[G3754]] you will laugh. [[G1070]] 
22 Blessed [[G3107]] are you [[G1510]] when [[G3752]] people [[G444]] hate [[G3404]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] they exclude [you] [[G873]] and [[G2532]] insult [[G3679]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] reject [[G1544]] your [[G4771]] name [[G3686]] as [[G5613]] evil [[G4190]] because of [[G1752]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man. [[G444]] 
23 Rejoice [[G5463]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] leap for joy, [[G4640]] because [[G1063]] great [is] [[G4183]] your [[G4771]] reward [[G3408]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] For [[G1063]] their [[G846]] fathers [[G3962]] treated [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] in the same way. [[G846]] 
24 But [[G4133]] woe [[G3759]] to you [[G4771]] who are [[G3588]] rich, [[G4145]] for [[G3754]] you have already received [[G568]] your [[G4771]] comfort. [[G3874]] 
25 Woe [[G3759]] to you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] are well fed [[G1705]] now, [[G3568]] for [[G3754]] you will hunger. [[G3983]] Woe to [[G3759]] [you] who [[G3588]] laugh [[G1070]] now, [[G3568]] for [[G3754]] you will mourn [[G3996]] and [[G2532]] weep. [[G2799]] 
26 Woe to you [[G3759]] when [[G3752]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] speak [[G2036]] well [[G2573]] of you, [[G4771]] for [[G1063]] their [[G846]] fathers [[G3962]] treated [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] false prophets [[G5578]] in the same way. [[G846]] 
27 But [[G235]] to those of you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] will listen, [[G191]] I say: [[G3004]] Love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] enemies, [[G2190]] do [[G4160]] good [[G2573]] to those who [[G3588]] hate [[G3404]] you, [[G4771]] 
28 bless [[G2127]] those who [[G3588]] curse [[G2672]] you, [[G4771]] pray [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] those who [[G3588]] mistreat [[G1908]] you. [[G4771]] 
29 [If someone] strikes [[G5180]] you [[G4771]] on [[G1909]] [one] [[G3588]] cheek, [[G4600]] turn [[G3930]] to him [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] also. [[G2532]] And [[G2532]] [if someone] [[G3588]] takes [[G142]] your [[G4771]] cloak, [[G2440]] do not [[G3361]] withhold [[G2967]] [your] [[G3588]] tunic [[G5509]] as well. [[G2532]] 
30 Give [[G1325]] to everyone who [[G3956]] asks [[G154]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] [if anyone] [[G3588]] takes [[G142]] what [is] [[G3588]] yours, [[G4674]] {do} not [[G3361]] demand [it] back. [[G523]] 
31 Do [[G4160]] to [others] [[G846]] as [[G2531]] you would have [[G2309]] [them] [[G444]] do [[G4160]] to you. [[G4771]] 
32 If [[G1487]] you love [[G25]] those who [[G3588]] love [[G25]] you, [[G4771]] what [[G4169]] credit [[G5485]] is that [[G1510]] to you? [[G4771]] Even [[G2532]] sinners [[G268]] love [[G25]] those who [[G3588]] love [[G25]] them. [[G846]] 
33 If [[G1437]] you do good [[G15]] to those who [[G3588]] do good to [[G15]] you, [[G4771]] what [[G4169]] credit [[G5485]] is that [[G1510]] to you? [[G4771]] Even [[G2532]] sinners [[G268]] do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] same. [[G846]] 
34 And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] you lend [to those] [[G1155]] from [[G3844]] whom [[G3739]] you expect [[G1679]] repayment, [[G2983]] what [[G4169]] credit [[G5485]] is that [[G1510]] to you? [[G4771]] Even [[G2532]] sinners [[G268]] lend [[G1155]] to sinners, [[G268]] expecting [[G2443]] to be repaid [[G618]] in full. [[G2470]] 
35 But [[G4133]] love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] enemies, [[G2190]] do good [to them], [[G15]] and [[G2532]] lend [to them], [[G1155]] expecting nothing in return. [[G560]] Then [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] reward [[G3408]] will be [[G1510]] great, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] you will be [[G1510]] sons of [[G5207]] the Most High; [[G5310]] for [[G3754]] He [[G846]] is [[G1510]] kind [[G5543]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ungrateful [[G884]] and [[G2532]] wicked. [[G4190]] 
36 Be [[G1096]] merciful, [[G3629]] just [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] merciful. [[G3629]] 
37 {Do} not [[G3361]] judge, [[G2919]] and [[G2532]] you will not be judged. [[G2919]] {Do} not [[G3361]] condemn, [[G2613]] and [[G2532]] you will not be condemned. [[G2613]] Forgive, [[G630]] and [[G2532]] you will be forgiven. [[G630]] 
38 Give, [[G1325]] and [[G2532]] it will be given [[G1325]] to you. [[G4771]] A good [[G2570]] measure, [[G3358]] pressed down, [[G4085]] shaken together, [[G4531]] [and] running over [[G5240]] will be poured [[G1325]] into [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] lap. [[G2859]] For [[G1063]] with the [[G3739]] measure [[G3358]] you [use], [[G3354]] it will be measured back [[G488]] to you.” [[G4771]] 
39 [Jesus] also told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] a parable: [[G3850]] “Can [[G1410]] a blind [man] [[G5185]] lead [[G3594]] a blind [man]? [[G5185]] {Will they} not [[G3780]] both [[G297]] fall [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] a pit? [[G999]] 
40 A disciple [[G3101]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] above [[G5228]] [his] [[G3588]] teacher, [[G1320]] but [[G1161]] everyone [who is] [[G3956]] fully trained [[G2675]] will be [[G1510]] like [[G5613]] his [[G846]] teacher. [[G1320]] 
41 Why [[G5101]] do you look at [[G991]] the [[G3588]] speck [[G2595]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] brother’s [[G80]] eye, [[G3788]] but [[G1161]] fail [[G3756]] to notice [[G2657]] [the] beam [[G1385]] in [[G1722]] [your] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] eye? [[G3788]] 
42 How [[G4459]] can you [[G1410]] say, [[G3004]] ‘Brother, [[G80]] let [[G863]] me take [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] speck [[G2595]] {out} [[G3588]] of [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] eye,’ [[G3788]] [while] you yourself [[G846]] fail to see [[G991]] [the] beam [[G1385]] in [[G1722]] your own [[G4771]] eye? [[G3788]] [You] hypocrite, [[G5273]] first [[G4412]] take [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] beam [[G1385]] out of [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] own [[G3588]] eye, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] you will see clearly [[G1227]] to remove [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] speck [[G2595]] from [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] brother’s [[G80]] eye. [[G3788]] 
43 No [[G3756]] good [[G2570]] tree [[G1186]] bears [[G4160]] bad [[G4550]] fruit, [[G2590]] nor [[G3761]] [does] [[G3825]] [a] bad [[G4550]] tree [[G1186]] bear [[G4160]] good [[G2570]] fruit. [[G2590]] 
44 For [[G1063]] each [[G1538]] tree [[G1186]] is known [[G1097]] by [[G1537]] its [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] fruit. [[G2590]] Indeed, [[G1063]] [people] do not gather [[G4816]] figs [[G4810]] from [[G1537]] thornbushes, [[G173]] [or] [[G3761]] grapes [[G4718]] from [[G1537]] brambles. [[G942]] 
45 The [[G3588]] good [[G18]] man [[G444]] brings [[G4393]] good [[G18]] things [[G3588]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] good [[G18]] treasure [[G2344]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] evil [man] [[G4190]] brings [[G4393]] evil [things] [[G4190]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] evil [treasure of his heart]. [[G4190]] For [[G1063]] out of [[G1537]] the overflow [[G4051]] of the heart, [[G2588]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] speaks. [[G2980]] 
46 Why [[G5101]] do you call [[G2564]] Me [[G1473]] ‘Lord, [[G2962]] Lord,’ [[G2962]] [but] [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] I say? [[G3004]] 
47 I will show [[G5263]] you [[G4771]] what [[G5101]] he is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] who [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] hears [[G191]] My [[G1473]] words [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] acts on [[G4160]] them: [[G846]] 
48 He is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] a man [[G444]] building [[G3618]] a house, [[G3614]] who [[G3739]] dug down [[G4626]] deep [[G900]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] [his] foundation [[G2310]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] rock. [[G4073]] When [[G1161]] [the] flood [[G4132]] came, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] torrent [[G4215]] crashed against [[G4366]] that [[G1565]] house [[G3614]] but [[G2532]] could [[G2480]] not [[G3756]] shake [[G4531]] it, [[G846]] because [[G1223]] it [[G846]] was well built. [[G3618]] 
49 But [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] hears [My words] [[G191]] and [[G2532]] {does} not [[G3361]] act on them [[G4160]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] a man [[G444]] who built [[G3618]] [his] house [[G3614]] on [[G1909]] ground [[G1093]] without [[G5565]] [a] foundation. [[G2310]] The [[G3588]] torrent [[G4215]] crashed against [[G4366]] [that house], [[G3739]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] it collapsed [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] was [[G1096]] [its] [[G1565]] destruction. [[G4485]]
