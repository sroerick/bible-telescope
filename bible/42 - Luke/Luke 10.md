# Luke 10
[[Luke 9|←]] • [[Luke 11|→]]
1 After [[G3326]] this, [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] appointed [[G322]] seventy-two [[G1440]] others [[G2087]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] them [[G846]] two by two [[G1417]] ahead of Him [[G4253]] to [[G1519]] every [[G3956]] town [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] place [[G5117]] He [[G846]] was about [[G3195]] to visit. [[G2064]] 
2 And [[G1161]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “The [[G3588]] harvest [is] [[G2326]] plentiful, [[G4183]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] workers [[G2040]] [are] few. [[G3641]] Ask [[G1189]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] harvest, [[G2326]] therefore, [[G3767]] to [[G3704]] send out [[G1544]] workers [[G2040]] into [[G1519]] His [[G846]] harvest. [[G2326]] 
3 Go! [[G5217]] I am sending you out [[G649]] like [[G5613]] lambs [[G704]] among [[G3319]] wolves. [[G3074]] 
4 Carry [[G941]] no [[G3361]] purse [[G905]] [or] [[G3361]] bag [[G4082]] [or] [[G3361]] sandals. [[G5266]] Do not greet [[G782]] [anyone] [[G3367]] along [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] road. [[G3598]] 
5 Whatever [[G3739]] house [[G3614]] you enter, [[G1525]] begin [[G4412]] by saying, [[G3004]] ‘Peace [[G1515]] to this [[G3778]] house.’ [[G3624]] 
6 If [[G1437]] a man [[G5207]] of peace [[G1515]] is [[G1510]] there, [[G1563]] your [[G4771]] peace [[G1515]] will rest [[G1879]] on [[G1909]] him; [[G846]] if [[G1487]] not, [[G1490]] it will return [[G344]] to [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]] 
7 Stay [[G3306]] at [[G1722]] the same [[G846]] house, [[G3614]] eating [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinking [[G4095]] whatever you are [offered]. [[G3588]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] worker [[G2040]] [is] worthy [[G514]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] wages. [[G3408]] {Do} not [[G3361]] move around [[G3327]] from [[G1537]] house [[G3614]] to [[G1519]] house. [[G3614]] 
8 If you enter [[G1525]] a [[G3739]] town [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] they welcome [[G1209]] you, [[G4771]] eat [[G2068]] whatever [[G3588]] is set before [[G3908]] you. [[G4771]] 
9 Heal [[G2323]] the [[G3588]] sick [[G772]] [who are there] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] tell [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] ‘The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is near [[G1448]] you.’ [[G4771]] 
10 But [[G1161]] if you enter [[G1525]] a [[G3739]] town [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] they do not receive [[G1209]] you, [[G4771]] go [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] streets [[G4113]] [and] declare, [[G2036]] 
11 ‘Even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dust [[G2868]] of [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] town [[G4172]] that [[G3588]] clings [[G2853]] to [[G1519]] our [[G1473]] feet, [[G4228]] we wipe off as a testimony [[G631]] against you. [[G4771]] Yet [[G4133]] be sure [[G1097]] of this: [[G3778]] The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is near.’ [[G1448]] 
12 I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] it will be [[G1510]] more bearable [[G414]] on [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] for Sodom [[G4670]] than [[G2228]] for that [[G1565]] town. [[G4172]] 
13 Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] Chorazin! [[G5523]] Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] Bethsaida! [[G966]] For [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] miracles [[G1411]] [that] [[G3588]] were performed [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] had happened [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon, [[G4605]] they would have repented [[G3340]] long ago, [[G3819]] sitting [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] sackcloth [[G4526]] and [[G2532]] ashes. [[G4700]] 
14 But [[G4133]] it will be [[G1510]] more bearable [[G414]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2920]] for Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon [[G4605]] than [[G2228]] for you. [[G4771]] 
15 And [[G2532]] you, [[G4771]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] will you be lifted up [[G5312]] to [[G2193]] heaven? [[G3772]] No, [[G3361]] you will go down [[G2597]] to [[G2193]] Hades! [[G86]] 
16 Whoever [[G3588]] listens [[G191]] to you [[G4771]] listens [[G191]] to Me; [[G1473]] whoever [[G3588]] rejects [[G114]] you [[G4771]] rejects [[G114]] Me; [[G1473]] and [[G1161]] whoever [[G3588]] rejects [[G114]] Me [[G1473]] rejects [[G114]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G649]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
17 The [[G3588]] seventy-two [[G1440]] returned [[G5290]] with [[G3326]] joy [[G5479]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Lord, [[G2962]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] demons [[G1140]] submit [[G5293]] to us [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] Your [[G4771]] name.” [[G3686]] 
18 So [[G1161]] He said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “I saw [[G2334]] Satan [[G4567]] fall [[G4098]] like [[G5613]] lightning [[G796]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]] 
19 See, [[G2400]] I have given [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] authority [[G1849]] to tread [[G3961]] on [[G1883]] snakes [[G3789]] and [[G2532]] scorpions, [[G4651]] and [[G2532]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of the [[G3588]] enemy. [[G2190]] Nothing [[G3762]] will harm [[G91]] you. [[G4771]] 
20 Nevertheless, [[G4133]] {do] not [[G3361]] rejoice [[G5463]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] spirits [[G4151]] submit [[G5293]] to you, [[G4771]] but [[G1161]] rejoice [[G5463]] that [[G3754]] your [[G4771]] names [[G3686]] are written [[G1449]] in [[G1722]] heaven.” [[G3772]] 
21 At [[G1722]] that [[G846]] time, [[G5610]] [Jesus] rejoiced [[G21]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] declared, [[G2036]] “I praise [[G1843]] You, [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] Lord [[G2962]] of heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth, [[G1093]] because [[G3754]] You have hidden [[G613]] these things [[G3778]] from [[G575]] [the] wise [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] learned, [[G4908]] and [[G2532]] revealed [[G601]] them [[G846]] to little children. [[G3516]] Yes, [[G3483]] Father, [[G3962]] for [[G3754]] this [[G3779]] was [[G1096]] well-pleasing [[G2107]] in Your sight. [[G1715]] 
22 All things [[G3956]] have been entrusted [[G3860]] to Me [[G1473]] by [[G5259]] My [[G1473]] Father. [[G3962]] No one [[G3762]] knows [[G1097]] who [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] is [[G1510]] except [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [no one knows] [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] except [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] those to whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] chooses [[G1014]] to reveal [Him]. [[G601]] 
23 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] turned [[G4762]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] [and] said [[G2036]] privately, [[G2398]] “Blessed [are] [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] that [[G3588]] see [[G991]] what [[G3739]] you see. [[G991]] 
24 For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] kings [[G935]] desired [[G2309]] to see [[G3708]] what [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] see [[G991]] [but] [[G2532]] did not see [it], [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] to hear [[G191]] what [[G3739]] you hear [[G191]] [but] [[G2532]] did not hear [it].” [[G191]] 
25 One day [[G2532]] an [[G5100]] expert in the law [[G3544]] stood up [[G450]] to test [[G1598]] Him. [[G846]] “Teacher,” [[G1320]] he asked, [[G3004]] “what [[G5101]] must I do [[G4160]] to inherit [[G2816]] eternal [[G166]] life?” [[G2222]] 
26 “What [[G5101]] is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law?” [[G3551]] [Jesus] replied. [[G2036]] “How [[G4459]] do you read [it]?” [[G314]] 
27 He answered, [[G2036]] “‘Love [[G25]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] God [[G2316]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] heart [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] soul [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] strength [[G2479]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] your [[G4771]] mind [[G1271]] and [[G2532]] ‘[Love] your [[G4771]] neighbor [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] yourself. [[G4572]] 
28 “You have answered [[G611]] correctly,” [[G3723]] [Jesus] said. [[G2036]] “Do [[G4160]] this [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] you will live.” [[G2198]] 
29 But [[G1161]] wanting [[G2309]] to justify [[G1344]] himself, [[G1438]] he asked [[G2036]] Jesus, [[G2424]] “And [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] my [[G1473]] neighbor?” [[G4139]] 
30 Jesus [[G2424]] took up [this question] [[G5274]] and [[G1161]] said, [[G2036]] “A [[G5100]] man [[G444]] was going down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to [[G1519]] Jericho [[G2410]] when [[G2532]] he fell into the hands [[G4045]] of robbers. [[G3027]] [They] [[G3739]] stripped [him], [[G1562]] beat [[G2007]] him, [[G846]] [and] went away, [[G565]] leaving [him] [[G863]] half dead. [[G2253]] 
31 Now [[G1161]] by [[G2596]] chance [[G4795]] a [[G5100]] priest [[G2409]] was going down [[G2597]] the same [[G1565]] road, [[G3598]] but [[G2532]] when he saw [[G3708]] him, [[G846]] he passed by on the other side. [[G492]] 
32 So too, [[G3668]] [when] a Levite [[G3019]] came [[G2064]] to [[G2596]] that [[G3588]] spot [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] saw [him], [[G3708]] he passed by on the other side. [[G492]] 
33 But [when] [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] Samaritan [[G4541]] on a journey [[G3593]] came [[G2064]] upon [[G2596]] him, [[G846]] he looked at [him] [[G3708]] [and] had compassion. [[G4697]] 
34 He went to [him] [[G4334]] [and] bandaged [[G2611]] his [[G846]] wounds, [[G5134]] pouring on [[G2022]] oil [[G1637]] and [[G2532]] wine. [[G3631]] Then [[G1161]] he put [[G1913]] him [[G846]] on [[G1909]] his own [[G2398]] animal, [[G2934]] brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] an inn, [[G3829]] and [[G2532]] took care [[G1959]] of him. [[G846]] 
35 The [[G3588]] next day [[G839]] he took out [[G1544]] two [[G1417]] denarii [[G1220]] [and] gave [them] [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] innkeeper. [[G3830]] ‘Take care [[G1959]] of him,’ [[G846]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘and [[G2532]] on [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] return [[G1880]] I [[G1473]] will repay [[G591]] you [[G4771]] for any additional [[G3739]] expense.’ [[G4325]] 
36 Which [[G5101]] of these [[G3778]] three [[G5140]] {do} you [[G4771]] think [[G1380]] was [[G1096]] a neighbor [[G4139]] to the [man] [[G3588]] who fell into the hands [[G1706]] of [[G1519]] robbers?” [[G3027]] 
37 “The [one] [[G3588]] who showed [[G4160]] him [[G846]] mercy,” [[G1656]] replied [the expert in the law]. [[G2036]] Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “Go [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] likewise.” [[G3668]] 
38 As [[G1161]] they [[G846]] traveled along, [[G4198]] [Jesus] [[G846]] entered [[G1525]] a [[G5100]] village [[G2968]] [where] [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] woman [[G1135]] named [[G3686]] Martha [[G3136]] welcomed [[G5264]] Him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] [her] [[G3588]] home. [[G3614]] 
39 She [[G3592]] had [[G1510]] a sister [[G79]] named [[G2564]] Mary, [[G3137]] who [[G3739]] sat [[G3869]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] feet, [[G4228]] listening to [[G191]] His [[G846]] message. [[G3056]] 
40 But [[G1161]] Martha [[G3136]] was distracted [[G4049]] by all the [[G4012]] preparations [to be made]. [[G1248]] She came to [Jesus] [[G2186]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Lord, [[G2962]] do You not care [[G3199]] that [[G3754]] my [[G1473]] sister [[G79]] has left [[G2641]] me [[G1473]] to serve [[G1247]] alone? [[G3441]] Tell [[G2036]] her [[G846]] to [[G2443]] help [[G4878]] me! [[G1473]] 
41 “Martha, [[G3136]] Martha,” [[G3136]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] replied, [[G611]] “you are worried [[G3309]] and [[G2532]] upset [[G2350]] about [[G4012]] many things. [[G4183]] 
42 But [[G1161]] only [[G2228]] one [[G1520]] thing [[G3641]] is [[G1510]] necessary. [[G5532]] Mary [[G3137]] has chosen [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] good [[G18]] portion, [[G3310]] [and it] [[G3748]] will not be taken away from [[G851]] her.” [[G846]]
