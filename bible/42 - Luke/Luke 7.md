# Luke 7
[[Luke 6|←]] • [[Luke 8|→]]
1 When [[G1894]] [Jesus] had concluded [[G4137]] His [[G846]] discourse [[G4487]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] hearing [[G189]] of the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] He went [[G1525]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum. [[G2584]] 
2 [There] [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] highly valued [[G1784]] servant [[G1401]] of a centurion [[G1543]] was [[G2192]] sick [[G2560]] [and] about [[G3195]] to die. [[G5053]] 
3 When [[G1161]] [the centurion] heard [[G191]] about [[G4012]] Jesus, [[G2424]] he sent [[G649]] [some] [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] elders [[G4245]] to ask [[G2065]] Him [[G846]] to come [[G2064]] [and] heal [[G1295]] his [[G846]] servant. [[G1401]] 
4 They came [[G3854]] to [[G4314]] Jesus [[G2424]] [and] pleaded with [[G3870]] Him [[G846]] earnestly, [[G4709]] “[This man] is [[G1510]] worthy [[G514]] to have You grant [[G3930]] this, [[G3778]] 
5 for [[G1063]] he loves [[G25]] our [[G1473]] nation [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] has built [[G3618]] our [[G1473]] synagogue.” [[G4864]] 
6 So [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G4198]] with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]] But [[G1161]] when [[G2235]] He [[G846]] was not far [[G568]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] sent [[G3992]] friends [[G5384]] with the message: [[G3004]] “Lord, [[G2962]] {do} not [[G3361]] trouble Yourself, [[G4660]] for [[G1063]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] to have [[G2443]] You come [[G1525]] under [[G5259]] my [[G1473]] roof. [[G4721]] 
7 That is why [[G1352]] I did not consider myself worthy [[G515]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] You. [[G4771]] But [just] [[G235]] say [[G2036]] [the] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] servant [[G3816]] will be healed. [[G2390]] 
8 For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] [myself] [[G2532]] am [[G1510]] a man [[G444]] under [[G5259]] authority, [[G1849]] with [[G2192]] soldiers [[G4757]] under [[G5259]] me. [[G1683]] I tell [[G3004]] [one] [[G3778]] to go, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] he goes; [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] to come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] he comes. [[G2064]] [I tell] [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] servant [[G1401]] to do [[G4160]] [something], [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] he does [it]. [[G4160]] 
9 [When] [[G1161]] [Jesus] heard [[G191]] [this], [[G3778]] [He] [[G2424]] was amazed at [[G2296]] [the centurion]. [[G846]] Turning [[G4762]] to the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] following [[G190]] Him, [[G846]] He said, [[G2036]] “I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] not even [[G3761]] in [[G1722]] Israel [[G2474]] have I found [[G2147]] such great [[G5118]] faith! [[G4102]] 
10 And [when] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] messengers [[G3992]] returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3624]] they found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] in good health. [[G5198]] 
11 Soon afterward, [[G1096]] [Jesus] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] a town [[G4172]] called [[G2564]] Nain. [[G3484]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] went with [[G4848]] Him, [[G846]] accompanied by [[G2532]] a large [[G4183]] crowd. [[G3793]] 
12 As [[G5613]] He approached [[G1448]] the [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] gate, [[G4439]] He saw [[G2400]] a dead man [[G2348]] being carried out, [[G1580]] the only [[G3439]] son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] she [[G846]] was [[G1510]] a widow. [[G5503]] And [[G2532]] a sizeable [[G2425]] crowd [[G3793]] from the [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] was [[G1510]] with [[G4862]] her. [[G846]] 
13 When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] saw [[G3708]] her, [[G846]] He had compassion [[G4697]] on [[G1909]] her [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] weep.” [[G2799]] 
14 Then [[G2532]] He went up [[G4334]] [and] touched [[G680]] the [[G3588]] coffin, [[G4673]] and [[G1161]] those [[G3588]] carrying it [[G941]] stood still. [[G2476]] “Young man,” [[G3495]] He said, [[G2036]] “I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] get up!” [[G1453]] 
15 And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dead [man] [[G3498]] sat up [[G339]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to speak! [[G2980]] Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] gave [[G1325]] him {back} [[G846]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] mother. [[G3384]] 
16 A sense of awe [[G5401]] swept over [[G2983]] all [of them], [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] they glorified [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]] “A great [[G3173]] prophet [[G4396]] has appeared [[G1453]] among [[G1722]] us!” [[G1473]] they said. [[G3004]] “God [[G2316]] has visited [[G1980]] His [[G846]] people!” [[G2992]] 
17 And [[G2532]] [the] [[G3778]] news [[G3056]] about [[G4012]] [Jesus] [[G846]] spread [[G1831]] throughout [[G1722]] Judea [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] surrounding region. [[G4066]] 
18 Then [[G2532]] [John’s] [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] informed [[G518]] [him] [[G2491]] about [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] these things. [[G3778]] 
19 So [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] called [[G4341]] two [[G1417]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] [and] sent [them] [[G3992]] to [[G4314]] ask [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] “Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] One who was to come, [[G2064]] or [[G2228]] should we look for [[G4328]] someone else?” [[G243]] 
20 The [[G3588]] men [[G435]] came [[G3854]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus] [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G910]] sent [[G649]] us [[G1473]] to [[G4314]] ask, [[G3004]] ‘Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] One who was to come, [[G2064]] or [[G2228]] should we look for [[G4328]] someone else? [[G243]] 
21 At [[G1722]] that very [[G1565]] hour [[G5610]] [Jesus] healed [[G2323]] many [people] [[G4183]] of [[G575]] [their] diseases, [[G3554]] afflictions, [[G3148]] and [[G2532]] evil [[G4190]] spirits, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] He gave [[G5483]] sight [[G991]] to many [who were] [[G4183]] blind. [[G5185]] 
22 So [[G2532]] He replied, [[G611]] “Go [back] [[G4198]] [and] report [[G518]] to John [[G2491]] what [[G3739]] you have seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] heard: [[G191]] [The] blind [[G5185]] receive sight, [[G308]] [the] lame [[G5560]] walk, [[G4043]] [the] lepers [[G3015]] are cleansed, [[G2511]] [the] deaf [[G2974]] hear, [[G191]] [the] dead [[G3498]] are raised, [[G1453]] [and the] good news is preached [[G2097]] [to the] poor. [[G4434]] 
23 Blessed [[G3107]] is [[G1510]] the [one who] [[G3739]] does not fall away [[G4624]] on account of [[G1722]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
24 After [[G1161]] John’s [[G2491]] messengers [[G32]] had left, [[G565]] [Jesus] began [[G756]] to speak [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] about [[G4012]] John: [[G2491]] “What [[G5101]] did you go out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] to see? [[G2300]] A reed [[G2563]] swaying [[G4531]] in [[G5259]] [the] wind? [[G417]] 
25 If not, [[G235]] what [[G5101]] did you go out [[G1831]] to see? [[G3708]] A man [[G444]] dressed [[G294]] in [[G1722]] fine [[G3120]] clothes? [[G2440]] Look, [[G2400]] those who [[G3588]] [wear] [[G1722]] elegant [[G1741]] clothing [[G2441]] and [[G2532]] live [[G5225]] in luxury [[G5172]] are found [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] palaces. [[G934]] 
26 But [[G235]] what [[G5101]] did you go out [[G1831]] to see? [[G3708]] A prophet? [[G4396]] Yes, [[G3483]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] more [[G4053]] than a prophet. [[G4396]] 
27 This [[G3778]] is the one [[G1510]] about [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] it is written: [[G1125]] ‘Behold, [[G2400]] I will send [[G649]] My [[G1473]] messenger [[G32]] ahead of You, [[G4253]] who [[G3739]] will prepare [[G2680]] Your [[G4771]] way [[G3598]] before [[G1715]] You.’ [[G4771]] 
28 I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] among [[G1722]] [those] born [[G1084]] of women [[G1135]] there is [[G1510]] no one [[G3762]] greater [[G3173]] than John, [[G2491]] yet even [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] least [[G3398]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] greater [[G3173]] than he.” [[G846]] 
29 All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] [who] heard [this], [[G191]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] tax collectors, [[G5057]] acknowledged God’s justice. [[G1344]] [For] they had received the baptism [[G907]] of John. [[G2491]] 
30 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] experts in the law [[G3544]] rejected [[G114]] God’s [[G2316]] purpose [[G1012]] for [[G1519]] themselves, [[G1438]] [because] {they had} not [[G3361]] been baptized [[G907]] by [[G5259]] [John]. [[G846]] 
31 “To what, [[G5101]] then, [[G3767]] can I compare [[G3666]] the [[G3588]] men [[G444]] of this [[G3778]] generation? [[G1074]] What [[G5101]] are they [[G1510]] like? [[G3664]] 
32 They are [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] children [[G3813]] sitting [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] [the] marketplace [[G58]] and [[G2532]] calling out [[G4377]] to one another: [[G240]] ‘We played the flute [[G832]] for you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you did not dance; [[G3738]] we sang a dirge, [[G2354]] and [[G2532]] you did not weep.’ [[G2799]] 
33 For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G910]] came [[G2064]] neither [[G3361]] eating [[G2068]] bread [[G740]] nor [[G3383]] drinking [[G4095]] wine, [[G3631]] and [[G2532]] you say, [[G3004]] ‘He has [[G2192]] a demon!’ [[G1140]] 
34 The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] came [[G2064]] eating [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinking, [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] you say, [[G3004]] ‘Look [[G2400]] [at this] [[G444]] glutton [[G5314]] and [[G2532]] drunkard, [[G3630]] a friend [[G5384]] of tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] of sinners!’ [[G268]] 
35 But [[G2532]] wisdom [[G4678]] is vindicated [[G1344]] by [[G575]] all [[G3956]] her [[G846]] children.” [[G5043]] 
36 Then [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] invited [[G2065]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to [[G2443]] eat [[G5315]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] Pharisee’s [[G5330]] house [[G3624]] [and] reclined at the table. [[G2625]] 
37 When [[G2532]] a sinful [[G268]] woman [[G1135]] from [[G1722]] [that] [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] learned [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] was dining [[G2621]] [there], [[G3614]] she brought [[G2865]] an alabaster jar [[G211]] of perfume. [[G3464]] 
38 [As] [[G2532]] she stood [[G2476]] behind Him [[G3694]] at [[G3844]] His [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] weeping, [[G2799]] she began [[G756]] to wet [[G1026]] His [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] with [[G3588]] [her] [[G3588]] tears [[G1144]] and [[G2532]] wipe [them] [[G1591]] with [[G3588]] her hair. [[G2359]] Then [[G2532]] she kissed [[G2705]] His [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] anointed [them] [[G218]] with the [[G3588]] perfume. [[G3464]] 
39 When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisee [[G5330]] who [[G3588]] had invited [[G2564]] [Jesus] [[G846]] saw [this], [[G3708]] he said [[G2036]] to [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] “If [[G1487]] this [man] [[G3778]] were [[G1510]] a prophet, [[G4396]] He would know [[G1097]] who [this is] [[G5101]] and [[G2532]] what kind [[G4217]] of [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] is touching [[G680]] Him [[G846]] for [[G3754]] she is [[G1510]] a sinner! [[G268]] 
40 But [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] “Simon, [[G4613]] I have [[G2192]] something [[G5100]] to tell [[G2036]] you.” [[G4771]] “Tell [me], [[G2036]] Teacher,” [[G1320]] he said. [[G5346]] 
41 “Two [men] [[G1417]] were [[G1510]] debtors [[G5533]] to a certain moneylender. [[G1157]] One [[G1520]] owed [him] [[G3784]] five hundred [[G4001]] denarii, [[G1220]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] fifty. [[G4004]] 
42 [When] they [[G846]] were unable [[G2192]] to repay [him], [[G591]] he forgave [[G5483]] both [of them]. [[G297]] Which [[G5101]] [one], [[G846]] then, [[G3767]] will love [[G25]] him [[G846]] more?” [[G4119]] 
43 “I suppose [[G5274]] the [one who] [[G3739]] was forgiven [[G5483]] more,” [[G4119]] Simon [[G4613]] replied. [[G611]] “You have judged [[G2919]] correctly.” [[G3723]] [Jesus] said. [[G2036]] 
44 And [[G2532]] turning [[G4762]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] He said [[G5346]] to Simon, [[G4613]] “Do you see [[G991]] this [[G3778]] woman? [[G1135]] [When] I entered [[G1525]] your [[G4771]] house, [[G3614]] you did not give [Me] [[G1325]] water [[G5204]] for [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] feet, [[G4228]] but [[G1161]] she wet [[G1026]] My [[G1473]] feet [[G4228]] with her [[G3778]] tears [[G1144]] and [[G2532]] wiped [them] [[G1591]] with [[G3588]] her [[G846]] hair. [[G2359]] 
45 You did not greet [[G1325]] Me [[G1473]] with a kiss, [[G5370]] but [[G1161]] she [[G3778]] has not stopped [[G1257]] kissing [[G2705]] My [[G1473]] feet [[G4228]] since [[G575]] I arrived. [[G1525]] 
46 You did not anoint [[G218]] My [[G1473]] head [[G2776]] with oil, [[G1637]] but [[G1161]] she [[G3778]] has anointed [[G218]] My [[G1473]] feet [[G4228]] with perfume. [[G3464]] 
47 Therefore [[G5484]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] because [[G3754]] her [[G846]] many [[G4183]] sins [[G266]] have been forgiven, [[G863]] she has loved [[G25]] much. [[G4183]] But [[G1161]] he who [[G3739]] has been forgiven [[G863]] little [[G3641]] loves [[G25]] little.” [[G3641]] 
48 Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to her, [[G846]] “Your [[G4771]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven.” [[G863]] 
49 But [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] at the table [[G4873]] began [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] to [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] “Who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] who [[G3739]] even [[G2532]] forgives [[G863]] sins?” [[G266]] 
50 And [[G1161]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] “Your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] has saved [[G4982]] you; [[G4771]] go [[G4198]] in [[G1519]] peace.” [[G1515]]
