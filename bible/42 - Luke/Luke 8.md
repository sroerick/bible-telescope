1 Soon [[G2517]] afterward, [[G1722]] [Jesus] [[G846]] traveled [[G1353]] from one [[G2596]] town [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] village {to another}, [[G2968]] preaching [[G2784]] and [[G2532]] proclaiming the good news [[G2097]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]] The [[G3588]] Twelve [[G1427]] [were] with [[G4862]] Him, [[G846]] 
2 as well as [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] women [[G1135]] who [[G3739]] had been [[G1510]] healed [[G2323]] of [[G575]] evil [[G4190]] spirits [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] infirmities: [[G769]] Mary [[G3137]] called [[G2564]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] from [[G575]] whom [[G3739]] seven [[G2033]] demons [[G1140]] had gone out, [[G1831]] 
3 Joanna [[G2489]] [the] wife [[G1135]] of Herod’s [[G2264]] household manager [[G2012]] Chuza, [[G5529]] Susanna, [[G4677]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] others. [[G2087]] [These women] [[G3748]] were ministering [[G1247]] to them [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] their own [[G846]] means. [[G5225]] 
4 [While] [[G1161]] a large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] was gathering [[G4896]] and [[G2532]] [people] [[G3588]] were coming [[G1975]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus] [[G846]] from town after town, [[G4172]] He told [them] [[G2036]] [this] parable: [[G3850]] 
5 “A farmer [[G4687]] went out [[G1831]] to sow [[G4687]] his [[G846]] seed. [[G4703]] And [[G2532]] as [[G1722]] he [[G846]] was sowing, [[G4687]] some [seed] [[G3739]] fell [[G4098]] along [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] path, [[G3598]] where [[G2532]] it was trampled, [[G2662]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G4071]] of the [[G3588]] air [[G3772]] devoured [[G2719]] it. [[G846]] 
6 Other [seed] [[G2087]] fell [[G2667]] on [[G1909]] rocky ground, [[G4073]] and [[G2532]] when it came up, [[G5453]] [the seedlings] withered [[G3583]] because [[G1223]] they had [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] moisture. [[G2429]] 
7 Other [seed] [[G2087]] fell [[G4098]] among [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] thorns, [[G173]] [which] [[G173]] grew up with [it] [[G4855]] [and] choked [[G638]] [the seedlings]. [[G846]] 
8 Still [[G2532]] other [seed] [[G2087]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1519]] good [[G18]] soil, [[G1093]] [where] [[G2532]] it sprang up [[G5453]] [and] produced [[G4160]] a crop— [[G2590]] a hundredfold.” [[G1542]] As [Jesus] said [[G3004]] [this], [[G3778]] He called out, [[G5455]] “He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear.” [[G191]] 
9 Then [[G1161]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G1905]] Him [[G846]] what [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] parable [[G3850]] meant. [[G1510]] 
10 He replied, [[G2036]] “The knowledge [[G1097]] of the [[G3588]] mysteries [[G3466]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] has been given [[G1325]] to you, [[G4771]] but [[G1161]] to [[G3588]] others [[G3062]] [I speak] in [[G1722]] parables, [[G3850]] so that, [[G2443]] ‘[Though] seeing, [[G991]] they may not see; [[G991]] [though] hearing, [[G191]] they may not understand.’ [[G4920]] 
11 Now [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] is the meaning [[G1510]] of the [[G3588]] parable: [[G3850]] The [[G3588]] seed [[G4703]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God. [[G2316]] 
12 The [ seeds ] [[G3588]] along [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] path [[G3598]] are [[G1510]] those who [[G3588]] hear, [[G191]] [but] [[G1534]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] comes [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] takes away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] so that [[G2443]] they may not believe [[G4100]] [and] be saved. [[G4982]] 
13 The [ seeds ] [[G3588]] on [[G1909]] rocky ground [[G4073]] [are] those who [[G3739]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] [and] receive it [[G1209]] with [[G3326]] joy, [[G5479]] but [[G2532]] [they] [[G3778]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] root. [[G4491]] [They] [[G3739]] believe [[G4100]] for [[G4314]] a season, [[G2540]] [but] [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] [the] time [[G2540]] of testing, [[G3986]] they fall away. [[G868]] 
14 The [ seeds that ] [[G3588]] fell [[G4098]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] thorns [[G173]] are [[G1510]] those who [[G3588]] hear, [[G191]] [but] [[G2532]] as they go on their way, [[G4198]] they are choked [[G4846]] by [[G5259]] [the] worries, [[G3308]] riches, [[G4149]] and [[G2532]] pleasures [[G2237]] of [this] [[G3588]] life, [[G979]] and [[G2532]] their fruit does not mature. [[G5052]] 
15 But [[G1161]] the [seeds] [[G3588]] on [[G1722]] good [[G2570]] soil [[G1093]] are [[G1510]] those [[G3748]] with [[G1722]] a noble [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] good [[G18]] heart, [[G2588]] [who] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] cling to [it], [[G2722]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] persevering [[G5281]] produce a crop. [[G2592]] 
16 No one [[G3762]] lights [[G681]] a lamp [[G3088]] [and] covers [[G2572]] it [[G846]] with a jar [[G4632]] or [[G2228]] puts [it] [[G5087]] under [[G5270]] a bed. [[G2825]] Instead, [[G235]] he sets [it] [[G5087]] on [[G1909]] a lampstand, [[G3087]] so [[G2443]] those who [[G3588]] enter [[G1531]] can see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] light. [[G5457]] 
17 For [[G1063]] there is [[G1510]] nothing [[G3756]] hidden [[G2927]] that [[G3739]] will not be [[G1096]] revealed, [[G5318]] [and] nothing [[G3761]] concealed [[G614]] that [[G3739]] will not be known [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] illuminated. [[G5318]] 
18 Pay attention, [[G991]] therefore, [[G3767]] to how [[G4459]] you listen. [[G191]] Whoever [[G3739]] has [[G2192]] will be given [more], [[G1325]] [but] [[G2532]] whoever [[G3739]] does not have, [[G2192]] even [[G2532]] what [[G3739]] he thinks [[G1380]] he has [[G2192]] will be taken away [[G142]] from [[G575]] him.” [[G846]] 
19 Then [[G1161]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] came [[G3854]] to [see] [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G2532]] they were unable [[G1410]] to reach [[G4940]] Him [[G846]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] crowd. [[G3793]] 
20 He was told, [[G518]] “Your [[G4771]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] Your [[G4771]] brothers [[G80]] are standing [[G2476]] outside, [[G1854]] wanting [[G2309]] to see [[G3708]] You.” [[G4771]] 
21 But [[G1161]] He replied, [[G611]] “My [[G1473]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] are [[G1510]] those [[G3778]] who [[G3588]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] carry it out.” [[G4160]] 
22 One [[G1520]] day [[G2250]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] [His disciples], [[G846]] “Let us cross [[G1330]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side [[G4008]] of the [[G3588]] lake.” [[G3041]] So [[G2532]] He [[G846]] got into [[G1684]] a boat [[G4143]] [with] [[G2532]] [them] [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] set out. [[G321]] 
23 As they [[G846]] sailed, [[G4126]] He fell asleep, [[G879]] and [[G2532]] a squall [[G2978]] came down [[G2597]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake, [[G3041]] so that [[G2532]] [the boat] was being swamped, [[G4845]] and [[G2532]] they were in great danger. [[G2793]] 
24 [The disciples] went [[G4334]] [and] woke [[G1326]] Him [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] “Master, [[G1988]] Master, [[G1988]] we are perishing!” [[G622]] Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] got up [[G1326]] [and] rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] raging [[G2830]] waters, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] they subsided, [[G3973]] and [[G2532]] [all] was [[G1096]] calm. [[G1055]] 
25 “Where is [[G4226]] your [[G4771]] faith?” [[G4102]] He asked. [[G2036]] Frightened [[G5399]] [and] amazed, [[G2296]] they asked [[G3004]] one another, [[G240]] “Who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] this? [[G3778]] He commands [[G2004]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] they obey [[G5219]] Him!” [[G846]] 
26 They sailed [[G2668]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] region [[G5561]] of the [[G3588]] Gerasenes, [[G1086]] across [the lake] from [[G495]] Galilee. [[G1056]] 
27 When [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] stepped [[G1831]] ashore, [[G1093]] He was met by [[G5221]] a [[G5100]] demon-possessed [[G1140]] man [[G435]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] town. [[G4172]] For a long [[G2425]] time [[G5550]] [this man] had not worn [[G1746]] clothing [[G2440]] [or] [[G2532]] lived [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] a house, [[G3614]] but [he stayed] [[G235]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tombs. [[G3418]] 
28 When [[G1161]] he saw [[G3708]] Jesus, [[G2424]] he cried out [[G349]] [and] fell down before [[G4363]] Him, [[G846]] shouting in a loud voice, [[G5456]] “What [[G5101]] do You [[G4771]] [want] with me, [[G1473]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] Most High [[G5310]] God? [[G2316]] I beg [[G1189]] You [[G4771]] not [[G3361]] to torture [[G928]] me! [[G1473]] 
29 For [[G1063]] [Jesus] had commanded [[G3853]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] to come out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] man. [[G444]] Many [[G4183]] times [[G5550]] it had seized [[G4884]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [though] he was bound [[G1195]] with [[G5442]] chains [[G254]] and [[G2532]] shackles, [[G3976]] he had broken [[G1284]] the [[G3588]] chains [[G1199]] [and] been driven [[G1643]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] demon [[G1140]] into [[G1519]] solitary places. [[G2048]] 
30 “What [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] name?” [[G3686]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked. [[G1905]] “Legion,” [[G3003]] he answered, [[G2036]] because [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] demons [[G1140]] had gone [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] him. [[G846]] 
31 And [[G2532]] [the demons] kept begging [[G3870]] [Jesus] [[G846]] not [[G3361]] to order [[G2004]] them [[G846]] to go [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Abyss. [[G12]] 
32 There [[G1563]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] hillside [[G3735]] a large [[G2425]] herd [[G34]] of pigs [[G5519]] was [[G1510]] feeding. [[G1006]] [So] [[G2532]] [the demons] begged [[G3870]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to [[G2443]] let [[G2010]] them [[G846]] enter [[G1525]] [the pigs], [[G1565]] and [[G2532]] He permitted [[G2010]] them. [[G846]] 
33 Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] demons [[G1140]] came out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] [and] went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] pigs, [[G5519]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] herd [[G34]] rushed [[G3729]] down [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] steep bank [[G2911]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] and [[G2532]] was drowned. [[G638]] 
34 When [[G1161]] those [[G3588]] tending [the pigs] [[G1006]] saw [[G3708]] what [[G3588]] had happened, [[G1096]] they ran off [[G5343]] and [[G2532]] reported [this] [[G518]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] countryside. [[G68]] 
35 [So] [[G1161]] [the people] went out [[G1831]] to see [[G3708]] what [[G3588]] had happened. [[G1096]] They came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] demons [[G1140]] had left, [[G1831]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G3844]] Jesus’ [[G2424]] feet, [[G4228]] clothed [[G2439]] and [[G2532]] in his right mind; [[G4993]] and [[G2532]] they were afraid. [[G5399]] 
36 Meanwhile, [[G1161]] those who [[G3588]] had seen [it] [[G3708]] told [[G518]] them [[G846]] how [[G4459]] the [[G3588]] demon-possessed man [[G1139]] had been healed. [[G4982]] 
37 Then [[G2532]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] people [[G4128]] of the [[G3588]] region [[G4066]] of the [[G3588]] Gerasenes [[G1086]] asked [[G2065]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to depart [[G565]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] great [[G3173]] fear [[G5401]] had swept over them. [[G4912]] So [[G1161]] He [[G846]] got [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the boat [[G4143]] [and] started back. [[G5290]] 
38 The [[G3588]] man [[G435]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] demons [[G1140]] had left [[G1831]] begged [[G1189]] to go [[G1510]] with [[G4862]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] But [[G1161]] He sent him away, [[G630]] saying, [[G3004]] 
39 “Return [[G5290]] home [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] tell [[G1334]] how much [[G3745]] God [[G2316]] has done [[G4160]] for you.” [[G4771]] So [[G2532]] [the man] went [[G565]] [and] proclaimed [[G2784]] all [[G3650]] over [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] how much [[G3745]] Jesus [[G2424]] had done [[G4160]] for him. [[G846]] 
40 When [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] returned, [[G5290]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] welcomed [[G588]] Him, [[G846]] for [[G1063]] they had all been [[G1510]] waiting for [[G4328]] Him. [[G846]] 
41 Just then, [[G2532]] [a] [[G435]] synagogue [[G4864]] leader [[G758]] named [[G3686]] Jairus [[G2383]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] fell [[G4098]] at [[G3844]] Jesus’ [[G2424]] feet. [[G4228]] He begged [[G3870]] Him [[G846]] to come [[G1525]] to [[G1519]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] 
42 because [[G3754]] his [[G846]] only [[G3439]] daughter, [[G2364]] [who was] about [[G5613]] twelve, [[G1427]] was dying. [[G599]] As [[G1722]] [Jesus] [[G846]] went [with him], [[G5217]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] pressed around [[G4846]] Him, [[G846]] 
43 including [[G2532]] a woman [[G1135]] who had been [[G1510]] subject to bleeding [[G129]] for [[G575]] twelve [[G1427]] years. [[G2094]] [She] [[G3748]] had spent [[G4321]] all [[G3650]] her [[G3588]] money [[G979]] on physicians, [[G2395]] [but] [[G575]] no one [[G3762]] was able [[G2480]] to heal [her]. [[G2323]] 
44 She came up [[G4334]] behind [Jesus] [[G3693]] [and] touched [[G680]] the [[G3588]] fringe [[G2899]] of His [[G846]] cloak, [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G3916]] her [[G846]] bleeding [[G129]] stopped. [[G2476]] 
45 “Who [[G5101]] touched [[G680]] Me?” [[G1473]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked. [[G2036]] But [[G1161]] they all [[G3956]] denied [it]. [[G720]] “Master,” [[G1988]] said [[G2036]] Peter, [[G4074]] “the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] are crowding [[G4912]] and [[G2532]] pressing against [[G598]] You.” [[G4771]] 
46 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared, [[G2036]] “Someone [[G5100]] touched [[G680]] Me, [[G1473]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] know that [[G1097]] power [[G1411]] has gone out [[G1831]] from [[G575]] Me.” [[G1473]] 
47 Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] seeing [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] she could not escape notice, [[G2990]] came [[G2064]] trembling [[G5141]] and [[G2532]] fell down before [[G4363]] Him. [[G846]] In the presence of [[G1799]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] she explained [[G518]] why [[G156]] she had touched [[G680]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] how [[G5613]] she had immediately been healed. [[G2390]] 
48 “Daughter,” [[G2364]] said [Jesus], [[G2036]] “your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] has healed [[G4982]] you. [[G4771]] Go [[G4198]] in [[G1519]] peace.” [[G1515]] 
49 [While] He [[G846]] {was} still [[G2089]] speaking, [[G2980]] someone [[G5100]] arrived [[G2064]] from [[G3844]] the [house of] [[G3588]] the synagogue leader. [[G752]] “Your [[G4771]] daughter [[G2364]] is dead,” [[G2348]] he told [Jairus]. [[G3004]] “{Do not} trouble [[G4660]] the [[G3588]] Teacher [[G1320]] [anymore].” [[G3371]] 
50 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] overheard [them] [[G191]] [and] said [[G611]] to [Jairus], [[G846]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid; [[G5399]] just [[G3440]] believe, [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] she will be healed.” [[G4982]] 
51 When [[G1161]] He entered [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] He did not allow [[G863]] anyone [[G5100]] to go in [[G1525]] with [[G4862]] Him [[G846]] except [[G1487]] Peter, [[G4074]] John, [[G2491]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] child’s [[G3816]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother. [[G3384]] 
52 Meanwhile [[G1161]] everyone [[G3956]] was weeping [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] mourning for [[G2875]] her. [[G846]] But [[G1161]] [Jesus] said, [[G2036]] “Stop weeping; [[G2799]] she is not dead [[G599]] but [[G235]] asleep.” [[G2518]] 
53 And [[G2532]] they laughed at [[G2606]] Him, [[G846]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] she was dead. [[G599]] 
54 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] took [[G2902]] her [[G846]] by the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] [and] called out, [[G5455]] “Child, [[G3816]] get up!” [[G1453]] 
55 Her [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] returned, [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] at once [[G3916]] she got up. [[G450]] And [[G2532]] He directed that [[G1299]] she [[G846]] be given [something] [[G1325]] to eat. [[G5315]] 
56 Her [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] were astonished, [[G1839]] but [[G1161]] [Jesus] ordered [[G3853]] them [[G846]] {not} to tell [[G2036]] [anyone] [[G3367]] what [[G3588]] had happened. [[G1096]]
