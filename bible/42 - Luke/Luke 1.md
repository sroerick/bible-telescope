[[Mark 16|←]] • [[Luke 2|→]]
1 Many [[G4183]] have undertaken [[G2021]] to compose [[G392]] an account [[G1335]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] things that [[G4229]] have been fulfilled [[G4135]] among [[G1722]] us, [[G1473]] 
2 just as [[G2531]] they [[G3588]] were handed down [[G3860]] to us [[G1473]] by [[G575]] the initial [[G746]] eyewitnesses [[G845]] and [[G2532]] servants [[G5257]] of the [[G3588]] word. [[G3056]] 
3 Therefore, having carefully investigated [[G3877]] everything [[G3956]] from the beginning, [[G509]] it seemed good [[G1380]] also to me [[G2504]] to write [[G1125]] an orderly account [[G2517]] for you, [[G4771]] most excellent [[G2903]] Theophilus, [[G2321]] 
4 so that [[G2443]] you may know [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] certainty [[G803]] of [[G4012]] [the] things [[G3056]] you have been taught. [[G2727]] 
5 In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2250]] of Herod [[G2264]] king [[G935]] of Judea, [[G2449]] there was [[G1096]] a [[G5100]] priest [[G2409]] named [[G3686]] Zechariah, [[G2197]] who belonged to [[G1537]] [the] priestly division [[G2183]] of Abijah, [[G7]] and [[G2532]] [whose] [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] Elizabeth [[G1665]] [was] [[G1537]] a [[G3588]] daughter [[G2364]] of Aaron. [[G2]] 
6 They were [[G1510]] both [[G297]] righteous [[G1342]] in the sight of [[G1726]] God, [[G2316]] walking [[G4198]] blamelessly [[G273]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] commandments [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] decrees [[G1345]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] 
7 But [[G2532]] they [[G846]] had [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] children, [[G5043]] because [[G2530]] Elizabeth [[G1665]] was [[G1510]] barren, [[G4723]] and [[G2532]] both {of them} [[G297]] were [[G1510]] well along [[G4260]] in [[G1722]] years. [[G2250]] 
8 One day [[G1161]] while [[G3588]] [Zechariah’s] [[G846]] division [[G2183]] was on duty [[G5010]] [and] [[G1722]] he [[G846]] was serving as priest [[G2407]] before [[G1725]] God, [[G2316]] 
9 he was chosen by lot, [[G2975]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] custom [[G1485]] of the [[G3588]] priesthood, [[G2405]] to enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] [and] burn incense. [[G2370]] 
10 And [[G2532]] at the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] of the [[G3588]] incense offering, [[G2368]] the [[G3588]] entire [[G3956]] congregation [[G4128]] was [[G1510]] praying [[G4336]] outside. [[G1854]] 
11 Just then, [[G1161]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] appeared [[G3708]] to [Zechariah], [[G846]] standing [[G2476]] at [[G1537]] [the] right side [[G1188]] of the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] of the [[G3588]] incense. [[G2368]] 
12 When [[G2532]] Zechariah [[G2197]] saw [him], [[G3708]] he was startled [[G5015]] and [[G2532]] overcome [[G1968]] with fear. [[G5401]] 
13 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid, [[G5399]] Zechariah, [[G2197]] because [[G1360]] your [[G4771]] prayer [[G1162]] has been heard. [[G1522]] Your [[G4771]] wife [[G1135]] Elizabeth [[G1665]] will bear [[G1080]] you [[G4771]] a son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] you shall give [[G2564]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] John. [[G2491]] 
14 He will be [[G1510]] a joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] delight [[G20]] to you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] will rejoice [[G5463]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] birth, [[G1078]] 
15 for [[G1063]] he will be [[G1510]] great [[G3173]] in the sight [[G1799]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] He shall never take [[G4095]] wine [[G3631]] [or] [[G2532]] strong drink, [[G4608]] and [[G2532]] he will be filled [[G4130]] [with the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] even [[G2089]] from [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mother’s [[G3384]] womb. [[G2836]] 
16 Many [[G4183]] of the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of Israel [[G2474]] he will turn [[G1994]] back to [[G1909]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] their [[G846]] God. [[G2316]] 
17 And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] will go on [[G4281]] before [[G1799]] [the Lord] [[G846]] in [[G1722]] [the] spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] power [[G1411]] of Elijah, [[G2243]] to turn [[G1994]] [the] hearts [[G2588]] of [the] fathers [[G3962]] to [[G1909]] [their] children, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] [the] disobedient [[G545]] to [[G1722]] [the] wisdom [[G5428]] of [the] righteous— [[G1342]] to make ready [[G2090]] a people [[G2992]] prepared [[G2680]] for [the] Lord. [[G2962]] 
18 “How [[G5101]] can I be sure of [[G1097]] this?” [[G3778]] Zechariah [[G2197]] asked [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] angel. [[G32]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] an old man, [[G4246]] and [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] wife [[G1135]] is well along [[G4260]] in [[G1722]] years.” [[G2250]] 
19 “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Gabriel,” [[G1043]] replied [[G611]] the [[G3588]] angel. [[G32]] “I stand [[G3936]] in the presence of [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] I have been sent [[G649]] to speak [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] to bring you this good news. [[G2097]] 
20 And [[G2532]] now [[G2400]] you will be [[G1510]] silent [[G4623]] and [[G2532]] unable [[G1410]] to speak [[G2980]] until [[G891]] the [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] [this] [[G3778]] comes to pass, [[G1096]] because [[G473]] you did not believe [[G4100]] my [[G1473]] words, [[G3056]] which [[G3748]] will be fulfilled [[G4137]] at [[G1519]] their [[G846]] proper time. [[G2540]] 
21 Meanwhile, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] were [[G1510]] waiting for [[G4328]] Zechariah [[G2197]] and [[G2532]] wondering [[G2296]] why [[G1722]] he [[G846]] took so long [[G5549]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G3485]] 
22 When [[G1161]] he came out [[G1831]] [and] was unable [[G1410]] to speak [[G2980]] to them, [[G846]] they realized [[G1921]] he had seen [[G3708]] a vision [[G3701]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G3485]] He [[G846]] kept [[G1510]] making signs [[G1269]] to them [[G846]] but [[G2532]] remained [[G1265]] speechless. [[G2974]] 
23 And [[G2532]] when [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of his [[G846]] service [[G3009]] were complete, [[G4130]] he returned [[G565]] home. [[G3624]] 
24 After [[G3326]] these [[G3778]] days, [[G2250]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] Elizabeth [[G1665]] became pregnant [[G4815]] and [[G2532]] for five [[G4002]] months [[G3376]] remained in seclusion. [[G4032]] She declared, [[G3004]] 
25 “The Lord [[G2962]] has done [[G4160]] [this] [[G3779]] for me. [[G1473]] In [[G1722]] [these] days [[G2250]] He has shown me favor [[G1896]] and taken away [[G851]] my [[G1473]] disgrace [[G3681]] among [[G1722]] the people.” [[G444]] 
26 In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sixth [[G1623]] month, [[G3376]] God [[G2316]] sent [[G649]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] Gabriel [[G1043]] to [[G1519]] a town [[G4172]] in Galilee [[G1056]] called [[G3686]] Nazareth, [[G3478]] 
27 to [[G4314]] a virgin [[G3933]] pledged in marriage [[G3423]] to a man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Joseph, [[G2501]] [who was] of [[G1537]] [the] house [[G3624]] of David. [[G1138]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] virgin’s [[G3933]] name [[G3686]] [was] Mary. [[G3137]] 
28 [The angel] appeared [[G1525]] to [[G4314]] her [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Greetings, [[G5463]] you who are highly favored! [[G5487]] The [[G3588]] Lord [is] [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] you.” [[G4771]] 
29 [Mary] was greatly troubled [[G1298]] at [[G1909]] [his] [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] wondered [[G1260]] what kind [[G4217]] of [[G3588]] greeting [[G783]] this [[G3778]] might be. [[G1510]] 
30 So [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] told [[G2036]] her, [[G846]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid, [[G5399]] Mary, [[G3137]] for [[G1063]] you have found [[G2147]] favor [[G5485]] with [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]] 
31 Behold, [[G2400]] you will conceive [[G4815]] and [[G2532]] give birth to [[G5088]] a son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] you shall give [[G2564]] Him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] Jesus. [[G2424]] 
32 He [[G3778]] will be [[G1510]] great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] will be called [[G2564]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of [the] Most High. [[G5310]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] will give [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of His [[G846]] father [[G3962]] David, [[G1138]] 
33 and [[G2532]] He will reign [[G936]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Jacob [[G2384]] forever. [[G165]] His [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] will [[G1510]] never [[G3756]] end!” [[G5056]] 
34 “How [[G4459]] can this be,” [[G1510]] Mary [[G3137]] asked [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] angel, [[G32]] “since [[G1893]] I am a virgin?” [[G1097]] 
35 The [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] replied, [[G611]] “[The] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] will come [[G1904]] upon [[G1909]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] [the] power [[G1411]] of [the] Most High [[G5310]] will overshadow [[G1982]] you. [[G4771]] So [[G1352]] the [[G3588]] Holy One [[G40]] to be born [[G1080]] will be called [[G2564]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]] 
36 Look, [[G2400]] even [[G2532]] Elizabeth [[G1665]] your [[G4771]] relative [[G4773]] has conceived [[G4815]] a son [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] old age, [[G1094]] and [[G2532]] she who [[G3588]] [was] called [[G2564]] barren [[G4723]] is [[G1510]] in her [[G846]] sixth [[G1623]] month. [[G3376]] 
37 For [[G3754]] nothing [[G4487]] will be impossible [[G101]] with [[G3844]] God.” [[G2316]] 
38 “[I am] [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] servant,” [[G1399]] Mary [[G3137]] answered. [[G2036]] “May it happen [[G1096]] to me [[G1473]] according to [[G2596]] your [[G4771]] word.” [[G4487]] Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] left [[G565]] her. [[G846]] 
39 In [[G1722]] those [[G3778]] days [[G2250]] Mary [[G3137]] got ready [[G450]] [and] hurried [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] a town [[G4172]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] hill country [[G3714]] of Judah, [[G2448]] 
40 [where] [[G2532]] she entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] home [[G3624]] of Zechariah [[G2197]] and [[G2532]] greeted [[G782]] Elizabeth. [[G1665]] 
41 When [[G1096]] Elizabeth [[G1665]] heard [[G191]] Mary’s [[G3137]] greeting, [[G783]] the [[G3588]] baby [[G1025]] leaped [[G4640]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] womb, [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] Elizabeth [[G1665]] was filled [[G4130]] with [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]] 
42 In a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G2906]] she exclaimed, [[G400]] “Blessed are [[G2127]] you [[G4771]] among [[G1722]] women, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] blessed is [[G2127]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] womb! [[G2836]] 
43 And [[G2532]] why [[G4159]] am I [[G1473]] so [honored], [[G3778]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] should come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me? [[G1473]] 
44 For [[G1063]] as soon [[G2400]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sound [[G5456]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] greeting [[G783]] reached [[G1096]] my [[G1473]] ears, [[G3775]] the [[G3588]] baby [[G1025]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] womb [[G2836]] leaped [[G4640]] for [[G1722]] joy. [[G20]] 
45 Blessed [is] [[G3107]] she who [[G3588]] has believed [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] [the] Lord’s [[G2962]] word [[G2980]] to her [[G846]] will be [[G1510]] fulfilled.” [[G5050]] 
46 Then [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] said: [[G2036]] “My [[G1473]] soul [[G5590]] magnifies [[G3170]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] 
47 and [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] spirit [[G4151]] rejoices [[G21]] in [[G1909]] God [[G2316]] my [[G1473]] Savior! [[G4990]] 
48 For [[G3754]] He has looked with favor [[G1914]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] humble state [[G5014]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] servant. [[G1399]] From [[G575]] now on [[G3568]] all [[G3956]] generations [[G1074]] will call me blessed. [[G3106]] 
49 For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Mighty One [[G1415]] has done [[G4160]] great things [[G3173]] for me. [[G1473]] Holy [is] [[G40]] His [[G846]] name. [[G3686]] 
50 His [[G846]] mercy [[G1656]] [extends] [[G1519]] to those [[G3588]] who fear [[G5399]] Him, [[G846]] from generation [[G1074]] to [[G2532]] generation. [[G1074]] 
51 He has performed [[G4160]] mighty deeds [[G2904]] with [[G1722]] His [[G846]] arm; [[G1023]] He has scattered [[G1287]] [those who are] proud [[G5244]] in [the] thoughts [[G1271]] of their [[G846]] hearts. [[G2588]] 
52 He has brought down [[G2507]] rulers [[G1413]] from [[G575]] [their] thrones, [[G2362]] [but] [[G2532]] has exalted [[G5312]] [the] humble. [[G5011]] 
53 He has filled [[G1705]] [the] hungry [[G3983]] with good things, [[G18]] [but] [[G2532]] has sent [[G1821]] [the] rich {away} [[G4147]] empty. [[G2756]] 
54 He has helped [[G482]] His [[G846]] servant [[G3816]] Israel, [[G2474]] remembering [[G3403]] to be merciful, [[G1656]] 
55 as [[G2531]] He promised [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] our [[G1473]] fathers, [[G3962]] to Abraham [[G11]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] descendants [[G4690]] forever.” [[G165]] 
56 Mary [[G3137]] stayed [[G3306]] with [[G4862]] [Elizabeth] [[G846]] for about [[G5613]] three [[G5140]] months [[G3376]] and then [[G2532]] returned [[G5290]] home. [[G3624]] 
57 When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] came [[G4130]] for [[G3588]] Elizabeth [[G1665]] to have her child, [[G5088]] she gave birth to [[G1080]] a son. [[G5207]] 
58 Her [[G846]] neighbors [[G4040]] and [[G2532]] relatives [[G4773]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] had shown her great [[G3170]] mercy, [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] they rejoiced with [[G4796]] her. [[G846]] 
59 On [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] eighth [[G3590]] day, [[G2250]] when [[G1096]] they came [[G2064]] to circumcise [[G4059]] the [[G3588]] child, [[G3813]] they were going to name [[G2564]] [him] [[G846]] after [[G1909]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Zechariah. [[G2197]] 
60 But [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] replied, [[G611]] “No! [[G3780]] He shall be called [[G2564]] John.” [[G2491]] 
61 They said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] her, [[G846]] “There is [[G1510]] no one [[G3762]] among [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] relatives [[G4772]] who [[G3739]] bears [[G2564]] this [[G3778]] name.” [[G3686]] 
62 [So] [[G1161]] they made signs [[G1770]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] [to inquire] [[G3588]] what [[G5101]] he wanted [[G2309]] to name [[G2564]] [the child]. [[G846]] 
63 [Zechariah] asked for [[G154]] a tablet [[G4093]] [and] wrote, [[G1125]] “His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] is [[G1510]] John.” [[G2491]] And [[G2532]] they were all astonished. [[G2296]] 
64 Immediately [[G3916]] [Zechariah’s] [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] was opened [[G455]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] tongue [was released], [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] he began to speak, [[G2980]] praising [[G2127]] God. [[G2316]] 
65 All [[G3956]] their [[G3588]] neighbors [[G4039]] were filled with [[G1096]] awe, [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] [people] throughout [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] hill country [[G3714]] of Judea [[G2449]] were talking about [[G1255]] these [[G3778]] events. [[G4487]] 
66 And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] who heard [this] [[G191]] wondered [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “What [[G5101]] then [[G686]] {will} this [[G3778]] child [[G3813]] become?” [[G1510]] For [[G1063]] the Lord’s [[G2962]] hand [[G5495]] was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]] 
67 Then [[G2532]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Zechariah [[G2197]] was filled [[G4130]] with [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] prophesied: [[G4395]] 
68 “Blessed be [[G2128]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Israel, [[G2474]] because [[G3754]] He has visited [[G1980]] and [[G2532]] redeemed [[G3085]] His [[G846]] people. [[G2992]] 
69 He has raised up [[G1453]] a horn [[G2768]] of salvation [[G4991]] for us [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] [the] house [[G3624]] of His [[G846]] servant [[G3816]] David, [[G1138]] 
70 as [[G2531]] He spoke [[G2980]] through [[G1223]] His [[G846]] holy [[G40]] prophets, [[G4396]] [those] of [[G575]] ages past, [[G165]] 
71 salvation [[G4991]] from [[G1537]] our [[G1473]] enemies [[G2190]] and [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] [the] hand [[G5495]] of all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] hate [[G3404]] us, [[G1473]] 
72 to show [[G4160]] mercy [[G1656]] to [[G3326]] our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] to remember [[G3403]] His [[G846]] holy [[G40]] covenant, [[G1242]] 
73 [the] oath [[G3727]] He swore [[G3660]] to [[G4314]] our [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] Abraham, [[G11]] to grant [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] 
74 deliverance [[G4506]] from [[G1537]] hostile [[G2190]] hands, [[G5495]] that we may serve [[G3000]] Him [[G846]] without fear, [[G870]] 
75 in [[G1722]] holiness [[G3742]] and [[G2532]] righteousness [[G1343]] before [[G1799]] Him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of our lives. [[G1473]] 
76 And [[G2532]] you, [[G4771]] child, [[G3813]] will be called [[G2564]] a prophet [[G4396]] of [the] Most High; [[G5310]] for [[G1063]] you will go on [[G4313]] before [[G1799]] the Lord [[G2962]] to prepare [[G2090]] His [[G846]] ways, [[G3598]] 
77 to give [[G1325]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] people [[G2992]] knowledge [[G1108]] of salvation [[G4991]] through [[G1722]] [the] forgiveness [[G859]] of their [[G846]] sins, [[G266]] 
78 because of [[G1223]] [the] tender [[G4698]] mercy [[G1656]] of our [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] by [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] [the] Dawn [[G395]] will visit [[G1980]] us [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] on high, [[G5311]] 
79 to shine on [[G2014]] those who [[G3588]] live [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] darkness [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] in [the] shadow [[G4639]] of death, [[G2288]] to guide [[G2720]] our [[G1473]] feet [[G4228]] into [[G1519]] [the] path [[G3598]] of peace.” [[G1515]] 
80 And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] child [[G3813]] grew [[G837]] and [[G2532]] became strong [[G2901]] in spirit; [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] he lived [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] until [[G2193]] [the] time [[G2250]] of his [[G846]] public appearance [[G323]] to [[G4314]] Israel.
