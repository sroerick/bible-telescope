# Luke 16
[[Luke 15|←]] • [[Luke 17|→]]
1 [Jesus] also said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] [His] [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] “There was [[G1510]] a [[G5100]] rich [[G4145]] man [[G444]] whose [[G3739]] manager [[G3623]] was accused of [[G1225]] wasting [[G1287]] his [[G846]] possessions. [[G5225]] 
2 So [[G2532]] he called [[G5455]] him in [[G846]] to ask, [[G2036]] ‘What [is] [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] I hear [[G191]] about [[G4012]] you? [[G4771]] Turn in [[G591]] an [[G3588]] account [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] management, [[G3622]] for [[G1063]] you cannot [[G1410]] be manager [[G3621]] any longer.’ [[G2089]] 
3 The [[G3588]] manager [[G3623]] said [[G2036]] to [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] ‘What [[G5101]] shall I do, [[G4160]] now that [[G3754]] my [[G1473]] master [[G2962]] is taking [[G851]] away [[G575]] my [[G1473]] [position]? [[G3622]] I am too weak [[G2480]] to dig [[G4626]] [and] too ashamed [[G153]] to beg. [[G1871]] 
4 I know [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] I will do, [[G4160]] so that [[G2443]] after [[G3752]] my removal [[G3179]] from [[G1537]] management, [[G3622]] [people] will welcome [[G1209]] me [[G1473]] into [[G1519]] their [[G1438]] homes...’ [[G3624]] 
5 And [[G2532]] he called in [[G4341]] each [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of his [[G1438]] master’s [[G2962]] debtors. [[G5533]] ‘How much [[G4214]] do you owe [[G3784]] my [[G1473]] master?’ [[G2962]] he asked [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]] 
6 ‘A hundred [[G1540]] [measures] [[G943]] of olive oil,’ [[G1637]] he answered. [[G2036]] ‘Take [[G1209]] your [[G4771]] bill,’ [[G1121]] said [the manager]. [[G2036]] ‘Sit down [[G2523]] quickly, [[G5030]] [and] write [[G1125]] fifty.’ [[G4004]] 
7 Then [[G1899]] he asked [[G2036]] another, [[G2087]] ‘And [[G1161]] how much [[G4214]] {do} you [[G4771]] owe?’ [[G3784]] ‘A hundred [[G1540]] [measures] [[G2884]] of wheat,’ [[G4621]] he replied. [[G2036]] ‘Take [[G1209]] your [[G4771]] bill [[G1121]] and [[G2532]] write [[G1125]] eighty,’ [[G3589]] he told [[G3004]] him. [[G846]] 
8 The [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] commended [[G1867]] the [[G3588]] dishonest [[G93]] manager [[G3623]] because [[G3754]] he had acted [[G4160]] shrewdly. [[G5430]] For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of this [[G3778]] age [[G165]] are [[G1510]] more shrewd [[G5429]] in dealing with [[G1519]] their own [[G1438]] kind [[G1074]] than [are] [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of light. [[G5457]] 
9 I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] use [[G1537]] worldly [[G93]] wealth [[G3126]] to make [[G4160]] friends [[G5384]] for yourselves, [[G1438]] so that [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] it is gone, [[G1587]] they will welcome [[G1209]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] dwellings. [[G4633]] 
10 Whoever [[G3588]] [is] faithful [[G4103]] with [[G1722]] very little [[G1646]] will [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] {be} faithful [[G4103]] with [[G1722]] much, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3588]] [is] dishonest [[G94]] with [[G1722]] very little [[G1646]] will [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] {be} dishonest [[G94]] with [[G1722]] much. [[G4183]] 
11 If, [[G1487]] then, [[G3767]] you have not been [[G1096]] faithful [[G4103]] with [[G1722]] worldly [[G94]] wealth, [[G3126]] who [[G5101]] will entrust [[G4100]] you [[G4771]] [with] [[G3588]] true [riches]? [[G228]] 
12 And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] you have not been [[G1096]] faithful [[G4103]] with [[G1722]] the [belongings] [[G3588]] of another, [[G245]] who [[G5101]] will give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] belongings [[G3588]] of your own? [[G5212]] 
13 No [[G3762]] servant [[G3610]] can [[G1410]] serve [[G1398]] two [[G1417]] masters. [[G2962]] Either [[G2228]] he will hate [[G3404]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] other, [[G2087]] or [[G2228]] he will be devoted to [[G472]] [the] one [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] despise [[G2706]] the [[G3588]] other. [[G2087]] You cannot [[G1410]] serve [[G1398]] [both] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] money. [[G3126]] 
14 The [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] who were [[G5225]] lovers of money, [[G5366]] heard [[G191]] all [[G3956]] [of this] [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] were scoffing at [[G1592]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
15 So [[G2532]] He said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [ones who] [[G3588]] justify [[G1344]] [yourselves] [[G1438]] before [[G1799]] men, [[G444]] but [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] knows [[G1097]] your [[G4771]] hearts. [[G2588]] For [[G3754]] what [[G3588]] [is] prized [[G5308]] among [[G1722]] men [[G444]] [is] detestable [[G946]] before [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]] 
16 The [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Prophets [were proclaimed] [[G4396]] until [[G3360]] John. [[G2491]] Since [[G575]] that time, [[G5119]] the {gospel} [[G3588]] of the kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is being preached, [[G2097]] and [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] is forcing his way [[G971]] into [[G1519]] it. [[G846]] 
17 But [[G1161]] it is [[G1510]] easier for [[G2123]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] to pass away [[G3928]] than for [[G2228]] a single [[G1520]] stroke of a pen [[G2762]] to drop out [[G4098]] of the [[G3588]] Law. [[G3551]] 
18 Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] divorces [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] marries [[G1060]] another [woman] [[G2087]] commits adultery, [[G3431]] and [[G2532]] he who [[G3588]] marries [[G1060]] a divorced woman [[G630]] commits adultery. [[G3431]] 
19 Now [[G1161]] there was [[G1510]] a [[G5100]] rich [[G4145]] man [[G444]] dressed in [[G1737]] purple [[G4209]] and [[G2532]] fine linen, [[G1040]] who lived each day in joyous [[G2165]] splendor. [[G2988]] 
20 And [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] beggar [[G4434]] named [[G3686]] Lazarus [[G2976]] lay [[G906]] at [[G4314]] his [[G846]] gate, [[G4440]] covered with sores [[G1669]] 
21 and [[G2532]] longing [[G1937]] to be fed [[G5526]] with [[G575]] the [[G3588]] crumbs that fell [[G4098]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] rich man’s [[G4145]] table. [[G5132]] Even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dogs [[G2965]] came [[G2064]] [and] licked [[G621]] his [[G846]] sores. [[G1668]] 
22 One day [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] beggar [[G4434]] died [[G599]] and [[G2532]] was carried [[G667]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] to [[G1519]] Abraham’s [[G11]] side. [[G2859]] And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] rich man [[G4145]] also [[G2532]] died [[G599]] and [[G2532]] was buried. [[G2290]] 
23 In [[G1722]] Hades, [[G86]] where he was [[G5225]] in [[G1722]] torment, [[G931]] he looked up [[G1869]] [and] saw [[G3708]] Abraham [[G11]] from [[G575]] afar, [[G3113]] with [[G2532]] Lazarus [[G2976]] by [[G1722]] his [[G846]] side. [[G2859]] 
24 So [[G2532]] he [[G846]] cried out, [[G5455]] ‘Father [[G3962]] Abraham, [[G11]] have mercy on [[G1653]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] send [[G3992]] Lazarus [[G2976]] to [[G2443]] dip [[G911]] the [[G3588]] tip [[G206]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] finger [[G1147]] in water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] cool [[G2711]] my [[G1473]] tongue. [[G1100]] For [[G3754]] I am in agony [[G3600]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] fire. [[G5395]] 
25 But [[G1161]] Abraham [[G11]] answered, [[G2036]] ‘Child, [[G5043]] remember [[G3403]] that [[G3754]] during [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] lifetime [[G2222]] you received [[G618]] your [[G4771]] good [[G18]] [things], [[G3588]] [while] [[G2532]] Lazarus [[G2976]] [received] [[G3668]] bad [things]. [[G2556]] But [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] he is comforted [[G3870]] here, [[G5602]] while [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] are left to suffer. [[G3600]] 
26 And [[G2532]] besides [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] this, [[G3778]] a great [[G3173]] chasm [[G5490]] has been fixed [[G4741]] between [[G3342]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] you, [[G4771]] so that [even] [[G3704]] those who [[G3588]] wish [[G2309]] cannot [[G1410]] cross [[G1224]] from here [[G1759]] to [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] nor [[G3366]] can [anyone] cross [[G1276]] from there [[G1564]] to [[G4314]] us. [[G1473]] 
27 ‘Then [[G3767]] I beg [[G2065]] you, [[G4771]] father,’ [[G3962]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘send [[G3992]] [Lazarus] [[G846]] to [[G1519]] my [[G1473]] father’s [[G3962]] house, [[G3624]] 
28 for [[G1063]] I have [[G2192]] five [[G4002]] brothers. [[G80]] Let him warn [[G1263]] them [[G846]] so [[G2443]] they [[G846]] will not also end up [[G2064]] in [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] place [[G5117]] of torment.’ [[G931]] 
29 But [[G1161]] Abraham [[G11]] replied, [[G3004]] ‘They have [[G2192]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets; [[G4396]] let [your brothers] listen to [[G191]] them.’ [[G846]] 
30 ‘No, [[G3780]] father [[G3962]] Abraham,’ [[G11]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘but [[G235]] if [[G1437]] someone [[G5100]] is sent [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] them [[G846]] from [[G575]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] they will repent.’ [[G3340]] 
31 Then [[G1161]] [Abraham] said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] ‘If [[G1487]] they do not listen to [[G191]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] they will not be persuaded even [[G3982]] if [[G1437]] someone [[G5100]] rises [[G450]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead.’” [[G3498]]
