1 Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] called [[G4779]] the [[G3588]] Twelve {together} [[G1427]] [and] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] demons, [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] [ power ] to cure [[G2323]] diseases. [[G3554]] 
2 And [[G2532]] He sent them out [[G649]] to proclaim [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] to heal [[G2390]] the [[G3588]] sick. [[G772]] 
3 “Take [[G142]] nothing [[G3367]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] journey,” [[G3598]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “no [[G3383]] staff, [[G4464]] no [[G3383]] bag, [[G4082]] no [[G3383]] bread, [[G740]] no [[G3383]] money, [[G694]] no [[G3383]] second [[G1417]] tunic. [[G5509]] 
4 Whatever [[G3739]] house [[G3614]] you enter, [[G1525]] stay [[G3306]] there [[G1563]] [until] [[G2532]] you leave [[G1831]] that area. [[G1564]] 
5 If anyone [[G3745]] does not welcome [[G1209]] you, [[G4771]] shake [[G660]] the [[G3588]] dust [[G2868]] off [[G575]] your [[G4771]] feet [[G4228]] when you leave [[G1831]] that [[G1565]] town, [[G4172]] as [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] against [[G1909]] them.” [[G846]] 
6 So [[G1161]] they set out [[G1831]] and went [[G1330]] from [[G2596]] village to village, [[G2968]] preaching the gospel [[G2097]] and [[G2532]] healing [people] [[G2323]] everywhere. [[G3837]] 
7 When [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] Tetrarch [[G5076]] heard about [[G191]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] was happening, [[G1096]] he was perplexed. [[G1280]] For [[G1223]] some [[G5100]] were saying [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] John [[G2491]] had risen [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] 
8 others [[G5100]] that [[G3754]] Elijah [[G2243]] had appeared, [[G5316]] and still [[G1161]] others [[G243]] that [[G3754]] a [[G5100]] prophet [[G4396]] of [[G3588]] old [[G744]] had arisen. [[G450]] 
9 “I [[G1473]] beheaded [[G607]] John,” [[G2491]] Herod [[G2264]] said, [[G2036]] “but [[G1161]] who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] this [man] [[G3778]] I hear [[G191]] such things [[G5108]] about?” [[G4012]] And [[G2532]] he kept trying [[G2212]] to see [[G3708]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
10 Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] returned [[G5290]] [and] reported [[G1334]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] all that [[G3745]] they had done. [[G4160]] Taking [[G3880]] them {away} [[G846]] privately, [[G2398]] He withdrew [[G5298]] to [[G1519]] a town [[G4172]] called [[G2564]] Bethsaida. [[G966]] 
11 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] found out [[G1097]] [and] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]] He welcomed [[G588]] them [[G846]] [and] spoke [[G2980]] to them [[G846]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] He healed [[G2390]] those who [[G3588]] needed [[G5532]] healing. [[G2322]] 
12 As [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] neared its end, [[G2827]] the [[G3588]] Twelve [[G1427]] came [[G4334]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Dismiss [[G630]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] so [[G2443]] they can go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] surrounding [[G2945]] villages [[G2968]] and [[G2532]] countryside [[G68]] for lodging [[G2647]] and [[G2532]] provisions. [[G1979]] For [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] a desolate [[G2048]] place [[G5117]] here. [[G5602]] 
13 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] give [[G1325]] them [[G846]] something to eat.” [[G5315]] “We have only [[G1473]] five [[G4002]] loaves of bread [[G740]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] fish,” [[G2486]] they answered, [[G2036]] “unless [[G1487]] we [[G1473]] go [[G4198]] [and] buy [[G59]] food [[G1033]] for [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] these [[G3778]] people.” [[G2992]] 
14 ( [[G1063]] There were [[G1510]] about [[G5616]] five thousand [[G4000]] men.) [[G435]] He told [[G2036]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “Have them sit down [[G2625]] in [[G303]] groups [[G2828]] of about [[G5616]] fifty {each}.” [[G4004]] 
15 They did [[G4160]] so, [[G3779]] and [[G2532]] everyone [[G537]] was seated. [[G2625]] 
16 Taking [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] fish [[G2486]] [and] looking up [[G308]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] [Jesus] spoke a blessing [[G2127]] and [[G2532]] broke [[G2622]] them. [[G846]] Then [[G2532]] He gave [them] [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] to set before [[G3908]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G3793]] 
17 They all ate [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were satisfied, [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] [the disciples] [[G846]] picked up [[G142]] twelve [[G1427]] basketfuls [[G2894]] of broken pieces [[G2801]] that were left over. [[G4052]] 
18 [One day] [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was [[G1510]] praying [[G4336]] in [[G2596]] private [[G3441]] [and] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] were with [[G4895]] Him, [[G846]] He questioned [[G1905]] them: [[G846]] “Who [[G5101]] {do} the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] say [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am? [[G1510]] 
19 “[Some say] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist,” [[G910]] they answered, [[G611]] “others [say] [[G243]] Elijah, [[G2243]] and still [[G1161]] others [[G243]] that [[G3754]] a prophet [[G4396]] of [[G3588]] old [[G744]] has arisen.” [[G450]] 
20 “But [[G1161]] who [[G5101]] {do} you [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am?” [[G1510]] He asked. [[G2036]] Peter [[G4074]] replied, [[G611]] “The [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] of God.” [[G2316]] 
21 [Jesus] strictly warned [[G2008]] them [[G846]] {not} to tell [[G3004]] this [[G3778]] to [anyone]. [[G3367]] 
22 “The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] must [[G1163]] suffer [[G3958]] many things,” [[G4183]] He said. [[G2036]] “He must be rejected [[G593]] by [[G575]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] chief priests, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] He must be killed [[G615]] and [[G2532]] on the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] be raised to life.” [[G1453]] 
23 Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] all of them, [[G3956]] “If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] would [[G2309]] come [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] Me, [[G1473]] he must deny [[G720]] himself [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] his [[G846]] cross [[G4716]] daily [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G190]] Me. [[G1473]] 
24 For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3739]] wants [[G2309]] to save [[G4982]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] will lose [[G622]] it, [[G846]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3739]] loses [[G622]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for My sake [[G1752]] will save [[G4982]] it. [[G846]] 
25 What [[G5101]] will it profit [[G5623]] a man [[G444]] if he gains [[G2770]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G2889]] yet [[G1161]] loses [[G622]] or [[G2228]] forfeits [[G2210]] his very self? [[G1438]] 
26 If anyone [[G3739]] is ashamed of [[G1870]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1699]] words, [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be ashamed of [[G1870]] him [[G3778]] when [[G3752]] He comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] [in the glory] of the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] angels. [[G32]] 
27 But [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] truthfully, [[G230]] some [[G5100]] who [[G3588]] are [[G1510]] standing [[G2476]] here [[G847]] will not taste [[G1089]] death [[G2288]] until [[G2193]] they see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God.” [[G2316]] 
28 About [[G5616]] eight [[G3638]] days [[G2250]] after [[G3326]] [Jesus] had said [[G3056]] these things, [[G3778]] He took [[G3880]] Peter, [[G4074]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] James, [[G2385]] [and] went up [[G305]] on [[G1519]] a mountain [[G3735]] to pray. [[G4336]] 
29 And [[G2532]] as [[G1096]] He [[G846]] was praying, [[G4336]] the [[G3588]] appearance [[G1491]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] face [[G4383]] changed, [[G2087]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] clothes [[G2441]] became radiantly [[G1823]] white. [[G3022]] 
30 Suddenly [[G2400]] two [[G1417]] men, [[G435]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] Elijah, [[G2243]] began talking with [[G4814]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] 
31 [They] [[G3739]] appeared [[G3708]] in [[G1722]] glory [[G1391]] [and] spoke about [[G2036]] His [[G846]] departure, [[G1841]] which [[G3739]] He was about [[G3195]] to accomplish [[G4137]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] 
32 Meanwhile [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] his companions [[G3588]] were [[G1510]] overcome [[G916]] by sleep, [[G5258]] but [[G1161]] when they awoke, [[G1235]] they saw [[G3708]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] men [[G435]] standing with [[G4921]] Him. [[G846]] 
33 As [[G2532]] [Moses and Elijah] [[G846]] were leaving, [[G1316]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] “Master, [[G1988]] it is [[G1510]] good [[G2570]] for us [[G1473]] to be [[G1510]] here. [[G5602]] Let us put up [[G4160]] three [[G5140]] shelters: [[G4633]] one [[G1520]] for You, [[G4771]] one [[G1520]] for Moses, [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] for Elijah. [[G2243]] ( [[G3361]] He did not know [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] he was saying.) [[G3004]] 
34 While [[G1161]] [Peter] [[G846]] was speaking, [[G3004]] a cloud [[G3507]] appeared [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] enveloped [[G1982]] them, [[G846]] and [[G1161]] they were afraid [[G5399]] as [[G1722]] they [[G846]] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] cloud. [[G3507]] 
35 And [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] came [[G1096]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] cloud, [[G3507]] saying, [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] Son, [[G5207]] whom I have chosen; [[G1586]] listen to [[G191]] Him!” [[G846]] 
36 After [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] had spoken, [[G1096]] only [[G3441]] Jesus [[G2424]] was present [with them]. [[G2147]] [The disciples] [[G846]] kept this to themselves, [[G4601]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] they did not tell anyone [[G518]] what [[G3739]] they had seen. [[G3708]] 
37 The [[G3588]] next [[G1836]] day, [[G2250]] when [[G846]] they came down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was met [[G4876]] by a large [[G4183]] crowd. [[G3793]] 
38 Suddenly [[G2532]] a man [[G435]] in [[G575]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] cried out, [[G994]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] I beg [[G1189]] You [[G4771]] to look [[G1914]] at [[G1909]] my [[G1473]] son, [[G5207]] for [[G3754]] he is [[G1510]] my [[G1473]] only child. [[G3439]] 
39 A spirit [[G4151]] keeps seizing [[G2983]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he screams [[G2896]] abruptly. [[G1810]] It throws him into convulsions [[G4682]] [so that] [[G3326]] he foams at the mouth. [[G876]] It keeps mauling [[G4937]] him [[G846]] [and] rarely [[G3425]] departs [[G672]] from [[G575]] him. [[G846]] 
40 I begged [[G1189]] Your [[G4771]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G2443]] drive it out, [[G1544]] but [[G2532]] they were unable.” [[G1410]] 
41 “O [[G5599]] unbelieving [[G571]] and [[G2532]] perverse [[G1294]] generation,” [[G1074]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “How long [[G2193]] must I remain [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] put up with [[G430]] you? [[G4771]] Bring [[G4317]] your [[G4771]] son [[G5207]] here.” [[G5602]] 
42 Even [[G1161]] while [[G2089]] [the boy] [[G846]] was approaching, [[G4334]] the [[G3588]] demon [[G1140]] slammed him to the ground [[G4486]] in a convulsion. [[G4952]] But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit, [[G4151]] healed [[G2390]] the [[G3588]] boy, [[G3816]] and [[G2532]] gave him back [[G591]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] father. [[G3962]] 
43 And [[G1161]] they were all astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] greatness [[G3168]] of God. [[G2316]] While [[G1161]] everyone [[G3956]] was marveling [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] [Jesus] was doing, [[G4160]] He said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] 
44 “{Let} [[G4771]] these [[G3778]] words [[G3056]] sink [[G5087]] into [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] ears: [[G3775]] The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] is about [[G3195]] to be delivered [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] [the] hands [[G5495]] of men.” [[G444]] 
45 But [[G1161]] they did not understand [[G50]] this [[G3778]] statement. [[G4487]] It was [[G1510]] veiled [[G3871]] from [[G575]] them [[G846]] so that [[G2443]] they could not comprehend [[G143]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they were afraid [[G5399]] to ask [[G2065]] Him [[G846]] about [[G4012]] [it]. [[G4487]] 
46 Then [[G1161]] an argument [[G1261]] started [[G1525]] among [[G1722]] [the disciples] [[G846]] [as to] [[G3588]] which [[G5101]] of them [[G846]] would be [[G1510]] [the] greatest. [[G3173]] 
47 But [[G1161]] Jesus, [[G2424]] knowing [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] thoughts [[G1261]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] had [[G2476]] a little child {stand} [[G3813]] beside [[G3844]] Him. [[G1438]] 
48 And [[G2532]] He said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Whoever [[G3739]] welcomes [[G1209]] this [[G3778]] little child [[G3813]] in [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] name [[G3686]] welcomes [[G1209]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3739]] welcomes [[G1209]] Me [[G1473]] welcomes [[G1209]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G649]] Me. [[G1473]] For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3588]] is [[G5225]] [the] least [[G3398]] among [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] of you, [[G4771]] he [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] [the] greatest. [[G3173]] 
49 “Master,” [[G1988]] said [[G611]] John, [[G2491]] “we saw [[G3708]] someone [[G5100]] driving out [[G1544]] demons [[G1140]] in [[G1722]] Your [[G4771]] name, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] we tried to stop [[G2967]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] he does not accompany [[G190]] us.” [[G1473]] 
50 “[Do} not [[G3361]] stop [him],” [[G2967]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G2036]] “for [[G1063]] whoever [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] against [[G2596]] you [[G4771]] is [[G1510]] for [[G5228]] you.” [[G4771]] 
51 As [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] ascension [[G354]] approached, [[G4845]] [Jesus] [[G846]] resolutely set out [[G4741]] for [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] 
52 He sent [[G649]] messengers [[G32]] on ahead, [[G4253]] [who] [[G2532]] went [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] a village [[G2968]] of the Samaritans [[G4541]] to [[G5613]] make arrangements [[G2090]] for Him. [[G846]] 
53 But [[G2532]] [the people there] refused to welcome [[G1209]] Him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] He [[G846]] was [[G1510]] heading [[G4198]] for [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] 
54 When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] saw [this], [[G3708]] they asked, [[G2036]] “Lord, [[G2962]] do You want [[G2309]] us to call [[G2036]] down [[G2597]] fire [[G4442]] from [[G575]] heaven [[G3772]] to consume [[G355]] them?” [[G846]] 
55 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] turned [[G4762]] [and] rebuked [[G2008]] them, [[G846]] 
56 and [[G2532]] they went on [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] another [[G2087]] village. [[G2968]] 
57 As they [[G846]] were walking [[G4198]] along [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] road, [[G3598]] someone [[G5100]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus], [[G846]] “I will follow [[G190]] You [[G4771]] wherever [[G3699]] You go.” [[G565]] 
58 Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G2036]] “Foxes [[G258]] have [[G2192]] dens [[G5454]] and [[G2532]] birds [[G4071]] of the [[G3588]] air [[G3772]] [have] nests, [[G2682]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] has [[G2192]] no place [[G3756]] to lay [[G2827]] [His] [[G3588]] head.” [[G2776]] 
59 Then [[G1161]] He said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] another [man], [[G2087]] “Follow [[G190]] Me.” [[G1473]] “Lord,” [[G2962]] [the man] replied, [[G2036]] “first [[G4412]] let [[G2010]] me [[G1473]] go [[G565]] [and] bury [[G2290]] my [[G1473]] father.” [[G3962]] 
60 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “Let [[G863]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] bury [[G2290]] their own [[G1438]] dead. [[G3498]] You, [[G4771]] however, [[G1161]] go [[G565]] [and] proclaim [[G1229]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God.” [[G2316]] 
61 Still [[G1161]] another [[G2087]] said, [[G2036]] “I will follow [[G190]] You, [[G4771]] Lord; [[G2962]] but [[G1161]] first [[G4412]] let [[G2010]] me [[G1473]] bid farewell [[G657]] to [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] family.” [[G3624]] 
62 Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared, [[G2036]] “No one [[G3762]] who puts [[G1911]] [his] [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] to [[G1909]] [the] plow [[G723]] and then [[G2532]] looks [[G991]] back [[G3694]] is [[G1510]] fit [[G2111]] for the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God.” [[G2316]]
