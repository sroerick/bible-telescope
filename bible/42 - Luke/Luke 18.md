# Luke 18
[[Luke 17|←]] • [[Luke 19|→]]
1 Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] a parable [[G3850]] about [[G4314]] their [[G846]] need [[G1163]] to pray [[G4336]] at all times [[G3842]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] lose heart: [[G1573]] 
2 “In [[G1722]] a certain [[G5100]] town [[G4172]] there was [[G1510]] a [[G5100]] judge [[G2923]] [who] neither [[G3361]] feared [[G5399]] God [[G2316]] [nor] [[G3361]] respected [[G1788]] men. [[G444]] 
3 And [[G1161]] there was [[G1510]] a widow [[G5503]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] town [[G4172]] who kept appealing [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] ‘Give me justice [[G1556]] [against] [[G575]] my [[G1473]] adversary.’ [[G476]] 
4 For [[G1909]] a while [[G5550]] he refused, [[G2309]] but [[G1161]] later [[G3326]] he [[G3778]] said [[G2036]] to [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] ‘Even [[G2532]] though [[G1487]] I do not fear [[G5399]] God [[G2316]] [or] [[G3761]] respect [[G1788]] men, [[G444]] 
5 yet [[G1065]] because [[G1223]] this [[G3778]] widow [[G5503]] keeps pestering me, [[G3930]] I will give her justice. [[G1556]] [Then] [[G2443]] she will stop wearing me out [[G5299]] with her perpetual requests.’” [[G1519]] 
6 And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said, [[G2036]] “Listen to [[G191]] [the] words [[G3004]] of the [[G3588]] unjust [[G93]] judge. [[G2923]] 
7 {Will} not [[G3756]] God [[G2316]] bring about [[G4160]] justice for [[G1557]] His [[G846]] elect [[G1588]] who [[G3588]] cry out [[G994]] to Him [[G846]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night? [[G3571]] Will He continue to defer [[G3114]] their help? [[G1909]] 
8 I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] He will promptly carry out [[G4160]] justice [[G1557]] on their behalf. [[G846]] Nevertheless, [[G4133]] [when] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] comes, [[G2064]] will He find [[G2147]] faith [[G4102]] on [[G1909]] earth?” [[G1093]] 
9 To [[G4314]] some [[G5100]] who [[G3588]] trusted [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] their own [[G1438]] righteousness [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] viewed [[G1848]] others {with contempt}, [[G3062]] He also told [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] parable: [[G3850]] 
10 “Two [[G1417]] men [[G444]] went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] to pray. [[G4336]] One [was] [[G1520]] a Pharisee [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] a tax collector. [[G5057]] 
11 The [[G3588]] Pharisee [[G5330]] stood [[G2476]] by [[G4314]] himself [[G1438]] [and] prayed, [[G4336]] ‘God, [[G2316]] I thank [[G2168]] You [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] like [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] men— [[G444]] swindlers, [[G727]] evildoers, [[G94]] adulterers— [[G3432]] or [[G2228]] even [[G2532]] like [[G5613]] this [[G3778]] tax collector. [[G5057]] 
12 I fast [[G3522]] twice [[G1364]] a [[G3588]] week [[G4521]] [and] pay tithes [[G586]] of all that [[G3956]] I receive.’ [[G2932]] 
13 But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] tax collector [[G5057]] stood [[G2476]] at a distance, [[G3113]] unwilling even [[G2309]] to lift up [[G1869]] [his] [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] to [[G1519]] heaven. [[G3772]] Instead, [[G235]] he beat [[G5180]] his [[G846]] breast [[G4738]] [and] said, [[G3004]] ‘God, [[G2316]] have mercy [[G2433]] on me, [[G1473]] a [[G3588]] sinner! [[G268]] 
14 I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] this [man], [[G3778]] rather than [[G3844]] [the Pharisee], [[G1565]] went home [[G2597]] justified. [[G1344]] For [[G3754]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] exalts [[G5312]] himself [[G1438]] will be humbled, [[G5013]] but [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] humbles [[G5013]] himself [[G1438]] will be exalted.” [[G5312]] 
15 Now [[G1161]] [people] were even bringing [[G4374]] [their] [[G3588]] babies [[G1025]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] for [[G2443]] Him to place His hands [[G680]] on them. [[G846]] And when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] saw [this], [[G3708]] they rebuked [[G2008]] them. [[G846]] 
16 But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] called [the children] to [Him] [[G4341]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Let [[G863]] the [[G3588]] little children [[G3813]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] hinder [[G2967]] them! [[G846]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] belongs [[G1510]] to [[G3588]] such as these. [[G5108]] 
17 Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] if [[G302]] anyone [[G3739]] does not receive [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] like [[G5613]] a little child, [[G3813]] he will never enter [[G1525]] it.” [[G846]] 
18 Then [[G2532]] a certain [[G5100]] ruler [[G758]] asked [[G1905]] Him, [[G846]] “Good [[G18]] Teacher, [[G1320]] what [[G5101]] must I do [[G4160]] to inherit [[G2816]] eternal [[G166]] life?” [[G2222]] 
19 “Why [[G5101]] do you call [[G3004]] Me [[G1473]] good?” [[G18]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G2036]] “No one [is] [[G3762]] good [[G18]] except [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] alone. [[G1520]] 
20 You know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] commandments: [[G1785]] ‘Do not commit adultery, [[G3431]] do not murder, [[G5407]] do not steal, [[G2813]] do not bear false witness, [[G5576]] honor [[G5091]] your [[G4771]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother.’” [[G3384]] 
21 “All [[G3956]] these [[G3778]] have I kept [[G5442]] from [[G1537]] my [[G1473]] youth,” [[G3503]] he said. [[G2036]] 
22 On [[G1161]] hearing this, [[G191]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] still [[G2089]] lack [[G3007]] one thing: [[G1520]] Sell [[G4453]] everything [[G3956]] you own [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1239]] to [the] poor, [[G4434]] and [[G2532]] you will have [[G2192]] treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] Then [[G2532]] come, [[G1204]] follow [[G190]] Me. [[G1473]] 
23 But [[G1161]] when [the ruler] heard [[G191]] this, [[G3778]] he became [[G1096]] very sad, [[G4036]] because [[G1063]] he was [[G1510]] extremely [[G4970]] wealthy. [[G4145]] 
24 Seeing [[G3708]] [the man’s] [[G846]] sorrow, [[G4036]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “How [[G4459]] hard [it is] [[G1423]] for the [[G3588]] rich [[G5536]] to enter [[G1531]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]] 
25 Indeed, [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] easier for [[G2123]] a camel [[G2574]] to pass [[G1525]] through [[G1223]] an eye [[G5169]] of a needle [[G956]] than for [[G2228]] a rich man [[G4145]] to enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God.” [[G2316]] 
26 Those who [[G3588]] heard [this] [[G191]] asked, [[G2036]] “Who [[G5101]] then [[G2532]] can [[G1410]] be saved?” [[G4982]] 
27 But [[G1161]] [Jesus] said, [[G2036]] “What [is] [[G3588]] impossible [[G102]] with [[G3844]] man [[G444]] is [[G1510]] possible [[G1415]] with [[G3844]] God.” [[G2316]] 
28 “Look,” [[G2400]] said [[G2036]] Peter, [[G4074]] “we [[G1473]] have left [[G863]] everything we had [[G2398]] to follow [[G190]] You.” [[G4771]] 
29 “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you,” [[G4771]] [Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “no one [[G3762]] who [[G3739]] has left [[G863]] home [[G3614]] or [[G2228]] wife [[G1135]] or [[G2228]] brothers [[G80]] or [[G2228]] parents [[G1118]] or [[G2228]] children [[G5043]] for the sake of [[G1752]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] 
30 will fail to receive [[G618]] many times more [[G4179]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3778]] proper time— [[G2540]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] age [[G165]] to come, [[G2064]] eternal [[G166]] life.” [[G2222]] 
31 Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] Twelve {aside} [[G1427]] [and] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “Look, [[G2400]] we are going up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] everything [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] have written [[G1125]] about the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be fulfilled. [[G5055]] 
32 He will be handed over [[G3860]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] will be mocked [[G1702]] and [[G2532]] insulted [[G5195]] and [[G2532]] spit upon. [[G1716]] 
33 They will flog [Him] [[G3146]] [and] kill [[G615]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] on the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] He will rise again.” [[G450]] 
34 But [[G2532]] [the disciples] [[G846]] did not understand any [[G4920]] of these things. [[G3778]] The [[G3588]] meaning [[G4487]] was [[G1510]] hidden [[G2928]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they did not comprehend [[G1097]] what [[G3588]] He was saying. [[G3004]] 
35 As [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] drew near [[G1448]] to [[G1519]] Jericho, [[G2410]] a [[G5100]] blind [man] [[G5185]] was sitting [[G2521]] beside [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] road, [[G3598]] begging. [[G1871]] 
36 When [[G1161]] he heard [[G191]] the crowd [[G3793]] going by, [[G1279]] he asked [[G4441]] what [[G5101]] was [[G1510]] [happening]. [[G3778]] 
37 “Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth [[G3480]] is passing by,” [[G3928]] they told [[G518]] him. [[G846]] 
38 [So] [[G2532]] he called out, [[G994]] “Jesus, [[G2424]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] me!” [[G1473]] 
39 Those who [[G3588]] led the way [[G4254]] admonished [[G2008]] him [[G846]] to be silent, [[G4601]] but [[G1161]] he cried out [[G2896]] all the [[G4183]] louder, [[G3123]] “Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] me.” [[G1473]] 
40 Jesus [[G2424]] stopped [[G2476]] [and] directed that [[G2753]] [the man] [[G846]] be brought [[G71]] to [[G4314]] Him. [[G846]] When [[G1161]] he [[G846]] had been brought near, [[G1448]] [Jesus] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] 
41 “What [[G5101]] do you want [[G2309]] Me to do [[G4160]] for you?” [[G4771]] “Lord,” [[G2962]] he said, [[G2036]] “let me see again.” [[G308]] 
42 “Receive your sight!” [[G308]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G2036]] “Your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] has healed [[G4982]] you.” [[G4771]] 
43 Immediately [[G3916]] he received his sight [[G308]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] [Jesus], [[G846]] glorifying [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]] And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] [who] saw [this] [[G3708]] gave [[G1325]] praise [[G136]] to God. [[G2316]]
