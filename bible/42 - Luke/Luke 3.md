1 In [[G1722]] [the] fifteenth [[G4003]] year [[G2094]] of the [[G3588]] reign [[G2231]] of Tiberius [[G5086]] Caesar, [[G2541]] [while] Pontius [[G4194]] Pilate [[G4091]] was governor [[G2230]] of Judea, [[G2449]] Herod [[G2264]] tetrarch [[G5075]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Philip [[G5376]] tetrarch [[G5075]] of Ituraea [[G2484]] and [[G2532]] Trachonitis, [[G5139]] and [[G2532]] Lysanias [[G3078]] tetrarch [[G5075]] of Abilene, [[G9]] 
2 during [[G1909]] [the] high priesthood [[G749]] of Annas [[G452]] and [[G2532]] Caiaphas, [[G2533]] [the] word [[G4487]] of God [[G2316]] came [[G1096]] to [[G1909]] John [[G2491]] son [[G5207]] of Zechariah [[G2197]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]] 
3 He went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] region around [[G4066]] the [[G3588]] Jordan, [[G2446]] proclaiming [[G2784]] a baptism [[G908]] of repentance [[G3341]] for [[G1519]] [the] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins, [[G266]] 
4 as [[G5613]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] [the] book [[G976]] of [the] words [[G3056]] of Isaiah [[G2268]] [the] prophet: [[G4396]] “[A] voice [[G5456]] of one calling [[G994]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] ‘Prepare [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] for [the] Lord; [[G2962]] make [[G4160]] straight [[G2117]] paths [[G5147]] for Him. [[G846]] 
5 Every [[G3956]] valley [[G5327]] shall be filled in, [[G4137]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] mountain [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] hill [[G1015]] made low. [[G5013]] The [[G3588]] crooked [ways] [[G4646]] shall be made [[G1510]] straight, [[G2117]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rough [[G5138]] ways [[G3598]] smooth. [[G3006]] 
6 And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] mankind [[G4561]] will see [[G3708]] God’s [[G2316]] salvation.” [[G4992]] 
7 Then [[G3767]] [John] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] coming out [[G1607]] to be baptized [[G907]] by [[G5259]] him, [[G846]] “You brood [[G1081]] of vipers, [[G2191]] who [[G5101]] warned [[G5263]] you [[G4771]] to flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3195]] wrath? [[G3709]] 
8 Therefore [[G3767]] produce [[G4160]] fruit [[G2590]] worthy [[G514]] of repentance. [[G3341]] And [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] begin [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] to [[G1722]] yourselves, [[G1438]] ‘We have [[G2192]] Abraham [[G11]] [as our] father.’ [[G3962]] For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] out of [[G1537]] these [[G3778]] stones [[G3037]] God [[G2316]] can [[G1410]] raise up [[G1453]] children [[G5043]] for Abraham. [[G11]] 
9 The [[G3588]] ax [[G513]] lies ready [[G2749]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] root [[G4491]] of the [[G3588]] trees, [[G1186]] and [[G3767]] every [[G3956]] tree [[G1186]] that does not produce [[G4160]] good [[G2570]] fruit [[G2590]] will be cut down [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] [the] fire.” [[G4442]] 
10 The [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] “What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] should we do?” [[G4160]] 
11 [John] replied, [[G611]] “Whoever [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] tunics [[G5509]] should share with [[G3330]] him [[G3588]] who has [[G2192]] none, [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] food [[G1033]] should do [[G4160]] the same.” [[G3668]] 
12 Even [[G2532]] tax collectors [[G5057]] came [[G2064]] to be baptized. [[G907]] “Teacher,” [[G1320]] they asked, [[G2036]] “what [[G5101]] should we do?” [[G4160]] 
13 “Collect [[G4238]] no [[G3367]] more than [[G4119]] you [[G4771]] are authorized,” [[G1299]] he answered. [[G2036]] 
14 Then [[G1161]] [some] soldiers [[G4754]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] “And [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] should we do?” [[G4160]] “Do not take money by force [[G1286]] or [[G3366]] false accusation,” [[G4811]] he said. [[G2036]] “Be content with [[G714]] your [[G4771]] wages.” [[G3800]] 
15 The [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] were waiting expectantly [[G4328]] and [[G2532]] {were} all [[G3956]] wondering [[G1260]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] if [[G3361]] John [[G2491]] could be [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
16 John [[G2491]] answered [[G611]] all of them: [[G3956]] “I [[G1473]] baptize [[G907]] you [[G4771]] with water, [[G5204]] but [[G1161]] [One] [[G3588]] more powerful [[G2478]] than I [[G1473]] will come, [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] straps [[G2438]] of [[G3588]] whose [[G3739]] sandals [[G5266]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] to untie. [[G3089]] He [[G846]] will baptize [[G907]] you [[G4771]] with [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] with fire. [[G4442]] 
17 [His] [[G3739]] winnowing fork [is] [[G4425]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] to clear [[G1245]] His [[G846]] threshing floor [[G257]] and [[G2532]] to gather [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] wheat [[G4621]] into [[G1519]] His [[G846]] barn. [[G596]] But [[G1161]] He will burn up [[G2618]] the [[G3588]] chaff [[G892]] with unquenchable [[G762]] fire. [[G4442]] 
18 [With these and] [[G3303]] many [[G4183]] other [[G2087]] exhortations, [[G3870]] [John] proclaimed the good news to [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]] 
19 But [[G1161]] when he rebuked [[G1651]] Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] tetrarch [[G5076]] regarding [[G4012]] his [[G846]] brother’s [[G80]] wife [[G1135]] Herodias [[G2266]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] [the] evils [[G4190]] [he] [[G2264]] had done, [[G4160]] 
20 [Herod] added [[G4369]] this [[G3778]] to [[G1909]] them all: [[G3956]] He locked [[G2623]] John {up} [[G2491]] in [[G1722]] prison. [[G5438]] 
21 When [[G1161]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] were being baptized, [[G907]] Jesus [[G2424]] was baptized [[G907]] too. [[G2532]] And [[G2532]] as He was praying, [[G4336]] heaven [[G3772]] was opened, [[G455]] 
22 and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] descended [[G2597]] on [[G1909]] Him [[G846]] in a bodily [[G4984]] form [[G1491]] like [[G5613]] a dove. [[G4058]] And [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] came [[G1096]] from [[G1537]] heaven: [[G3772]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] Son; [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] You [[G4771]] I am well pleased. [[G2106]] 
23 Jesus [[G2424]] Himself [[G846]] was [[G1510]] about [[G5616]] thirty [[G5144]] years [old] [[G2094]] when He began [His ministry]. [[G756]] He was [[G1510]] known [[G3543]] as [[G5613]] [the] son [[G5207]] of Joseph, [[G2501]] the [son] [[G3588]] of Heli, [[G2242]]
