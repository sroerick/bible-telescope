1 Now [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] a decree [[G1378]] went out [[G1831]] from [[G3844]] Caesar [[G2541]] Augustus [[G828]] that a census should be taken [[G583]] of the [[G3588]] entire [[G3956]] [ Roman ] world. [[G3625]] 
2 This [was the] [[G3778]] first [[G4413]] census [[G582]] to take place [while] [[G1096]] Quirinius [[G2958]] was governor [[G2230]] of [[G3588]] Syria. [[G4947]] 
3 And [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] his own [[G1438]] town [[G4172]] to register. [[G583]] 
4 [So] [[G1161]] Joseph [[G2501]] also [[G2532]] went up [[G305]] from [[G575]] Nazareth [[G3478]] in Galilee [[G1056]] to [[G1519]] Judea, [[G2449]] to [[G1519]] [the] City [[G4172]] of David [[G1138]] called [[G2564]] Bethlehem, [[G965]] since [[G1223]] he [[G846]] was [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] [the] house [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] line [[G3965]] of David. [[G1138]] 
5 [He went there] to register [[G583]] with [[G4862]] Mary, [[G3137]] who was [[G3588]] pledged to him in marriage [[G3423]] [and] was expecting [[G1510]] a child. [[G1471]] 
6 While [[G1096]] they were [[G1510]] there, [[G1563]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2250]] came [[G4130]] for [[G3588]] her [[G846]] Child to be born. [[G5088]] 
7 And [[G2532]] she gave birth to [[G5088]] her [[G846]] firstborn, [[G4416]] a Son. [[G5207]] She wrapped Him in swaddling cloths [[G4683]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G347]] Him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a manger, [[G5336]] because [[G1360]] there was [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] room [[G5117]] for them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] inn. [[G2646]] 
8 And [[G2532]] there were [[G1510]] shepherds [[G4166]] residing in the fields [[G63]] nearby, [[G5561]] keeping [[G5442]] watch [[G5438]] over [[G1909]] their [[G846]] flocks [[G4167]] by night. [[G3571]] 
9 Just then, [[G2532]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] stood before [[G2186]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [the] glory [[G1391]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] shone around [[G4034]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they were terrified. [[G5399]] 
10 But [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid! [[G5399]] For [[G1063]] behold, [[G2400]] I bring you good news [[G2097]] [of] great [[G3173]] joy [[G5479]] that [[G3748]] will be [[G1510]] for all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people: [[G2992]] 
11 Today [[G4594]] in [[G1722]] [the] City [[G4172]] of David [[G1138]] a Savior [[G4990]] has been born [[G5088]] to you. [[G4771]] He [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] Christ [[G5547]] [the] Lord! [[G2962]] 
12 And [[G2532]] this [will be] [[G3778]] a [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] to you: [[G4771]] You will find [[G2147]] a baby [[G1025]] wrapped in swaddling cloths [[G4683]] and [[G2532]] lying [[G2749]] in [[G1722]] a manger.” [[G5336]] 
13 And [[G2532]] suddenly [[G1810]] there appeared [[G1096]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] a great multitude [[G4128]] of [the] heavenly [[G3770]] host, [[G4756]] praising [[G134]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] saying: [[G3004]] 
14 “Glory [[G1391]] to God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] [the] highest, [[G5310]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] peace [[G1515]] to [[G1722]] men [[G444]] on whom His favor rests!” [[G2107]] 
15 When [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] had left [[G565]] them [[G846]] [and gone] into [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] the [[G3588]] shepherds [[G4166]] said [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] one another, [[G240]] “Let us go [[G1330]] to [[G2193]] Bethlehem [[G965]] and [[G2532]] see [[G3708]] this [[G3778]] [thing] [[G4487]] that [[G3588]] has happened, [[G1096]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has made known [[G1107]] to us. [[G1473]] 
16 So [[G2532]] they hurried off [[G4692]] and [[G2532]] found [[G429]] Mary [[G3137]] and [[G2532]] Joseph [[G2501]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] baby, [[G1025]] [who] was lying [[G2749]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] manger. [[G5336]] 
17 [After] [[G1161]] they had seen [the Child], [[G3708]] they spread [[G1107]] the [[G3588]] message [[G4487]] they had received [[G2980]] about [[G4012]] [Him]. [[G3813]] 
18 And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] heard [it] [[G191]] were amazed [[G2296]] at [[G4012]] what [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] shepherds [[G4166]] said [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] them. [[G846]] 
19 But [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] treasured up [[G4933]] all [[G3956]] these [[G3778]] things [[G4487]] [and] pondered [them] [[G4820]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] heart. [[G2588]] 
20 The [[G3588]] shepherds [[G4166]] returned, [[G5290]] glorifying [[G1392]] and [[G2532]] praising [[G134]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] they had heard [[G191]] and [[G2532]] seen, [[G3708]] which was just as [[G2531]] [the angel] had told [[G2980]] them. [[G846]] 
21 When [[G3753]] [the] eight [[G3638]] days [[G2250]] until [[G3588]] His [[G846]] circumcision [[G4059]] had passed, [[G4130]] He was named [[G2564]] Jesus, [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] had given [Him] [[G2564]] before [[G4253]] He [[G846]] had been conceived. [[G4815]] 
22 And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2250]] of [[G3588]] purification [[G2512]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of Moses [[G3475]] was complete, [[G4130]] [His parents] brought [[G321]] Him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] to present [Him] [[G3936]] to the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] 
23 (as [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] [the] Law [[G3551]] of [the] Lord: [[G2962]] “Every [[G3956]] firstborn [[G1272]] male [[G730]] shall be consecrated [[G2564]] to the [[G3588]] Lord”), [[G2962]] 
24 and [[G2532]] to offer [[G1325]] [the] sacrifice [[G2378]] specified [[G2046]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of [the] Lord: [[G2962]] “A pair [[G2201]] of turtledoves [[G5167]] or [[G2228]] two [[G1417]] young [[G3502]] pigeons.” [[G4058]] 
25 Now [[G2532]] there was [[G1510]] a man [[G444]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] named [[G3686]] Simeon, [[G4826]] [who] [[G444]] [was] righteous [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] devout. [[G2126]] He was waiting for [[G4327]] [the] consolation [[G3874]] of Israel, [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] was [[G1510]] upon [[G1909]] him. [[G846]] 
26 The [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] had [[G1510]] revealed [[G5537]] to him [[G846]] [that he would] not [[G3361]] see [[G3708]] death [[G2288]] before [[G4250]] he had seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] Christ. [[G5547]] 
27 [Led by] [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] he went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple courts. [[G2411]] And [[G2532]] when [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] parents [[G1118]] brought in [[G1521]] the [[G3588]] child [[G3813]] Jesus [[G2424]] to do [[G4160]] for [[G4012]] Him [[G846]] what was customary [[G1480]] under the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] 
28 [Simeon] [[G846]] took [[G1209]] Him [[G846]] in [[G1519]] [his] [[G3588]] arms [[G43]] and [[G2532]] praised [[G2127]] God, [[G2316]] saying: [[G2036]] 
29 “Sovereign Lord, [[G1203]] as [[G2596]] You [[G4771]] have promised, [[G4487]] You now dismiss [[G630]] Your [[G4771]] servant [[G1401]] in [[G1722]] peace. [[G1515]] 
30 For [[G3754]] my [[G1473]] eyes [[G3788]] have seen [[G3708]] Your [[G4771]] salvation, [[G4992]] 
31 which [[G3739]] You have prepared [[G2090]] in [[G2596]] the sight [[G4383]] of all [[G3956]] people, [[G2992]] 
32 a light [[G5457]] for [[G1519]] revelation [[G602]] to [the] Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] for glory [[G1391]] to Your [[G4771]] people [[G2992]] Israel.” [[G2474]] 
33 [The Child’s] [[G846]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother [[G3384]] were [[G1510]] amazed [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] what [[G3588]] was spoken [[G2980]] about [[G4012]] Him. [[G846]] 
34 Then [[G2532]] Simeon [[G4826]] blessed [[G2127]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] Mary: [[G3137]] “Behold, [[G2400]] this [Child] [[G3778]] is appointed [[G2749]] [to cause] [[G1519]] [the] rise [[G386]] and [[G2532]] fall [[G4431]] of many [[G4183]] in [[G1722]] Israel, [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] [to be] [[G1519]] a sign [[G4592]] that will be spoken against, [[G483]] 
35 so that [[G3704]] [the] thoughts [[G1261]] of [[G1537]] many [[G4183]] hearts [[G2588]] will be revealed— [[G601]] and [[G2532]] a sword [[G4501]] will pierce [[G1330]] your [[G4771]] soul [[G5590]] as well.” [[G1161]] 
36 There was [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] a prophetess [[G4398]] [named] Anna, [[G451]] [the] daughter [[G2364]] of Phanuel, [[G5323]] of [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Asher, [[G768]] [who] [[G3778]] was well along [[G4260]] in [[G1722]] years. [[G2250]] She had been married [[G2198]] for seven [[G2033]] years, [[G2094]] 
37 and then [[G2532]] [was] a widow [[G5503]] [to the age of] [[G2193]] eighty-four. [[G3589]] [She] [[G3739]] never left [[G868]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] [but] worshiped [[G3000]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day, [[G2250]] fasting [[G3521]] and [[G2532]] praying. [[G1162]] 
38 Coming forward [[G2186]] at that [[G3588]] moment, [[G5610]] she [[G846]] gave thanks [[G437]] to God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] spoke [[G2980]] about [[G4012]] [the Child] [[G846]] to all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] were waiting for [[G4327]] [the] redemption [[G3085]] of Jerusalem. [[G2419]] 
39 When [[G5613]] [Jesus’ parents] had done [[G5055]] everything [[G3956]] required by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of [the] Lord, [[G2962]] they returned [[G1994]] to [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] to [[G1519]] their [own] [[G1438]] town [[G4172]] of Nazareth. [[G3478]] 
40 And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Child [[G3813]] grew [[G837]] and [[G2532]] became strong. [[G2901]] He was filled [[G4137]] with wisdom, [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] [the] grace [[G5485]] of God [[G2316]] was [[G1510]] upon [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]] 
41 Every [[G2596]] year [[G2094]] His [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] for the [[G3588]] Feast [[G1859]] of the [[G3588]] Passover. [[G3957]] 
42 And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] He was [[G1096]] twelve [[G1427]] years [old], [[G2094]] they [[G846]] went up [[G305]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] custom [[G1485]] of the [[G3588]] Feast. [[G1859]] 
43 [When] [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] were over [[G5048]] [and] [[G1722]] they [[G846]] were returning [home], [[G5290]] the [[G3588]] boy [[G3816]] Jesus [[G2424]] remained behind [[G5278]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] but [[G2532]] His [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] were unaware [He had stayed]. [[G1097]] 
44 Assuming [[G3543]] He [[G846]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] their [[G3588]] company, [[G4923]] they traveled on [[G3598]] for a day [[G2250]] [before] [[G2532]] they began to look [[G327]] for Him [[G846]] among [[G1722]] [their] [[G3588]] relatives [[G4773]] and [[G2532]] friends. [[G1110]] 
45 When [[G2532]] they could not find [Him], [[G2147]] they returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to search for [[G327]] Him. [[G846]] 
46 Finally, [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] they found [[G2147]] Him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] sitting [[G2516]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] teachers, [[G1320]] listening to [[G191]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] asking them questions. [[G1905]] 
47 And [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] Him [[G846]] were amazed [[G1839]] at [[G1909]] His [[G846]] understanding [[G4907]] and [[G2532]] [His] [[G3588]] answers. [[G612]] 
48 When [[G2532]] [His parents] saw [[G3708]] Him, [[G846]] they were astonished. [[G1605]] “Child, [[G5043]] why [[G5101]] have You done [[G4160]] this [[G3779]] to us?” [[G1473]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] asked. [[G2036]] “Your [[G4771]] father [[G3962]] and I [[G2504]] have been anxiously searching [[G2212]] for You.” [[G4771]] 
49 “Why [[G5101]] were you looking for [[G2212]] Me?” [[G1473]] He asked. [[G2036]] “Did you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] had [[G1163]] to be [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] Father’s [[G3962]] [ house ]?” [[G3588]] 
50 But [[G2532]] they [[G846]] did not understand [[G4920]] the [[G3588]] statement [[G4487]] He was making [[G2980]] to them. [[G846]] 
51 Then [[G2532]] He went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Nazareth [[G3478]] with [[G3326]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] was [[G1510]] subject [[G5293]] to them. [[G846]] But [[G2532]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] treasured up [[G1301]] all [[G3956]] these [[G3778]] things [[G4487]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] heart. [[G2588]] 
52 And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] grew [[G4298]] in [[G1722]] wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] stature, [[G2244]] and [[G2532]] in favor [[G5485]] with [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] man. [[G444]]
