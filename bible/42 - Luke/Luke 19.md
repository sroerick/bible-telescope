# Luke 19
[[Luke 18|←]] • [[Luke 20|→]]
1 Then [[G2532]] Jesus entered [[G1525]] Jericho [[G2410]] [and] was passing through. [[G1330]] 
2 And [[G2532]] [there was] [[G2400]] a man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Zacchaeus, [[G2195]] a chief tax collector, [[G754]] [who was] [[G846]] very wealthy. [[G4145]] 
3 He was trying [[G2212]] to see [[G3708]] who [[G5101]] Jesus [[G2424]] was, [[G1510]] but [[G2532]] could not [see] [[G1410]] over [[G575]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] because [[G3754]] he was [[G1510]] small [[G3398]] in stature. [[G2244]] 
4 So [[G2532]] he ran [[G4390]] on [[G1519]] ahead [[G1715]] [and] climbed [[G305]] a sycamore tree [[G4809]] to [[G2443]] see [[G3708]] Him, [[G846]] since [[G3754]] [Jesus] was about [[G3195]] to pass [[G1330]] that [way]. [[G1565]] 
5 When [[G2532]] [Jesus] came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] that [[G3588]] place, [[G5117]] [He] [[G2424]] looked up [[G308]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Zacchaeus, [[G2195]] hurry [[G4692]] down, [[G2597]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] stay [[G3306]] at [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] house [[G3624]] today.” [[G4594]] 
6 So [[G2532]] [Zacchaeus] hurried [[G4692]] down [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] welcomed [[G5264]] Him [[G846]] joyfully. [[G5463]] 
7 And [[G2532]] all [who] [[G3956]] saw [this] [[G3708]] began to grumble, [[G1234]] saying, [[G3004]] “He has gone [[G1525]] to be the guest [[G2647]] of [[G3844]] a sinful [[G268]] man!” [[G435]] 
8 But [[G1161]] Zacchaeus [[G2195]] stood up [[G2476]] [and] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] “Look, [[G2400]] Lord, [[G2962]] half [[G2255]] of [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] possessions [[G5225]] I give [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] poor, [[G4434]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] I have cheated [[G4811]] anyone, [[G5100]] I will repay [it] [[G591]] fourfold. [[G5073]] 
9 Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] “Today [[G4594]] salvation [[G4991]] has come [[G1096]] to this [[G3778]] house, [[G3624]] because [[G2530]] [this man] [[G846]] too [[G2532]] is [[G1510]] a son [[G5207]] of Abraham. [[G11]] 
10 For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] came [[G2064]] to seek [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] to save [[G4982]] the [[G3588]] lost.” [[G622]] 
11 While [[G1161]] [the people] [[G846]] were listening to [[G191]] [this], [[G3778]] [Jesus] proceeded [[G4369]] to tell [them] [[G2036]] a parable, [[G3850]] because [[G1223]] He [[G846]] was [[G1510]] near [[G1451]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] thought [[G1380]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] would [[G3195]] appear [[G398]] imminently. [[G3916]] 
12 So [[G3767]] He said, [[G2036]] “A [[G5100]] man [[G444]] of noble birth [[G2104]] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] a distant [[G3112]] country [[G5561]] to lay claim [[G2983]] to his [[G1438]] kingship [[G932]] and then [[G2532]] return. [[G5290]] 
13 Beforehand, [[G1161]] [he] called [[G2564]] ten [[G1176]] of his [[G1438]] servants [[G1401]] [and] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] ten [[G1176]] minas. [[G3414]] ‘Conduct business [with this] [[G4231]] until [[G1722]] I return,’ [[G2064]] he said. [[G2036]] 
14 But [[G1161]] his [[G846]] subjects [[G4177]] hated [[G3404]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] a delegation [[G4242]] after [[G3694]] him [[G846]] to say, [[G3004]] ‘We do not want [[G2309]] this [man] [[G3778]] to rule [[G936]] over [[G1909]] us.’ [[G1473]] 
15 When [[G2532]] he [[G846]] returned [[G1880]] from procuring [[G2983]] [his] [[G3588]] kingship, [[G932]] he summoned [[G2036]] [the] [[G3778]] servants [[G1401]] to whom [[G3739]] he had given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] money, [[G694]] to [[G2443]] find out [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] each one [[G5101]] had earned. [[G1281]] 
16 The [[G3588]] first [servant] [[G4413]] came forward [[G3854]] [and] said, [[G3004]] ‘Master, [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] mina [[G3414]] has produced [[G4333]] ten [[G1176]] {more} minas.’ [[G3414]] 
17 [His master] replied, [[G2036]] ‘Well done, [[G2095]] good [[G18]] servant! [[G1401]] Because [[G3754]] you have been [[G1096]] faithful [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] a very small matter, [[G1646]] you [[G1510]] shall have [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G1883]] ten [[G1176]] cities.’ [[G4172]] 
18 The [[G3588]] second [servant] [[G1208]] came [[G2064]] [and] said, [[G3004]] ‘Master, [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] mina [[G3414]] has made [[G4160]] five [[G4002]] minas.’ [[G3414]] 
19 And [[G1161]] to this one [[G3778]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘You [[G4771]] shall [have authority] [[G1096]] over [[G1883]] five [[G4002]] cities.’ [[G4172]] 
20 Then [[G2532]] another [servant] [[G2087]] came [[G2064]] [and] said, [[G3004]] ‘Master, [[G2962]] here is [[G2400]] your [[G4771]] mina, [[G3414]] which [[G3739]] I have laid away [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] a piece of cloth. [[G4676]] 
21 For [[G1063]] I was afraid of [[G5399]] you, [[G4771]] because [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] a harsh [[G840]] man. [[G444]] You withdraw [[G142]] what [[G3739]] you did not deposit [[G5087]] and [[G2532]] reap [[G2325]] what [[G3739]] you did not sow.’ [[G4687]] 
22 [His master] replied, [[G3004]] ‘[You] wicked [[G4190]] servant, [[G1401]] I will judge [[G2919]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] [own words]. [[G4750]] [So] you knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] a harsh [[G840]] man, [[G444]] withdrawing [[G142]] what [[G3739]] I did not deposit [[G5087]] and [[G2532]] reaping [[G2325]] what [[G3739]] I did not sow? [[G4687]] 
23 Why [[G1223]] then [[G2532]] did you not deposit [[G1325]] my [[G1473]] money [[G694]] in [[G1909]] [the] bank, [[G5132]] and [[G2504]] upon my return [[G2064]] I could have collected [[G4238]] it [[G846]] with [[G4862]] interest?’ [[G5110]] 
24 Then [[G2532]] he told [[G2036]] those [[G3588]] standing by, [[G3936]] ‘Take [[G142]] the [[G3588]] mina [[G3414]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] give [it] [[G1325]] to the [one who] [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] ten [[G1176]] minas.’ [[G3414]] 
25 ‘Master,’ [[G2962]] they said, [[G2036]] ‘he [already] has [[G2192]] ten!’ [[G1176]] 
26 ‘I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] will be given [more]; [[G1325]] but [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] {does} not [[G3361]] have, [[G2192]] even [[G2532]] what [[G3739]] he has [[G2192]] will be taken away [[G142]] from [him]. [[G575]] 
27 And [[G4133]] these [[G3778]] enemies [[G2190]] of mine [[G1473]] who [[G3588]] were unwilling [for] [[G2309]] me [[G1473]] to rule [[G936]] over [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] bring [them] [[G71]] here [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] slay [[G2695]] them [[G846]] in front of [[G1715]] me.’” [[G1473]] 
28 After [[G2532]] [Jesus] had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] He went on [[G4198]] ahead, [[G1715]] going up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]] 
29 As [[G5613]] He approached [[G1448]] Bethphage [[G967]] and [[G2532]] Bethany [[G963]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of [[G2564]] Olives, [[G1636]] He sent [[G649]] two [[G1417]] of [His] [[G3588]] disciples. [[G3101]] 
30 “Go [[G5217]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] village [[G2968]] ahead [of you],” [[G2713]] He said. [[G3004]] “As you enter [it], [[G1531]] you will find [[G2147]] a colt [[G4454]] tied [there], [[G1210]] on [[G1909]] which [[G3739]] no one [[G3762]] {has} ever [[G4455]] sat. [[G2523]] Untie [[G3089]] it [[G846]] [and] bring [it here]. [[G71]] 
31 If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] asks [[G2065]] why [[G1223]] you are untying [it], [[G3089]] tell [him] [[G2046]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] needs [[G5532]] it.” [[G846]] 
32 So [[G1161]] those [[G3588]] who were sent [[G649]] went out [[G565]] [and] found [it] [[G2147]] just as [[G2531]] [Jesus] had told [[G2036]] them. [[G846]] 
33 As [[G1161]] they [[G846]] were untying [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] colt, [[G4454]] its [[G846]] owners [[G2962]] asked, [[G2036]] “Why [[G5101]] are you untying [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] colt?” [[G4454]] 
34 “The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] needs [[G5532]] it,” [[G846]] they answered. [[G2036]] 
35 Then [[G2532]] they brought [[G71]] [the colt] [[G846]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] threw [[G1977]] their [[G846]] cloaks [[G2440]] over [[G1909]] [it], [[G4454]] [and] put [Jesus] on [it]. [[G1913]] 
36 As He [[G846]] rode along, [[G4198]] [ the people ] spread [[G5291]] their [[G1438]] cloaks [[G2440]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] road. [[G3598]] 
37 And [[G1161]] as He [[G846]] approached [[G1448]] the [[G3588]] descent [[G2600]] from the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of Olives, [[G1636]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G537]] multitude [[G4128]] of [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] began [[G756]] to praise [[G134]] God [[G2316]] joyfully [[G5463]] in a loud voice [[G5456]] for [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] [the] miracles [[G1411]] they had seen: [[G3708]] 
38 “Blessed is [[G2127]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] who comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord!” [[G2962]] “Peace [[G1515]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] in [[G1722]] [the] highest!” [[G5310]] 
39 But [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] in [[G575]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] rebuke [[G2008]] Your [[G4771]] disciples!” [[G3101]] 
40 “I tell [[G3004]] you,” [[G4771]] He answered, [[G611]] “if [[G1437]] they [[G3778]] remain silent, [[G4623]] the very [[G3588]] stones [[G3037]] will cry out.” [[G2896]] 
41 As [[G5613]] [Jesus] approached [Jerusalem] [[G1448]] [and] saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] He wept [[G2799]] over [[G1909]] it [[G846]] 
42 [and] said, [[G3004]] “If only [[G1487]] you had known [[G1097]] on [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] day [[G2250]] what [[G3588]] [would bring] [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] peace! [[G1515]] But [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] it is hidden [[G2928]] from [[G575]] your [[G4771]] eyes. [[G3788]] 
43 For [[G3754]] [the] days [[G2250]] will come [[G2240]] upon [[G1909]] you [[G4771]] [when] [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] enemies [[G2190]] will barricade [[G5482]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] surround [[G4033]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] hem you in [[G4912]] on every side. [[G3840]] 
44 They will level you to the ground— [[G1474]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] [the] [[G4771]] children [[G5043]] within [[G1722]] your [walls]. [[G4771]] They will not leave [[G863]] one stone [[G3037]] on [[G1909]] [another], [[G3037]] because [[G473]] you did not recognize [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] of your [[G4771]] visitation [from God].” [[G1984]] 
45 Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] [and] began [[G756]] to drive out [[G1544]] those who [[G3588]] were selling [there]. [[G4453]] 
46 He declared [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “It is written: [[G1125]] ‘My [[G1473]] house [[G3624]] will be [[G1510]] a house [[G3624]] of prayer.’ [[G4335]] But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] have made [[G4160]] it [[G846]] ‘a den [[G4693]] of robbers.’” [[G3027]] 
47 [Jesus] was [[G1510]] teaching [[G1321]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] every [[G2596]] day, [[G2250]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] leaders [[G4413]] of the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] were intent [[G2212]] on killing [[G622]] Him. [[G846]] 
48 Yet [[G2532]] they could not find [[G2147]] a way [[G5101]] to do [so], [[G4160]] because [[G1063]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] hung [[G1582]] on His words. [[G191]]
