# Nahum 3
[[Nahum 2|←]] • [[Habakkuk 1|→]]
1 Woe [[H1945]] to the city [[H5892]] of blood, [[H1818]] full [[H3605]] of lies, [[H3585]] full of [[H4395]] plunder, [[H6563]] never [[H3808]] without [[H4185]] prey. [[H2964]] 
2 The crack [[H6963]] of the whip, [[H7752]] the rumble [[H6963]] of the wheel, [[H212]] galloping [[H1725]] horse [[H5483]] and bounding [[H7540]] chariot! [[H4818]] 
3 Charging [[H5927]] horseman, [[H6571]] flashing [[H3851]] sword, [[H2719]] shining [[H1300]] spear; [[H2595]] heaps [[H7230]] of slain, [[H2491]] mounds [[H3514]] of corpses, [[H6297]] dead bodies [[H1472]] without [[H369]] end— [[H7097]] they stumble [[H3782]] over their dead— [[H1472]] 
4 because of the many [[H7230]] harlotries [[H2181]] of the harlot, [[H2181]] the seductive [[H2580]] mistress [[H1172]] of sorcery, [[H3785]] who betrays [[H4376]] nations [[H1471]] by her prostitution [[H2183]] and clans [[H4940]] by her witchcraft. [[H3785]] 
5 “Behold, [[H2005]] I [am] against you,” [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] “I will lift [[H1540]] your skirts [[H7757]] over [[H5921]] your face. [[H6440]] I will show [[H7200]] your nakedness [[H4626]] to the nations [[H1471]] and your shame [[H7036]] to the kingdoms. [[H4467]] 
6 I will pelt [[H7993]] you [[H5921]] with filth [[H8251]] and treat you with contempt; [[H5034]] I will make [[H7760]] a spectacle of you. [[H7210]] 
7 Then [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] who see you [[H7200]] will recoil [[H5074]] from you [[H4480]] and say, [[H559]] ‘Nineveh [[H5210]] is devastated; [[H7703]] who [[H4310]] will grieve for her?’ [[H5110]] Where [[H370]] can I find [[H1245]] comforters [[H5162]] for you?”  
8 Are you better [[H3190]] than Thebes, [[H4996]] situated [[H3427]] by the Nile [[H2975]] with water [[H4325]] around her, [[H5439]] whose [[H834]] rampart [[H2426]] was the sea, [[H3220]] whose wall [[H2346]] was the water? [[H3220]] 
9 Cush [[H3568]] and Egypt [[H4714]] were her boundless [[H369]] strength; [[H6109]] Put [[H6316]] and Libya [[H3864]] were [[H1961]] her allies. [[H5833]] 
10 Yet [[H1571]] she [[H1931]] became an exile; [[H1473]] she went [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]] Her infants [[H5768]] were dashed to pieces [[H7376]] at the head [[H7218]] of every [[H3605]] street. [[H2351]] They cast [[H3032]] lots [[H1486]] for [[H5921]] her dignitaries, [[H3513]] and all [[H3605]] her nobles [[H1419]] were bound [[H7576]] in chains. [[H2131]] 
11 You [[H859]] too [[H1571]] will become drunk; [[H7937]] You will go [[H1961]] into hiding [[H5956]] and [[H1571]] seek [[H1245]] refuge [[H4581]] from the enemy. [[H341]] 
12 All [[H3605]] your fortresses [[H4013]] are fig trees [[H8384]] with [[H5973]] the first ripe figs; [[H1061]] when [[H518]] shaken, [[H5128]] they fall [[H5307]] into [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the eater! [[H398]] 
13 Behold, [[H2009]] your troops [[H5971]] are like your women; [[H802]] the gates [[H8179]] of your land [[H776]] are wide open [[H6605]] to your enemies; [[H341]] fire [[H784]] consumes [[H398]] their bars. [[H1280]] 
14 Draw [[H7579]] your  water [[H4325]] for the siege; [[H4692]] strengthen [[H2388]] your fortresses. [[H4013]] Work [[H935]] the clay [[H2916]] and tread [[H7429]] the mortar; [[H2563]] repair [[H2388]] the brick [kiln]! [[H4404]] 
15 There [[H8033]] the fire [[H784]] will devour you; [[H398]] the sword [[H2719]] will cut you down [[H3772]] and consume you [[H398]] like a young locust. [[H3218]] Make yourself many [[H3513]] like the young locust; [[H3218]] make yourself many [[H3513]] like the swarming locust! [[H697]] 
16 You have multiplied [[H7235]] your merchants [[H7402]] more than the stars [[H3556]] of the sky. [[H8064]] The young locust [[H3218]] strips the land [[H6584]] and flies away. [[H5774]] 
17 Your guardsmen [[H4502]] are like the swarming locust, [[H697]] and your scribes [[H2951]] like clouds of locusts, [[H1462]] that settle [[H2583]] on the walls [[H1448]] on a cold [[H7135]] day. [[H3117]] When the sun [[H8121]] rises, [[H2224]] they fly away, [[H5074]] and no [[H3808]] one knows [[H3045]] where. [[H335]] 
18 O king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] your shepherds [[H7462]] slumber; [[H5123]] your officers [[H117]] sleep. [[H7931]] Your people [[H5971]] are scattered [[H6335]] on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] with no one [[H369]] to gather them. [[H6908]] 
19 There is no [[H369]] healing [[H3545]] for your injury; [[H7667]] your wound [[H4347]] is severe. [[H2470]] All [[H3605]] who hear [[H8085]] the news of you [[H8088]] will applaud [[H8628]] your [downfall], [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] has not [[H3808]] experienced [[H5674]] your endless [[H8548]] cruelty? [[H7451]]
