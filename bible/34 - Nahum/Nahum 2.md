[[Nahum 1|←]] • [[Nahum 3|→]]
1 One who scatters [[H6327]] advances [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] you, [O Nineveh]. [[H6440]] Guard [[H5341]] the fortress! [[H4694]] Watch [[H6822]] the road! [[H1870]] Brace yourself [[H2388]] ! [[H4975]] Summon [[H553]] all [[H3966]] your strength! [[H3581]] 
2 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will restore [[H7725]] the splendor [[H1347]] of Jacob [[H3290]] like the splendor [[H1347]] of Israel, [[H3478]] though [[H3588]] destroyers [[H1238]] have laid them waste [[H1238]] and ruined [[H7843]] the branches of their vine. [[H2156]] 
3 The shields [[H4043]] of his mighty men [[H1368]] are red; [[H119]] the valiant warriors [[H376]] are dressed in scarlet. [[H8529]] The fittings [[H6393]] of the chariots [[H7393]] flash like fire [[H784]] on the day [[H3117]] they are prepared, [[H3559]] and the spears of cypress [[H1265]] have been brandished. [[H7477]] 
4 The chariots [[H7393]] dash [[H1984]] through the streets; [[H2351]] they rush around [[H8264]] the plazas, [[H7339]] appearing [[H4758]] like torches, [[H3940]] darting about [[H7323]] like lightning. [[H1300]] 
5 He summons [[H2142]] his nobles; [[H117]] they stumble [[H3782]] as they advance. [[H1979]] They race [[H4116]] to its wall; [[H2346]] the protective shield [[H5526]] is set in place. [[H3559]] 
6 The river [[H5104]] gates [[H8179]] are thrown open, [[H6605]] and the palace [[H1964]] erodes away. [[H4127]] 
7 It is decreed that [[H5324]] [the city] be exiled [[H1540]] and carried away; [[H5927]] her maidservants [[H519]] moan [[H5090]] like [[H6963]] doves, [[H3123]] and beat upon [[H8608]] their breasts. [[H3824]] 
8 Nineveh [[H5210]] has been like a pool [[H1295]] of water [[H4325]] throughout [[H1931]] her days, [[H3117]] but now [[H1992]] it is draining away. [[H5127]] “Stop! [[H5975]] Stop!” they cry, [[H5975]] but no [[H369]] one turns back. [[H6437]] 
9 “Plunder [[H962]] the silver! [[H3701]] Plunder [[H962]] the gold!” [[H2091]] There is no [[H369]] end [[H7097]] to the treasure, [[H8498]] an abundance [[H3519]] of every [[H3605]] precious [[H2532]] thing. [[H3627]] 
10 She is emptied! [[H950]] Yes, she is desolate [[H4003]] and laid waste! [[H1110]] Hearts [[H3820]] melt, [[H4549]] knees [[H1290]] knock, [[H6375]] bodies [[H4975]] tremble, [[H2479]] and every [[H3605]] face [[H6440]] grows pale! [[H6908]] 
11 Where [[H346]] is the lions’ [[H738]] lair [[H4583]] or the feeding ground [[H4829]] of the young lions, [[H3715]] where [[H834]] the lion [[H738]] and lioness [[H3833]] prowled [[H1980]] with [their] [[H738]] cubs, [[H1482]] with nothing [[H369]] to frighten them away? [[H2729]] 
12 The lion [[H738]] mauled [[H2963]] enough for [[H1767]] its cubs [[H1484]] and strangled prey [[H2614]] for the lioness. [[H3833]] It filled [[H4390]] its dens [[H2356]] with the kill, [[H2964]] and its lairs [[H4585]] with mauled prey. [[H2966]] 
13 “Behold, [[H2005]] I am against you,” [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] “I will send your chariots [[H7393]] up [[H1197]] in smoke [[H6227]] and the sword [[H2719]] will devour [[H398]] your young lions. [[H3715]] I will cut off [[H3772]] your prey [[H2964]] from the earth, [[H776]] and the voices [[H6963]] of your messengers [[H4397]] will no longer [[H3808]] be heard.” [[H8085]]
