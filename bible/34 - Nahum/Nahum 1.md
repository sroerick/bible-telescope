# Nahum 1
[[Micah 7|←]] • [[Nahum 2|→]]
1 This is the oracle [[H4853]] of Nineveh, [[H5210]] the book [[H5612]] of the vision [[H2377]] of Nahum [[H5151]] the Elkoshite: [[H512]] 
2 The LORD [[H3069]] is a jealous [[H7072]] and avenging [[H5358]] God; [[H410]] the LORD [[H3069]] is avenging [[H5358]] and full of wrath. [[H1167]] The LORD [[H3069]] takes vengeance [[H5358]] on His foes [[H6862]] and reserves [wrath] [[H5201]] for His enemies. [[H341]] 
3 The LORD [[H3068]] is slow [[H750]] to anger [[H639]] and great [[H1419]] in power; [[H1419]] the LORD [[H3068]] will by no means [[H3808]] leave the guilty unpunished. [[H5352]] His path [[H1870]] is in the whirlwind [[H5492]] and storm, [[H8183]] and clouds [[H6051]] are the dust [[H80]] beneath His feet. [[H7272]] 
4 He rebukes [[H1605]] the sea [[H3220]] and dries it up; [[H3001]] He makes all [[H3605]] the rivers [[H5104]] run dry. [[H2717]] Bashan [[H1316]] and Carmel [[H3760]] wither, [[H536]] and the flower [[H6525]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] wilts. [[H536]] 
5 The mountains [[H2022]] quake [[H7493]] before Him, [[H4480]] and the hills [[H1389]] melt away; [[H4127]] the earth [[H776]] trembles [[H5375]] at His presence— [[H6440]] the world [[H8398]] and all [[H3605]] its dwellers. [[H3427]] 
6 Who [[H4310]] can withstand [[H6440]] His indignation? [[H2195]] Who [[H4310]] can endure [[H6965]] His burning anger? [[H2740]] His wrath [[H2534]] is poured out [[H5413]] like fire; [[H784]] even rocks [[H6697]] are shattered [[H5422]] before Him. [[H4480]] 
7 The LORD [[H3068]] is good, [[H2896]] a stronghold [[H4581]] in the day [[H3117]] of distress; [[H6869]] He cares for [[H3045]] those who trust [[H2620]] in Him.  
8 But with an overflowing [[H5674]] flood, [[H7858]] He will make [[H6213]] an end [[H3617]] [of Nineveh] [[H4725]] and pursue [[H7291]] His enemies [[H341]] into darkness. [[H2822]] 
9 Whatever [[H4100]] you plot [[H2803]] against [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] will bring [[H6213]] to an end. [[H3617]] Affliction [[H6869]] will not [[H3808]] rise up [[H6965]] a second time. [[H6471]] 
10 For [[H3588]] they will be entangled [[H5440]] as with [[H5704]] thorns [[H5518]] and consumed [[H398]] like the drink [[H5435]] of a drunkard— [[H5433]] like stubble [[H7179]] that is fully [[H4390]] dry. [[H3002]] 
11 From you, [O Nineveh], [[H4480]] comes forth [[H3318]] a plotter [[H2803]] of evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] a counselor [[H3289]] of wickedness. [[H1100]] 
12 This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Though [[H518]] they are allied [[H8003]] and numerous, [[H7227]] yet [[H3651]] they will be cut down [[H1494]] and pass away. [[H5674]] Though I have afflicted you, [O Judah], [[H6031]] I will afflict [[H6031]] you no [[H3808]] longer. [[H5750]] 
13 For from you [[H5921]] I will now [[H6258]] break off [[H7665]] his yoke [[H4132]] and tear away [[H5423]] your shackles.” [[H4147]] 
14 The LORD [[H3068]] has issued a command [[H6680]] concerning you, [O Nineveh]: [[H5921]] “There will be no [[H3808]] descendants [[H2232]] to carry on your name. [[H8034]] I will cut off [[H3772]] the carved image [[H6459]] and cast idol [[H4541]] from the house [[H1004]] of your gods; [[H430]] I will prepare [[H7760]] your grave, [[H6913]] for [[H3588]] you are contemptible.” [[H7043]] 
15 Look [[H2009]] to [[H5921]] the mountains— [[H2022]] the feet [[H7272]] of one who brings good news, [[H1319]] who proclaims [[H8085]] peace! [[H7965]] Celebrate [[H2287]] your feasts, [[H2282]] O Judah; [[H3063]] fulfill [[H7999]] your vows. [[H5088]] For [[H3588]] the wicked [[H1100]] will never [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] march through [[H5674]] you; [[H5674]] they will be utterly [[H3605]] cut off. [[H3772]]
