1 How [[H2005]] beautiful [you are], [[H3303]] my darling! [[H7474]] How [[H2005]] very beautiful! [[H3303]] Your eyes [[H5869]] are [like] doves [[H3123]] behind [[H1157]] your veil. [[H6777]] Your hair [[H8181]] is like a flock [[H5739]] of goats [[H5795]] streaming down [[H1570]] Mount [[H2022]] Gilead. [[H1568]] 
2 Your teeth [[H8127]] are like a flock [[H5739]] of newly shorn sheep [[H7094]] coming up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the washing; [[H7367]] each [[H3605]] has its twin, [[H8382]] and not one [[H369]] [is] lost. [[H7909]] 
3 Your lips [[H8193]] are like a scarlet [[H8144]] ribbon, [[H2339]] and your mouth [[H4057]] is lovely. [[H5000]] Your brow [[H7541]] is like a slice [[H6400]] of pomegranate [[H7416]] behind [[H1157]] your veil. [[H6777]] 
4 Your neck [[H6677]] is like the tower [[H4026]] of David, [[H1732]] built [[H1129]] with rows of stones; [[H8530]] on it [[H5921]] hang [[H8518]] a thousand [[H505]] shields, [[H4043]] all [[H3605]] round shields [[H7982]] of the warriors. [[H1368]] 
5 Your breasts [[H7699]] are like two [[H8147]] fawns, [[H6082]] twins [[H8380]] of a gazelle [[H6646]] grazing [[H7462]] among the lilies. [[H7799]] 
6 Before [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] breaks [[H6315]] and shadows [[H6752]] flee, [[H5127]] I will make my way [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the mountain [[H2022]] of myrrh [[H4753]] and to the hill [[H1389]] of frankincense. [[H3828]] 
7 You are altogether [[H3605]] beautiful, [[H3303]] my darling; [[H7474]] in  you  [there is] no [[H369]] flaw. [[H3971]] 
8 Come [[H935]] with me [[H854]] from Lebanon, [[H3844]] my bride, [[H3618]] [come] with me [[H854]] from Lebanon! [[H3844]] Descend [[H7789]] the peak [[H7218]] of Amana, [[H549]] from the summits [[H7218]] of Senir [[H8149]] and Hermon, [[H2768]] from the dens [[H4585]] of the lions, [[H738]] from the mountains [[H2042]] of the leopards. [[H5246]] 
9 You have captured my heart, [[H3823]] my sister, [[H269]] my bride; [[H3618]] you have stolen my heart [[H3823]] with one [[H259]] glance of your eyes, [[H5869]] with one [[H259]] jewel [[H6060]] of your neck. [[H6677]] 
10 How [[H4100]] delightful [[H3302]] [is] your love, [[H1730]] my sister, [[H269]] my bride. [[H3618]] Your love [[H1730]] is much [[H4100]] better [[H2895]] than wine, [[H3196]] and the fragrance [[H7381]] of your perfume [[H8081]] than all [[H3605]] spices. [[H1314]] 
11 Your lips, [[H8193]] my bride, [[H3618]] drip [[H5197]] sweetness like the honeycomb; [[H5317]] honey [[H1706]] and milk [[H2461]] are under [[H8478]] your tongue, [[H3956]] and the fragrance [[H7381]] of your garments [[H8008]] is like the aroma [[H7381]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]] 
12 My sister, [[H269]] my bride, [[H3618]] [you are] a garden [[H1588]] locked up, [[H5274]] a spring [[H1530]] enclosed, [[H5274]] a fountain [[H4599]] sealed. [[H2856]] 
13 Your branches [[H7973]] [are] an orchard [[H6508]] of pomegranates [[H7416]] with [[H5973]] the choicest [[H4022]] of fruits, [[H6529]] with henna [[H3724]] [and] [[H5973]] nard, [[H5373]] 
14 with nard [[H5373]] and saffron, [[H3750]] calamus [[H7070]] and cinnamon, [[H7076]] with [[H5973]] every kind [[H3605]] of incense [[H3828]] tree, [[H6086]] with myrrh [[H4753]] and aloes, [[H174]] with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] the finest [[H7218]] spices. [[H1314]] 
15 You are a garden [[H1588]] spring, [[H4599]] a well [[H875]] of flowing [[H2416]] water [[H4325]] streaming down [[H5140]] from [[H4480]] Lebanon. [[H3844]] 
16 Awaken, [[H5782]] O north wind, [[H6828]] and come, [[H935]] O south wind. [[H8486]] Breathe on [[H6315]] my garden, [[H1588]] and spread the fragrance [[H5140]] of its spices. [[H1314]] Let my beloved [[H1730]] come [[H935]] into his garden [[H1588]] and taste [[H398]] its choicest [[H4022]] fruits. [[H6529]]
