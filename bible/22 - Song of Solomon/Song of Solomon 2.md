[[Song of Solomon 1|←]] • [[Song of Solomon 3|→]]
1 I [[H589]] am a rose [[H2261]] of Sharon, [[H8289]] a lily [[H7799]] of the valley. [[H6010]] 
2 Like a lily [[H7799]] among [[H996]] the thorns [[H2336]] is my darling [[H7474]] among [[H996]] the maidens. [[H1323]] 
3 Like an apricot tree [[H8598]] among the trees [[H6086]] of the forest [[H3293]] is my beloved [[H1730]] among [[H996]] the young men. [[H1121]] I delight [[H2530]] to sit [[H3427]] in his shade, [[H6738]] and his fruit [[H6529]] is sweet [[H4966]] to my taste. [[H2441]] 
4 He has brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the banquet [[H3196]] hall, [[H1004]] and his banner [[H1714]] over me [is] [[H5921]] love. [[H160]] 
5 Sustain me [[H5564]] with raisins; [[H809]] refresh me [[H7502]] with apples, [[H8598]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am faint [[H2470]] with love. [[H160]] 
6 His left hand [[H8040]] is under [[H8478]] my head, [[H7218]] and his right arm [[H3225]] embraces me. [[H2263]] 
7 O daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] I adjure [[H7650]] you [[H853]] by the gazelles [[H6643]] and [[H176]] does [[H355]] of the field: [[H7704]] Do not [[H518]] arouse [[H5782]] or [[H518]] awaken [[H5782]] love [[H160]] until [[H5704]] the time is right. [[H2654]] 
8 Listen! [[H6963]] My beloved [approaches]. [[H1730]] Look! [[H2009]] Here [[H2088]] he comes, [[H935]] leaping [[H1801]] across [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] bounding [[H7092]] over [[H5921]] the hills. [[H1389]] 
9 My beloved [[H1730]] is like [[H1819]] a gazelle [[H6643]] or [[H176]] a young stag. [[H6082]] Look, [[H2009]] he [[H2088]] stands [[H5975]] behind [[H310]] our wall, [[H3796]] gazing [[H7688]] through [[H4480]] the windows, [[H2474]] peering [[H6692]] through [[H4480]] the lattice. [[H2762]] 
10 My beloved [[H1730]] calls [[H6030]] to me,  “Arise, [[H6965]] my darling. [[H7474]] Come away [[H1980]] with me,  my beautiful one. [[H3303]] 
11 For [[H3588]] now [[H2009]] the winter [[H5638]] is past; [[H5674]] the rain [[H1653]] is over [[H2498]] and gone. [[H1980]] 
12 The flowers [[H5339]] have appeared [[H7200]] in the countryside; [[H776]] the season [[H6256]] of singing [[H2158]] has come, [[H5060]] and the cooing [[H6963]] of turtledoves [[H8449]] is heard [[H8085]] in our land. [[H776]] 
13 The fig tree [[H8384]] ripens [[H2590]] its figs; [[H6291]] the blossoming [[H5563]] vines [[H1612]] spread [[H5414]] their fragrance. [[H7381]] Arise, [[H6965]] come away, [[H1980]] my darling; [[H7474]] come with me, [[H1980]] my beautiful one.” [[H3303]] 
14 O my dove [[H3123]] in the clefts [[H2288]] of the rock, [[H5553]] in the crevices [[H5643]] of the cliff, [[H4095]] let me see [[H7200]] your face, [[H4758]] let me hear [[H8085]] your voice; [[H6963]] for [[H3588]] your voice [[H6963]] is sweet, [[H6156]] and your countenance [[H4758]] is lovely. [[H5000]] 
15 Catch [[H270]] for us  the foxes— [[H7776]] the little [[H6996]] foxes [[H7776]] that ruin [[H2254]] the vineyards— [[H3754]] for our vineyards [[H3754]] are in bloom. [[H5563]] 
16 My beloved [[H1730]] is mine  and I am his; [[H589]] he pastures [his flock] [[H7462]] among the lilies. [[H7799]] 
17 Before [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] breaks [[H6315]] and shadows [[H6752]] flee, [[H5127]] turn to me, [[H5437]] my beloved, [[H1730]] and be like [[H1819]] a gazelle [[H6643]] or [[H176]] a young stag [[H6082]] on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Bether. [[H1335]]
