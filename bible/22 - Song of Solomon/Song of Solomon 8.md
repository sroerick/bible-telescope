# Song of Solomon 8
[[Song of Solomon 7|←]] • [[Isaiah 1|→]]
1 O [[H4310]] that [[H5414]] you [were] to me  like a brother [[H251]] who nursed [[H3243]] at my mother’s [[H517]] breasts! [[H7699]] If I found you [[H4672]] outdoors, [[H2351]] I would kiss you, [[H5401]] and [[H1571]] no one [[H3808]] would despise me. [[H936]] 
2 I would lead you [[H5090]] and bring you [[H935]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of my mother [[H517]] who taught me. [[H3925]] I would give you spiced [[H7544]] wine [[H3196]] to drink, [[H8248]] the nectar [[H6071]] of my pomegranates. [[H7416]] 
3 His left hand [[H8040]] is under [[H8478]] my head, [[H7218]] and his right arm [[H3225]] embraces me. [[H2263]] 
4 O daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] I adjure you: [[H7650]] Do not arouse [[H5782]] or awaken [[H5782]] love [[H160]] until [[H5704]] the time is right. [[H2654]] 
5 Who [[H4310]] is this [[H2063]] coming up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the wilderness, [[H4057]] leaning [[H7514]] on her [[H5921]] beloved? [[H1730]] I roused you [[H5782]] under [[H8478]] the apple tree; [[H8598]] there [[H8033]] your mother [[H517]] conceived you, [[H2254]] there [[H8033]] she travailed [[H2254]] and brought you forth. [[H3205]] 
6 Set [[H7760]] me as a seal [[H2368]] over [[H5921]] your heart, [[H3820]] as a seal [[H2368]] upon [[H5921]] your arm. [[H2220]] For [[H3588]] love [[H160]] is as strong [[H5794]] as death, [[H4194]] jealousy [[H7068]] as unrelenting [[H7186]] as Sheol. [[H7585]] Its sparks [[H7565]] are fiery [[H784]] flames, [[H7565]] the fiercest blaze of all. [[H7957]] 
7 Mighty [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] cannot [[H3808]] quench [[H3518]] love; [[H160]] rivers [[H5104]] cannot [[H3808]] sweep it away. [[H7857]] If [[H518]] a man [[H376]] were to give [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the riches [[H1952]] of his house [[H1004]] for love, [[H160]] it would be utterly scorned. [[H936]] 
8 We have a little [[H6996]] sister, [[H269]] and her breasts [[H7699]] are not yet grown. [[H369]] What [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] for our sister [[H269]] on the day [[H3117]] she is spoken for? [[H1696]] 
9 If [[H518]] she [[H1931]] is a wall, [[H2346]] we will build [[H1129]] a tower [[H2918]] of silver [[H3701]] to protect her. [[H5921]] If [[H518]] she [[H1931]] is a door, [[H1817]] we will enclose [[H6696]] her [[H5921]] with panels [[H3871]] of cedar. [[H730]] 
10 I [[H589]] am a wall [[H2346]] and my breasts [[H7699]] are like towers. [[H4026]] So [[H227]] I have become [[H1961]] in his eyes [[H5869]] like one who brings [[H4672]] peace. [[H7965]] 
11 Solomon [[H8010]] had [[H1961]] a vineyard [[H3754]] in Baal-hamon. [[H1174]] He leased [[H5414]] [it] [[H3754]] to the tenants. [[H5201]] For its fruit, [[H6529]] each [[H376]] was to bring [[H935]] a thousand [shekels] [[H505]] of silver. [[H3701]] 
12 [But] my own vineyard [[H3754]] is mine to give; [[H6440]] the thousand [shekels] [[H505]] are for you,  O Solomon, [[H8010]] and two hundred [[H3967]] are for those who tend [[H5201]] its fruit. [[H6529]] 
13 You who dwell [[H3427]] in the gardens, [[H1588]] [my] companions [[H2270]] are listening [[H7181]] for your voice. [[H6963]] Let me hear it! [[H8085]] 
14 Come away, [[H1272]] my beloved, [[H1730]] and be like [[H1819]] a gazelle [[H6643]] or [[H176]] a young stag [[H6082]] on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of spices. [[H1314]]
