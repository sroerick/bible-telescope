1 Now Naomi [[H5281]] had a relative [[H3045]] on her husband’s side, [[H376]] a prominent [[H1368]] man [[H376]] of noble character [[H2428]] from the clan [[H4940]] of Elimelech, [[H458]] whose name [[H8034]] [was] Boaz. [[H1162]] 
2 And Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess [[H4125]] said [[H559]] to Naomi, [[H5281]] “Please [[H4994]] let me go [[H1980]] into the fields [[H7704]] and glean [[H3950]] heads of grain [[H7641]] behind [someone] [[H310]] in whose [[H834]] sight [[H5869]] I may find [[H4672]] favor.” [[H2580]] “Go ahead, [[H1980]] my daughter,” [[H1323]] Naomi replied. [[H559]] 
3 So Ruth departed [[H1980]] and went out [[H935]] into the field [[H7704]] and gleaned [[H3950]] after [[H310]] the harvesters. [[H7114]] And she happened [[H7136]] to come [[H4745]] to the part [[H2513]] of the field [[H7704]] [belonging] to Boaz, [[H1162]] who [was] [[H834]] from the clan [[H4940]] of Elimelech. [[H458]] 
4 Just then [[H2009]] Boaz [[H1162]] arrived [[H935]] from  Bethlehem [[H1035]] and said [[H559]] to the harvesters, [[H7114]] “The LORD [[H3068]] be with you.” [[H5973]] “The LORD [[H3068]] bless you,” [[H1288]] they replied. [[H559]] 
5 And Boaz [[H1162]] asked [[H559]] the foreman [[H5288]] of [[H5921]] his harvesters, [[H7114]] “Whose [[H4310]] young woman [[H5291]] is this?” [[H2063]] 
6 The foreman [[H5288]] answered, [[H6030]] “She [is] [[H1931]] the Moabitess [[H4125]] who returned [[H7725]] with [[H5973]] Naomi [[H5281]] from the land [[H7704]] of Moab. [[H4124]] 
7 She has said, [[H559]] ‘Please [[H4994]] let me glean [[H3950]] and gather [[H622]] among the sheaves [[H6016]] behind [[H310]] the harvesters.’ [[H7114]] So she came out [[H935]] and has continued [[H5975]] from [[H227]] morning [[H1242]] until [[H5704]] now, [[H6258]] except [[H2088]] that she rested [[H3427]] a short time [[H4592]] in the shelter.” [[H1004]] 
8 Then Boaz [[H1162]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ruth, [[H7327]] “Listen, [[H8085]] my daughter. [[H1323]] Do not [[H408]] go [[H1980]] and glean [[H3950]] in another [[H312]] field, [[H7704]] and [[H1571]] do not [[H3808]] go away [[H5674]] from this [place], [[H2088]] but stay here [[H3541]] close [[H1692]] to [[H5973]] my servant girls. [[H5291]] 
9 [Let] your eyes [be on] [[H5869]] [the] [[H834]] field [[H7704]] they are harvesting, [[H7114]] and follow along [[H1980]] after [these girls]. [[H310]] Indeed, [[H3808]] I have ordered [[H6680]] the young men [[H5288]] not [[H1115]] to touch you. [[H5060]] And when you are thirsty, [[H6770]] go [[H1980]] and drink [[H8354]] from [[H834]] the jars [[H3627]] the young men [[H5288]] have filled.” [[H7579]] 
10 At this, she fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] her face, [[H6440]] bowing low [[H7812]] to the ground, [[H776]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Why [[H4069]] have I found [[H4672]] such favor [[H2580]] in your eyes [[H5869]] that you should take notice of me, [[H5234]] even though I [am] [[H595]] a foreigner?” [[H5237]] 
11 Boaz [[H1162]] replied, [[H6030]] “I have been made fully aware [[H5046]] of all [[H3605]] you have done [[H6213]] for [[H854]] your mother-in-law [[H2545]] since [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of your husband, [[H376]] how you left [[H5800]] your father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] and the land [[H776]] of your birth, [[H4138]] and how you came [[H1980]] to [[H413]] a people [[H5971]] you did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] before. [[H8543]] 
12 May the LORD [[H3068]] repay [[H7999]] your work, [[H6467]] and may you receive [[H1961]] a rich [[H8003]] reward [[H4909]] from [[H5973]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] under [[H8478]] whose [[H834]] wings [[H3671]] you have taken [[H935]] refuge.” [[H2620]] 
13 “My lord,” [[H113]] she said, [[H559]] “may I continue to find [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] for [[H3588]] you have comforted [[H5162]] and spoken [[H1696]] kindly [[H3820]] to [[H5921]] your maidservant, [[H8198]] though I [[H595]] am [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] like one [[H259]] of your servant girls.” [[H8198]] 
14 At mealtime [[H6256]] Boaz [[H1162]] said [[H559]] to her,  “Come over [[H5066]] here; [[H1988]] have [[H398]] some [[H4480]] bread [[H3899]] and dip [[H2881]] it [[H6595]] into the vinegar sauce.” [[H2558]] So she sat down [[H3427]] beside [[H6654]] the harvesters, [[H7114]] and he offered [[H6642]] her  roasted grain, [[H7039]] and she ate [[H398]] and was satisfied [[H7646]] and had some left over. [[H3498]] 
15 When [Ruth] got up [[H6965]] to glean, [[H3950]] Boaz [[H1162]] ordered [[H6680]] his young men, [[H5288]] “Even if [[H1571]] she gathers [[H3950]] among [[H996]] the sheaves, [[H6016]] do not [[H3808]] insult her. [[H3637]] 
16 Rather, [[H1571]] pull out [[H7997]] for her  [some stalks] from [[H4480]] the bundles [[H6653]] and leave [[H5800]] them for her to gather. [[H3950]] Do not [[H3808]] rebuke [[H1605]] her.”  
17 So Ruth gathered grain [[H3950]] in the field [[H7704]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] And when she beat out [[H2251]] what [[H834]] she had gleaned, [[H3950]] it was [[H1961]] about an ephah [[H374]] of barley. [[H8184]] 
18 She picked up the grain [[H5375]] and went into [[H935]] the town, [[H5892]] where her mother-in-law [[H2545]] saw [[H7200]] what [[H834]] she had gleaned. [[H3950]] And she brought out [[H3318]] what [[H834]] she had saved [[H3498]] from her meal [[H7648]] and gave it [[H5414]] to [Naomi].  
19 Then her mother-in-law [[H2545]] asked [[H559]] her,  “Where [[H375]] did you glean [[H3950]] today, [[H3117]] and where [[H575]] did you work? [[H6213]] Blessed [[H1288]] be [the man] [[H1961]] who noticed you.” [[H5234]] So she told [[H5046]] her mother-in-law [[H2545]] where [[H834]] she had worked. [[H6213]] “The name [[H8034]] of the man [[H376]] I worked [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] today [[H3117]] is Boaz,” [[H1162]] she said. [[H559]] 
20 Then Naomi [[H5281]] said [[H559]] to her daughter-in-law, [[H3618]] “May he [[H1931]] be blessed [[H1288]] by the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] has not [[H3808]] withdrawn [[H5800]] his kindness [[H2617]] from [[H854]] the living [[H2416]] or the dead.” [[H4191]] Naomi [[H5281]] continued, [[H559]] “The man [[H376]] is a close relative. [[H7138]] He [[H1931]] [is] one of our  kinsman-redeemers.” [[H1350]] 
21 Then Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess [[H4125]] said, [[H559]] “He also [[H1571]] told me, [[H559]] ‘Stay [[H1692]] with [[H5973]] my young men [[H5288]] until [[H5704]] they have finished gathering [[H3615]] all [[H3605]] my  harvest.’” [[H7105]] 
22 And Naomi [[H5281]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] her daughter-in-law [[H3618]] Ruth, [[H7327]] “My daughter, [[H1323]] it is good [[H2896]] for you to work [[H3318]] with [[H5973]] his young women, [[H5291]] so that nothing [[H3808]] will happen [[H6293]] to you  in another [[H312]] field.” [[H7704]] 
23 So Ruth stayed close [[H1692]] to the servant girls [[H5291]] of Boaz [[H1162]] to glean [[H3950]] grain until [[H5704]] the barley [[H8184]] and wheat [[H2406]] harvests [[H7105]] were finished. [[H3615]] And she lived [[H3427]] with [[H854]] her mother-in-law. [[H2545]]
