# Psalms 101
[[Psalms 100|←]] • [[Psalms 102|→]]
1 A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] I will sing [[H7891]] of [Your] loving devotion [[H2617]] and justice; [[H4941]] to You,  O LORD, [[H3068]] I will sing praise. [[H2167]] 
2 I will ponder [[H7919]] the way [[H1870]] that is blameless— [[H8549]] when [[H4970]] will You come [[H935]] to me? [[H413]] I will walk [[H1980]] in [[H7130]] my house [[H1004]] with integrity [[H8537]] of heart. [[H3824]] 
3 I will [[H3808]] set [[H7896]] no [[H1697]] worthless thing [[H1100]] before [[H5048]] my eyes. [[H5869]] I hate [[H8130]] the work [[H6213]] of those who fall away; [[H7750]] it shall not [[H3808]] cling to me. [[H1692]] 
4 A perverse [[H6141]] heart [[H3824]] shall depart [[H5493]] from me; [[H4480]] I will know [[H3045]] nothing of [[H3808]] evil. [[H7451]] 
5 Whoever slanders [[H3960]] his neighbor [[H7453]] in secret, [[H5643]] I will put to silence; [[H6789]] the one with haughty [[H1362]] eyes [[H5869]] and a proud [[H7342]] heart, [[H3824]] I will not [[H3808]] endure. [[H3201]] 
6 My eyes [will be] [[H5869]] on the faithful [[H539]] of the land, [[H776]] that they may dwell [[H3427]] with me; [[H5978]] he who walks [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of integrity [[H8549]] shall minister to me. [[H8334]] 
7 No [[H3808]] one who practices [[H6213]] deceit [[H7423]] shall dwell [[H3427]] in [[H7130]] my house; [[H1004]] no [[H3808]] one who tells [[H1696]] lies [[H8267]] shall stand [[H3559]] in my presence. [[H5869]] 
8 Every morning [[H1242]] I will remove [[H6789]] all [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7563]] of the land, [[H776]] that I may cut off [[H3772]] every [[H3605]] evildoer [[H6466]] from the city [[H5892]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
