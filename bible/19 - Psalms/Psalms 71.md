# Psalms 71
[[Psalms 70|←]] • [[Psalms 72|→]]
1 In You,  O LORD, [[H3068]] I have taken refuge; [[H2620]] let me never [[H408]] be put to shame. [[H954]] 
2 In Your justice, [[H6666]] rescue [[H5337]] and deliver me; [[H6403]] incline [[H5186]] Your ear [[H241]] and save me. [[H3467]] 
3 Be [[H1961]] my rock [[H6697]] of refuge, [[H4583]] where I can always [[H8548]] go. [[H935]] Give the command [[H6680]] to save me, [[H3467]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are my rock [[H5553]] and my fortress. [[H4686]] 
4 Deliver me, [[H6403]] O my God, [[H430]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] from the grasp [[H3709]] of the unjust [[H5765]] and ruthless. [[H2556]] 
5 For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are my hope, [[H8615]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] my confidence [[H4009]] from my youth. [[H5271]] 
6 I have leaned [[H5564]] on You [[H5921]] since birth; [[H990]] You [[H859]] pulled me [[H1491]] from my mother’s [[H517]] womb. [[H4578]] My praise [[H8416]] is always for You. [[H8548]] 
7 I have become [[H1961]] a portent [[H4159]] to many, [[H7227]] but You [[H859]] are my strong [[H5797]] refuge. [[H4268]] 
8 My mouth [[H6310]] is filled [[H4390]] [with] Your praise [[H8416]] [and with] Your splendor [[H8597]] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]] 
9 Do not [[H408]] discard me [[H7993]] in my old age; [[H2209]] do not [[H408]] forsake me [[H5800]] when my strength [[H3581]] fails. [[H3615]] 
10 For [[H3588]] my enemies [[H341]] speak against me, [[H559]] and those who lie in wait [[H8104]] for my life [[H5315]] conspire, [[H3289]] 
11 saying, [[H559]] “God [[H430]] has forsaken him; [[H5800]] pursue him [[H7291]] and seize him, [[H8610]] for [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] one to rescue him.” [[H5337]] 
12 Be not [[H408]] far [[H7368]] from me, [[H4480]] O God. [[H430]] Hurry, [[H2363]] O my God, [[H430]] to help me. [[H5833]] 
13 May the accusers [[H7853]] of my soul [[H5315]] be ashamed [[H954]] [and] consumed; [[H3615]] may those who seek [[H1245]] my harm [[H7451]] be covered [[H5844]] with scorn [[H2781]] and disgrace. [[H3639]] 
14 But I [[H589]] will always [[H8548]] hope [[H3176]] and will praise [[H8416]] You more [[H3254]] and [[H5921]] more. [[H3605]] 
15 My mouth [[H6310]] will declare [[H5608]] Your righteousness [[H6666]] and Your salvation [[H8668]] all day long, [[H3605]] though [[H3588]] I cannot [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] their full measure. [[H5615]] 
16 I will enter [[H935]] in the strength [[H1369]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD; [[H3069]] I will proclaim [[H2142]] Your righteousness— [[H6666]] Yours alone. [[H905]] 
17 O God, [[H430]] You have taught me [[H3925]] from my youth, [[H5271]] and to this day [[H5704]] I proclaim [[H5046]] Your marvelous deeds. [[H6381]] 
18 Even [[H1571]] when I am old [[H2209]] and gray, [[H7872]] do not [[H408]] forsake me, [[H5800]] O God, [[H430]] until [[H5704]] I proclaim [[H5046]] Your power [[H2220]] to the next generation, [[H1755]] Your might [[H1369]] to all [[H3605]] who are to come. [[H935]] 
19 Your righteousness [[H6666]] [reaches] to [[H5704]] the heavens, [[H4791]] O God, [[H430]] You who [[H834]] have done [[H6213]] great things. [[H1419]] Who, [[H4310]] O God, [[H430]] is like You? [[H3644]] 
20 Though you [[H834]] have shown me [[H7200]] many [[H7227]] troubles [[H6869]] and misfortunes, [[H7451]] You will revive me [[H2421]] once again. [[H7725]] Even from the depths [[H8415]] of the earth [[H776]] You will bring me [[H5927]] back up. [[H7725]] 
21 You will increase [[H7235]] my honor [[H1420]] and comfort [[H5162]] me once again. [[H5437]] 
22 So [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will praise You [[H3034]] with the harp [[H3627]] for Your faithfulness, [[H571]] O my God; [[H430]] I will sing praise [[H2167]] to You  with the lyre, [[H3658]] O Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel. [[H3478]] 
23 My lips [[H8193]] will shout for joy [[H7442]] when [[H3588]] I sing praise [[H2167]] to You,  along with my soul [[H5315]] which You have redeemed. [[H6299]] 
24 My tongue [[H3956]] will indeed proclaim [[H1897]] Your righteousness [[H6666]] all day long, [[H3605]] for [[H3588]] those who seek [[H1245]] my harm [[H7451]] are disgraced [[H954]] and [[H3588]] confounded. [[H2659]]
