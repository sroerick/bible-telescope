[[Psalms 110|←]] • [[Psalms 112|→]]
1 Hallelujah! [[H1984]] I will give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] my heart [[H3824]] in the council [[H5475]] of the upright [[H3477]] and in the assembly. [[H5712]] 
2 Great [[H1419]] are the works [[H4639]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] they are pondered [[H1875]] by all [[H3605]] who delight in them. [[H2656]] 
3 Splendid [[H1935]] and majestic [[H1926]] is His work; [[H6467]] His righteousness [[H6666]] endures [[H5975]] forever. [[H5703]] 
4 He has caused [[H6213]] His wonders [[H6381]] to be remembered; [[H2143]] the LORD [[H3068]] is gracious [[H2587]] and compassionate. [[H7349]] 
5 He provides [[H5414]] food [[H2964]] to those who fear Him; [[H3373]] He remembers [[H2142]] His covenant [[H1285]] forever. [[H5769]] 
6 He has shown [[H5046]] His people [[H5971]] the power [[H3581]] of His works [[H4639]] by giving [[H5414]] them  the inheritance [[H5159]] of the nations. [[H1471]] 
7 The works [[H4639]] of His hands [[H3027]] are truth [[H571]] and justice; [[H4941]] all [[H3605]] His precepts [[H6490]] are trustworthy. [[H539]] 
8 They are upheld [[H5564]] forever [[H5703]] and ever, [[H5769]] enacted [[H6213]] in truth [[H571]] and uprightness. [[H3477]] 
9 He has sent [[H7971]] redemption [[H6304]] to His people; [[H5971]] He has ordained [[H6680]] His covenant [[H1285]] forever; [[H5769]] holy [[H6918]] and awesome [[H3372]] is His name. [[H8034]] 
10 The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is the beginning [[H7225]] of wisdom; [[H2451]] all [[H3605]] who follow [His precepts] [[H6213]] have a rich [[H2896]] understanding. [[H7922]] His praise [[H8416]] endures [[H5975]] forever! [[H5703]]
