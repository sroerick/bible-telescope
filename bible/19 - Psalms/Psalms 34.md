# Psalms 34
[[Psalms 33|←]] • [[Psalms 35|→]]
1 Of David, [[H1732]] when he pretended [[H8138]] to be insane [[H2940]] before [[H6440]] Abimelech, [[H40]] so that [the king] drove him [[H1644]] away. [[H1980]] I will bless [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] at all [[H3605]] times; [[H6256]] His praise [[H8416]] will always [[H8548]] be on my lips. [[H6310]] 
2 My soul [[H5315]] will boast [[H1984]] in the LORD; [[H3068]] let the oppressed [[H6035]] hear [[H8085]] and rejoice. [[H8055]] 
3 Magnify [[H1431]] the LORD [[H3068]] with me; [[H854]] let us exalt [[H7311]] His name [[H8034]] together. [[H3162]] 
4 I sought [[H1875]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He answered me; [[H6030]] He delivered [[H5337]] me from all [[H3605]] my fears. [[H4035]] 
5 Those who look [[H5027]] to Him [[H413]] are radiant with joy; [[H5102]] their faces [[H6440]] shall never [[H408]] be ashamed. [[H2659]] 
6 This [[H2088]] poor [[H6041]] man called out, [[H7121]] and the LORD [[H3068]] heard him; [[H8085]] He saved him [[H3467]] from all [[H3605]] his troubles. [[H6869]] 
7 The angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] encamps [[H2583]] around [[H5439]] those who fear Him, [[H3373]] and he delivers them. [[H2502]] 
8 Taste [[H2938]] and see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is good; [[H2896]] blessed [[H835]] is the man [[H1397]] who takes refuge in Him! [[H2620]] 
9 Fear [[H3372]] the LORD, [[H3068]] you His saints, [[H6918]] for [[H3588]] those who fear [[H3373]] Him lack [[H4270]] nothing. [[H369]] 
10 Young lions [[H3715]] go lacking [[H7326]] and hungry, [[H7456]] but those who seek [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3068]] lack [[H2637]] no [[H3808]] good thing. [[H2896]] 
11 Come, [[H1980]] children, [[H1121]] listen to me; [[H8085]] I will teach [[H3925]] you the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 Who [[H4310]] is the man [[H376]] who delights in [[H2655]] life, [[H2416]] who desires [[H157]] to see [many] [[H7200]] good [[H2896]] days? [[H3117]] 
13 Keep [[H5341]] your tongue [[H3956]] from evil [[H7451]] and your lips [[H8193]] from deceitful [[H4820]] speech. [[H1696]] 
14 Turn away [[H5493]] from evil [[H7451]] and do [[H6213]] good; [[H2896]] seek [[H1245]] peace [[H7965]] and pursue it. [[H7291]] 
15 The eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] are on [[H413]] the righteous, [[H6662]] and His ears [[H241]] are inclined [[H413]] to their cry. [[H7775]] 
16 [But] the face [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is against [[H6213]] those who do evil, [[H7451]] to sever [[H3772]] their memory [[H2143]] from the earth. [[H776]] 
17 The righteous cry out, [[H6817]] and the LORD [[H3068]] hears; [[H8085]] He delivers them [[H5337]] from all [[H3605]] their troubles. [[H6869]] 
18 The LORD [[H3068]] is near to [[H7138]] the brokenhearted; [[H7665]] He saves [[H3467]] the contrite [[H1793]] in spirit. [[H7307]] 
19 Many [[H7227]] [are] the afflictions [[H7451]] of the righteous, [[H6662]] but the LORD [[H3068]] delivers him [[H5337]] from them all. [[H3605]] 
20 He protects [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] his bones; [[H6106]] not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of them [[H2007]] will be broken. [[H7665]] 
21 Evil [[H7451]] {will} slay [[H4191]] the wicked, [[H7563]] and the haters [[H8130]] of the righteous [[H6662]] will be condemned. [[H816]] 
22 The LORD [[H3068]] redeems [[H6299]] His servants, [[H5650]] and [[H3605]] none [[H3808]] who take refuge [[H2620]] in Him  will be condemned. [[H816]]
