# Psalms 35
[[Psalms 34|←]] • [[Psalms 36|→]]
1 Of David. [[H1732]] Contend [[H7378]] with my opponents, [[H3401]] O LORD; [[H3068]] fight against [[H3898]] those who battle me. [[H3898]] 
2 Take up [[H2388]] Your shield [[H4043]] and buckler; [[H6793]] arise and come [[H6965]] to my aid. [[H5833]] 
3 Draw [[H7324]] the spear [[H2595]] and javelin [[H5462]] against [[H7125]] my pursuers; [[H7291]] say [[H559]] to my soul: [[H5315]] “I [am] [[H589]] your salvation.” [[H3444]] 
4 May those who seek [[H1245]] my life [[H5315]] be disgraced [[H954]] and put to shame; [[H3637]] may those who plan [[H2803]] to harm me [[H7451]] be driven back [[H5472]] and confounded. [[H2659]] 
5 May they be [[H1961]] like chaff [[H4671]] in [[H6440]] the wind, [[H7307]] as the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] drives them away. [[H1760]] 
6 May their path [[H1870]] be [[H1961]] dark [[H2822]] and slick, [[H2519]] as the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] pursues. [[H7291]] 
7 For [[H3588]] without cause [[H2600]] they laid [[H2934]] their net [[H7568]] for me;  without reason [[H2600]] they dug [[H2658]] a pit [[H7845]] for my soul. [[H5315]] 
8 May ruin [[H7722]] befall them [[H935]] by surprise; [[H3808]] may the net [[H7568]] they hid [[H2934]] ensnare them; [[H3920]] may they fall [[H5307]] into  their own destruction. [[H7722]] 
9 Then my soul [[H5315]] will rejoice [[H1523]] in the LORD [[H3068]] and exult [[H7797]] in His salvation. [[H3444]] 
10 All [[H3605]] my bones [[H6106]] will exclaim, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] is like You, [[H3644]] O LORD, [[H3068]] who delivers [[H5337]] the afflicted [[H6041]] from [[H4480]] the aggressor, [[H2389]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy [[H34]] from the robber?” [[H1497]] 
11 Hostile [[H2555]] witnesses [[H5707]] come forward; [[H6965]] they make charges [[H7592]] I know [[H3045]] nothing {about}. [[H3808]] 
12 They repay [[H7999]] me evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good, [[H2896]] [to] the bereavement [[H7908]] of my soul. [[H5315]] 
13 Yet [[H589]] during their illness, [[H2470]] I put on [[H3830]] sackcloth; [[H8242]] I humbled [[H6031]] myself [[H5315]] with fasting, [[H6685]] but my prayers [[H8605]] returned unanswered. [[H5921]] 
14 I paced about [[H1980]] as for my friend [[H7453]] or brother; [[H251]] I was bowed down [[H7817]] with grief, [[H6937]] like one mourning [[H57]] [for his] mother. [[H517]] 
15 But when I stumbled, [[H6761]] they assembled [[H622]] in glee; [[H8055]] they gathered together [[H622]] against me. [[H5921]] Assailants [[H5222]] I did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] slandered me [[H7167]] without [[H3808]] ceasing. [[H1826]] 
16 Like godless [[H2611]] jesters [[H3934]] at a feast, [[H4580]] they gnashed [[H2786]] their teeth [[H8127]] at me. [[H5921]] 
17 How long, [[H4100]] O Lord, [[H136]] will You look on? [[H7200]] Rescue [[H7725]] my soul [[H5315]] from their ravages, [[H7722]] my precious life [[H3173]] from these lions. [[H3715]] 
18 Then I will give You thanks [[H3034]] in the great [[H7227]] assembly; [[H6951]] I will praise You [[H1984]] among many [[H6099]] people. [[H5971]] 
19 Let not [[H408]] my enemies [[H341]] gloat over me [[H8055]] without cause, [[H8267]] or those who hate me [[H8130]] without reason [[H2600]] wink in malice. [[H7169]] 
20 For [[H3588]] they do not [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] peace, [[H7965]] but devise [[H2803]] deceitful [[H4820]] schemes [[H1697]] against [[H5921]] those who live quietly [[H7282]] in the land. [[H776]] 
21 They gape [[H6310]] at me [[H5921]] and say, [[H559]] “Aha, [[H1889]] aha! [[H1889]] Our eyes [[H5869]] have seen!” [[H7200]] 
22 O LORD, [[H3068]] You have seen it, [[H7200]] do not [[H408]] be silent. [[H2790]] O Lord, [[H136]] be not [[H408]] far [[H7368]] from me. [[H4480]] 
23 Awake [[H5782]] and rise [[H6974]] to my defense, [[H4941]] to my cause, [[H7379]] my God [[H430]] and my Lord! [[H136]] 
24 Vindicate me [[H8199]] by Your righteousness, [[H6664]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] and do not let them [[H408]] gloat [[H8055]] over me.  
25 Let them not [[H408]] say [[H559]] in their hearts, [[H3820]] “Aha, [[H1889]] just what we wanted!” [[H5315]] Let them not [[H408]] say, [[H559]] “We have swallowed him up!” [[H1104]] 
26 May those who gloat [[H8056]] in my distress [[H7451]] be ashamed [[H954]] and confounded; [[H2659]] may those who exalt themselves [[H1431]] over me [[H5921]] be clothed [[H3847]] in shame [[H1322]] and reproach. [[H3639]] 
27 May those who favor [[H2655]] my vindication [[H6664]] shout for joy [[H7442]] and gladness; [[H8055]] may they always [[H8548]] say, [[H559]] “Exalted be [[H1431]] the LORD [[H3068]] who delights [[H2655]] in His servant’s [[H5650]] well-being.” [[H7965]] 
28 Then my tongue [[H3956]] will proclaim [[H1897]] Your righteousness [[H6664]] [and] Your praises [[H8416]] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]]
