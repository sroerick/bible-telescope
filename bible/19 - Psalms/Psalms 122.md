# Psalms 122
[[Psalms 121|←]] • [[Psalms 123|→]]
1 A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] Of David. [[H1732]] I was glad [[H8055]] when they said [[H559]] to me,  “Let us go [[H1980]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
2 Our feet [[H7272]] are standing [[H5975]] in your gates, [[H8179]] O Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
3 Jerusalem [[H3389]] is built up [[H1129]] as a city [[H5892]] united [[H2266]] together, [[H3162]] 
4 where [[H8033]] the tribes [[H7626]] go up, [[H5927]] the tribes [[H7626]] of the LORD, [[H3050]] as a testimony [[H5715]] for Israel, [[H3478]] to give thanks [[H3034]] to the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 For [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] the thrones [[H3678]] of judgment [[H4941]] stand, [[H3427]] the thrones [[H3678]] of the house [[H1004]] of David. [[H1732]] 
6 Pray [[H7592]] for the peace [[H7965]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] “May those who love you [[H157]] prosper. [[H7951]] 
7 May there be [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] within your walls, [[H2426]] [and] prosperity [[H7962]] inside your fortresses.” [[H759]] 
8 For the sake [[H4616]] of my brothers [[H251]] and friends, [[H7453]] I will say, [[H1696]] “Peace [[H7965]] [be] within you.”  
9 For the sake [[H4616]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] I will seek [[H1245]] your prosperity. [[H2896]]
