# Psalms 78
[[Psalms 77|←]] • [[Psalms 79|→]]
1 A Maskil [[H4905]] of Asaph. [[H623]] Give ear, [[H238]] O my people, [[H5971]] to my instruction; [[H8451]] listen [[H5186]] to the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]] 
2 I will open [[H6605]] my mouth [[H6310]] in parables; [[H4912]] I will utter [[H5042]] things hidden [[H2420]] from [[H4480]] of old, [[H6924]] 
3 that [[H834]] we have heard [[H8085]] and known [[H3045]] and our fathers [[H1]] have relayed [[H5608]] to us.  
4 We will not [[H3808]] hide [[H3582]] [them] from their children, [[H1121]] but will declare [[H5608]] to the next [[H314]] generation [[H1755]] the praises [[H8416]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and His might, [[H5807]] and the wonders [[H6381]] He has performed. [[H6213]] 
5 For He established [[H6965]] a testimony [[H5715]] in Jacob [[H3290]] and appointed [[H7760]] a law [[H8451]] in Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] He commanded [[H6680]] our fathers [[H1]] to teach [[H3045]] to their children, [[H1121]] 
6 that [[H4616]] the coming [[H314]] generation [[H1755]] might know— [[H3045]] even children [[H1121]] yet to be born— [[H3205]] to arise [[H6965]] and tell [[H5608]] their children, [[H1121]] 
7 that they should put [[H7760]] their confidence [[H3689]] in God, [[H430]] not [[H3808]] forgetting [[H7911]] [His] [[H410]] works, [[H4611]] but keeping [[H5341]] His commandments. [[H4687]] 
8 Then they will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] like their fathers, [[H1]] a stubborn [[H5637]] and rebellious [[H4784]] generation, [[H1755]] whose heart [[H3820]] was not [[H3808]] loyal, [[H3559]] whose spirit [[H7307]] was not [[H3808]] faithful [[H539]] to [[H854]] God. [[H410]] 
9 The archers [[H5401]] of Ephraim [[H669]] turned back [[H2015]] on the day [[H3117]] of battle. [[H7128]] 
10 They did not [[H3808]] keep [[H8104]] God’s [[H430]] covenant [[H1285]] and refused [[H3985]] to live [[H1980]] by His law. [[H8451]] 
11 They forgot [[H7911]] what He had done, [[H5949]] the wonders [[H6381]] He had shown them. [[H7200]] 
12 He worked [[H6213]] wonders [[H6382]] before [[H5048]] their fathers [[H1]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] in the region [[H7704]] of Zoan. [[H6814]] 
13 He split [[H1234]] the sea [[H3220]] and brought them through; [[H5674]] He set [[H5324]] the waters {upright} [[H4325]] like [[H3644]] a wall. [[H5067]] 
14 He led [[H5148]] them with a cloud [[H6051]] by day [[H3119]] and with a light [[H216]] of fire [[H784]] all [[H3605]] night. [[H3915]] 
15 He split [[H1234]] the rocks [[H6697]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] and gave [them] drink [[H8248]] as abundant [[H7227]] as the seas. [[H8415]] 
16 He brought [[H3318]] streams [[H5140]] from the stone [[H5553]] and made water [[H4325]] flow down [[H3381]] like rivers. [[H5104]] 
17 But they continued [[H3254]] to sin against Him, [[H2398]] rebelling [[H4784]] in the desert [[H6723]] against the Most High. [[H5945]] 
18 They willfully [[H3824]] tested [[H5254]] God [[H410]] by demanding [[H7592]] the food [[H400]] they craved. [[H5315]] 
19 They spoke [[H1696]] against God, [[H430]] saying, [[H559]] “Can [[H3201]] God [[H410]] really prepare [[H6186]] a table [[H7979]] in the wilderness? [[H4057]] 
20 When [[H2005]] He struck [[H5221]] the rock, [[H6697]] water [[H4325]] gushed out [[H2100]] and torrents [[H5158]] overflowed. [[H7857]] But can [[H3201]] He also [[H1571]] give [[H5414]] bread [[H3899]] or [[H518]] supply [[H3559]] His people [[H5971]] with meat?” [[H7607]] 
21 Therefore [[H3651]] the LORD [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] and was full of wrath; [[H5674]] so a fire [[H784]] was kindled [[H5400]] against Jacob, [[H3290]] and [[H1571]] His anger [[H639]] flared [[H5927]] against Israel [[H3478]] 
22 because [[H3588]] they did not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] God [[H430]] or rely [[H982]] on His salvation. [[H3444]] 
23 Yet He commanded [[H6680]] the clouds [[H7834]] above [[H4605]] and opened [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] of the heavens. [[H8064]] 
24 He rained down [[H4305]] manna [[H4478]] for them [[H5921]] to eat; [[H398]] He gave [[H5414]] them  grain [[H1715]] from heaven. [[H8064]] 
25 Man [[H376]] ate [[H398]] the bread [[H3899]] of angels; [[H47]] He sent [[H7971]] them [[H1992]] food [[H6720]] in abundance. [[H7648]] 
26 He stirred [[H5265]] the east wind [[H6921]] from the heavens [[H8064]] and drove [[H5090]] the south wind [[H8486]] by His might. [[H5797]] 
27 He rained [[H4305]] meat [[H7607]] on them [[H5921]] like dust, [[H6083]] and winged [[H3671]] birds [[H5775]] like the sand [[H2344]] of the sea. [[H3220]] 
28 He felled them [[H5307]] in the midst [[H7130]] of their camp, [[H4264]] all around [[H5439]] their dwellings. [[H4908]] 
29 So they ate [[H398]] and were well [[H3966]] filled, [[H7646]] for He gave [[H935]] them [[H1992]] what they craved. [[H8378]] 
30 Yet [[H3808]] before they had filled [[H2114]] their desire, [[H8378]] with the food [[H400]] still [[H5750]] in their mouths, [[H6310]] 
31 God’s [[H430]] anger [[H639]] flared against them, [[H5927]] and He put to death [[H2026]] their strongest [[H4924]] and subdued [[H3766]] the young men [[H970]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
32 In spite of all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] they kept on sinning; [[H2398]] despite [[H5750]] His wonderful works, [[H6381]] they did not [[H3808]] believe. [[H539]] 
33 So He ended [[H3615]] their days [[H3117]] in futility, [[H1892]] and their years [[H8141]] in sudden terror. [[H928]] 
34 When [[H518]] He slew them, [[H2026]] they would seek Him; [[H1875]] they repented [[H7725]] and searched for [[H7836]] God. [[H410]] 
35 And they remembered [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] God [[H430]] was their rock, [[H6697]] that God [[H410]] Most High [[H5945]] was their Redeemer. [[H1350]] 
36 But they deceived [[H6601]] Him with their mouths, [[H6310]] and lied [[H3576]] to Him  with their tongues. [[H3956]] 
37 Their hearts [[H3820]] were disloyal [[H3808]] to Him, [[H5973]] and they were unfaithful [[H3808]] to His covenant. [[H1285]] 
38 Yet He [[H1931]] was compassionate; [[H7349]] He forgave [[H3722]] [their] iniquity [[H5771]] and did not [[H3808]] destroy them. [[H7843]] He often [[H7235]] restrained His anger [[H639]] and did not [[H3808]] unleash [[H5782]] His full wrath. [[H2534]] 
39 He remembered [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] were but flesh, [[H1320]] a passing [[H1980]] breeze [[H7307]] that does not [[H3808]] return. [[H7725]] 
40 How often [[H4100]] they disobeyed Him [[H4784]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] and grieved Him [[H6087]] in the desert. [[H3452]] 
41 Again and again [[H7725]] they tested [[H5254]] God [[H410]] and provoked [[H8428]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel. [[H3478]] 
42 They did not [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] His power— [[H3027]] the day [[H3117]] He redeemed [[H6299]] them from [[H4480]] the adversary, [[H6862]] 
43 when [[H834]] He performed [[H7760]] His signs [[H226]] in Egypt [[H4714]] and His wonders [[H4159]] in the fields [[H7704]] of Zoan. [[H6814]] 
44 He turned [[H2015]] their rivers [[H2975]] to blood, [[H1818]] and from their streams [[H5140]] they could not [[H1077]] drink. [[H8354]] 
45 He sent [[H7971]] swarms of flies [[H6157]] that devoured them, [[H398]] and frogs [[H6854]] that devastated them. [[H7843]] 
46 He gave [[H5414]] their crops [[H2981]] to the grasshopper, [[H2625]] the fruit of their labor [[H3018]] to the locust. [[H697]] 
47 He killed [[H2026]] their vines [[H1612]] with hailstones [[H1259]] and their sycamore-figs [[H8256]] with sleet. [[H2602]] 
48 He abandoned [[H5462]] their cattle [[H1165]] to the hail [[H1259]] and their livestock [[H4735]] to bolts of lightning. [[H7565]] 
49 He unleashed [[H7971]] His fury [[H2740]] against them, [[H639]] wrath, [[H5678]] indignation, [[H2195]] and calamity— [[H6869]] a band [[H4917]] of destroying [[H7451]] angels. [[H4397]] 
50 He cleared [[H6424]] a path [[H5410]] for His anger; [[H639]] He did not [[H3808]] spare [[H2820]] them [[H5315]] from death [[H4194]] but delivered [[H5462]] their lives [[H2416]] to the plague. [[H1698]] 
51 He struck [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the virility [[H202]] in the tents [[H168]] of Ham. [[H2526]] 
52 He led out His people [[H5971]] like sheep [[H6629]] and guided [[H5090]] them like a flock [[H5739]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
53 He led them [[H5148]] safely, [[H983]] so they did not [[H3808]] fear, [[H6342]] but [[H853]] the sea [[H3220]] engulfed [[H3680]] their enemies. [[H341]] 
54 He brought [[H935]] them to [[H413]] His holy [[H6944]] land, [[H1366]] to the hill country [[H2022]] His right hand [[H3225]] had acquired. [[H7069]] 
55 He drove out [[H1644]] nations [[H1471]] before them [[H6440]] and apportioned [[H5307]] their inheritance; [[H5159]] He settled [[H7931]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] in their tents. [[H168]] 
56 But they tested [[H5254]] and disobeyed [[H4784]] God [[H430]] Most High, [[H5945]] for they did not [[H3808]] keep [[H8104]] His decrees. [[H5713]] 
57 They turned back [[H5472]] and were faithless [[H898]] like their fathers, [[H1]] twisted [[H2015]] like a faulty [[H7423]] bow. [[H7198]] 
58 They enraged Him [[H3707]] with their high places [[H1116]] and provoked His jealousy [[H7065]] with their idols. [[H6456]] 
59 On hearing it, [[H8085]] God [[H430]] was furious [[H5674]] and rejected [[H3988]] Israel [[H3478]] completely. [[H3966]] 
60 He abandoned [[H5203]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of Shiloh, [[H7887]] the tent [[H168]] He had pitched [[H7931]] among men. [[H120]] 
61 He delivered [[H5414]] His strength [[H5797]] to captivity, [[H7628]] and His splendor [[H8597]] to the hand [[H3027]] of the adversary. [[H6862]] 
62 He surrendered [[H5462]] His people [[H5971]] to the sword [[H2719]] because He was enraged [[H5674]] by His heritage. [[H5159]] 
63 Fire [[H784]] consumed [[H398]] His young men, [[H970]] and their maidens [[H1330]] were left without [[H3808]] wedding songs. [[H1984]] 
64 His priests [[H3548]] fell [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] but His widows [[H490]] could not [[H3808]] lament. [[H1058]] 
65 Then the Lord [[H136]] awoke [[H3364]] as from sleep, [[H3463]] like a warrior [[H1368]] overcome [[H7442]] by wine. [[H3196]] 
66 He beat [[H5221]] back [[H268]] His foes; [[H6862]] He put them to [[H5414]] everlasting [[H5769]] shame. [[H2781]] 
67 He rejected [[H3988]] the tent [[H168]] of Joseph [[H3130]] and refused [[H3808]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Ephraim. [[H669]] 
68 But He chose [[H977]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Mount [[H2022]] Zion, [[H6726]] which [[H834]] He loved. [[H157]] 
69 He built [[H1129]] His sanctuary [[H4720]] like [[H3644]] the heights, [[H7311]] like the earth [[H776]] He has established [[H3245]] forever. [[H5769]] 
70 He chose [[H977]] David [[H1732]] His servant [[H5650]] and took him [[H3947]] from the sheepfolds; [[H4356]] 
71 from tending [[H310]] the ewes [[H5763]] He brought him [[H935]] to be shepherd [[H7462]] of His people [[H5971]] Jacob, [[H3290]] of Israel [[H3478]] His inheritance. [[H5159]] 
72 So [David] shepherded them [[H7462]] with integrity [[H8537]] of heart [[H3824]] and guided them [[H5148]] with skillful [[H8394]] hands. [[H3709]]
