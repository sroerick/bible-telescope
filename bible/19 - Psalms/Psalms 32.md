# Psalms 32
[[Psalms 31|←]] • [[Psalms 33|→]]
1 Of David. [[H1732]] A Maskil. [[H4905]] Blessed is he [[H835]] whose transgressions [[H6588]] are forgiven, [[H5375]] whose sins [[H2401]] are covered. [[H3680]] 
2 Blessed [[H835]] is the man [[H120]] whose sin [[H5771]] the LORD [[H3068]] does not [[H3808]] count [[H2803]] against him,  in whose spirit [[H7307]] there is no [[H369]] deceit. [[H7423]] 
3 When [[H3588]] I kept silent, [[H2790]] my bones [[H6106]] became brittle [[H1086]] from my groaning [[H7581]] all day long. [[H3605]] 
4 For [[H3588]] day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] Your hand [[H3027]] was heavy [[H3513]] upon me; [[H5921]] my strength [[H3955]] was drained [[H2015]] as in the summer [[H7019]] heat. [[H2725]] Selah [[H5542]] 
5 Then I acknowledged [[H3045]] my sin to You [[H2403]] and did not [[H3808]] hide [[H3680]] my iniquity. [[H5771]] I said, [[H559]] “I will confess [[H3034]] my transgressions [[H6588]] to the LORD,” [[H3068]] and You [[H859]] forgave [[H5375]] the guilt [[H5771]] of my sin. [[H2403]] Selah [[H5542]] 
6 Therefore [[H5921]] let all [[H3605]] the godly [[H2623]] pray [[H6419]] to You [[H413]] while [[H6256]] You may be found. [[H4672]] Surely [[H7535]] when great [[H7227]] waters [[H7858]] rise, [[H4325]] they will not [[H3808]] come near. [[H5060]] 
7 You [[H859]] are my hiding place. [[H5643]] You protect me [[H5341]] from trouble; [[H6862]] You surround me [[H5437]] with songs [[H7438]] of deliverance. [[H6405]] Selah [[H5542]] 
8 I will instruct you [[H7919]] and teach [[H3384]] you the way [[H1870]] you should go; [[H1980]] I will give you counsel [[H3289]] [and] watch [[H5869]] over you. [[H5921]] 
9 Do not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] like the horse [[H5483]] or mule, [[H6505]] [which] have no [[H369]] understanding; [[H995]] they must be controlled [[H1102]] with bit [[H4964]] and bridle [[H7448]] [to make] [[H1077]] them come [[H7126]] to you. [[H413]] 
10 Many [[H7227]] are the sorrows [[H4341]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] but loving devotion [[H2617]] surrounds [[H5437]] him who trusts [[H982]] in the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 Be glad [[H8055]] in the LORD [[H3068]] and rejoice, [[H1523]] O righteous; [[H6662]] shout for joy, [[H7442]] all [[H3605]] you upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]
