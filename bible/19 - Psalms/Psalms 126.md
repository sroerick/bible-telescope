# Psalms 126
[[Psalms 125|←]] • [[Psalms 127|→]]
1 A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] When the LORD [[H3068]] restored [[H7725]] the captives [[H7870]] of Zion, [[H6726]] we were [[H1961]] like dreamers. [[H2492]] 
2 Then [[H227]] our mouths [[H6310]] were filled [[H4390]] with laughter [[H7814]] and our tongues [[H3956]] with shouts of joy. [[H7440]] Then [[H227]] it was proclaimed [[H559]] among the nations, [[H1471]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has done [[H6213]] great [[H1431]] things for [[H5973]] them.” [[H428]] 
3 The LORD [[H3068]] has done [[H6213]] great [[H1431]] things for us; [[H5973]] we are [[H1961]] filled with joy. [[H8056]] 
4 Restore [[H7725]] our captives, [[H7622]] O LORD, [[H3068]] like streams [[H650]] in the Negev. [[H5045]] 
5 Those who sow [[H2232]] in tears [[H1832]] will reap [[H7114]] with shouts of joy. [[H7440]] 
6 He who goes out [[H1980]] weeping, [[H1058]] bearing [[H5375]] a trail [[H4901]] of seed, [[H2233]] will surely return [[H935]] with shouts of joy, [[H7440]] carrying [[H5375]] sheaves [of grain]. [[H485]]
