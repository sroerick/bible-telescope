# Psalms 95
[[Psalms 94|←]] • [[Psalms 96|→]]
1 Come, [[H1980]] let us sing for joy [[H7442]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] let us shout [[H7321]] to the rock [[H6697]] of our salvation! [[H3468]] 
2 Let us enter [[H6923]] His presence [[H6440]] with thanksgiving; [[H8426]] let us make a joyful noise [[H7321]] to Him  in song. [[H2158]] 
3 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is a great [[H1419]] God, [[H410]] a great [[H1419]] King [[H4428]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]] 
4 In [[H834]] His hand [[H3027]] are the depths [[H4278]] of the earth, [[H776]] and the mountain [[H2022]] peaks [[H8443]] belong to Him.  
5 The sea [[H3220]] is His, [[H834]] for He [[H1931]] made it, [[H6213]] and His hands [[H3027]] formed [[H3335]] the dry land. [[H3006]] 
6 O come, [[H935]] let us worship [[H7812]] and bow down; [[H3766]] let us kneel [[H1288]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] our Maker. [[H6213]] 
7 For [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] is our God, [[H430]] and we [[H587]] are the people [[H5971]] of His pasture, [[H4830]] the sheep [[H6629]] under His care. [[H3027]] Today, [[H3117]] if [[H518]] you hear [[H8085]] His voice, [[H6963]] 
8 do not [[H408]] harden [[H7185]] your hearts [[H3824]] as you did at Meribah, [[H4808]] as on that day [[H3117]] at Massah [[H4531]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] 
9 where [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] tested [[H5254]] and tried Me, [[H974]] though [[H1571]] they had seen [[H7200]] My work. [[H6467]] 
10 For forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] I was angry [[H6962]] with that generation, [[H1755]] and I said, [[H559]] “They [[H1992]] are a people [[H5971]] whose hearts [[H3824]] go astray, [[H8582]] and they [[H1992]] have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] My ways.” [[H1870]] 
11 So [[H834]] I swore on oath [[H7650]] in My anger, [[H639]] “They shall never [[H518]] enter [[H935]] My rest.” [[H4496]]
