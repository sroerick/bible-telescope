# Psalms 112
[[Psalms 111|←]] • [[Psalms 113|→]]
1 Hallelujah! [[H1984]] Blessed [[H835]] is the man [[H376]] who fears [[H3372]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who greatly [[H3966]] delights [[H2654]] in His commandments. [[H4687]] 
2 His descendants [[H2233]] will be [[H1961]] mighty [[H1368]] in the land; [[H776]] the generation [[H1755]] of the upright [[H3477]] will be blessed. [[H1288]] 
3 Wealth [[H1952]] and riches [[H6239]] are in his house, [[H1004]] and his righteousness [[H6666]] endures [[H5975]] forever. [[H5703]] 
4 Light [[H216]] dawns [[H2224]] in the darkness [[H2822]] for the upright, [[H3477]] for the one who is gracious, [[H2587]] compassionate, [[H7349]] and righteous. [[H6662]] 
5 It is well [[H2896]] with the man [[H376]] who is generous [[H2603]] and lends freely, [[H3867]] whose affairs [[H1697]] are guided [[H3557]] by justice. [[H4941]] 
6 Surely [[H3588]] he will never [[H5769]] be shaken. [[H4131]] The righteous man [[H6662]] will be [[H1961]] remembered [[H2143]] forever. [[H5769]] 
7 He will not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] bad [[H7451]] news; [[H8052]] his heart [[H3820]] is steadfast, [[H3559]] trusting [[H982]] in the LORD. [[H3068]] 
8 His heart [[H3820]] is assured; [[H5564]] he will not [[H3808]] fear, [[H3372]] until [[H5704]] he looks in triumph [[H7200]] on his foes. [[H6862]] 
9 He has scattered abroad [[H6340]] his gifts [[H5414]] to the poor; [[H34]] his righteousness [[H6666]] endures [[H5975]] forever. [[H5703]] His horn [[H7161]] will be lifted high [[H7311]] in honor. [[H3519]] 
10 The wicked man [[H7563]] will see [[H7200]] and be grieved; [[H3707]] he will gnash [[H2786]] his teeth [[H8127]] and waste away; [[H4549]] the desires [[H8378]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will perish. [[H6]]
