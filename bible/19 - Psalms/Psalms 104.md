# Psalms 104
[[Psalms 103|←]] • [[Psalms 105|→]]
1 Bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] O my soul. [[H5315]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] You are very [[H3966]] great; [[H1431]] You are clothed [[H3847]] with splendor [[H1935]] and majesty. [[H1926]] 
2 He wraps [[H5844]] Himself in light [[H216]] as [with] a garment; [[H8008]] He stretches out [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] like a tent, [[H3407]] 
3 laying the beams [[H7136]] of his chambers [[H5944]] on the waters above, [[H4325]] making [[H7760]] the clouds [[H5645]] His chariot, [[H7398]] walking [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] the wings [[H3671]] of the wind. [[H7307]] 
4 He makes [[H6213]] the winds [[H7307]] His messengers, [[H4397]] flames [[H3857]] of fire [[H784]] His servants. [[H8334]] 
5 He set [[H3254]] the earth [[H776]] on [[H5921]] its foundations, [[H4349]] never [[H1077]] to be moved. [[H4131]] 
6 You covered [[H3680]] it with the deep [[H8415]] like a garment; [[H3830]] the waters [[H4325]] stood [[H5975]] above [[H5921]] the mountains. [[H2022]] 
7 At [[H4480]] Your rebuke [[H1606]] the waters fled; [[H5127]] at [[H4480]] the sound [[H6963]] of Your thunder [[H7482]] they hurried away— [[H2648]] 
8 the mountains [[H2022]] rose [[H5927]] and the valleys [[H1237]] sank [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] You appointed [[H3245]] for them— [[H1992]] 
9 You set [[H7760]] a boundary [[H1366]] they cannot [[H1077]] cross; [[H5674]] they will never [[H1077]] again [[H7725]] cover [[H3680]] the earth. [[H776]] 
10 He sends forth [[H7971]] springs [[H4599]] in the valleys; [[H5158]] they flow [[H1980]] between [[H996]] the mountains. [[H2022]] 
11 They give drink [[H8248]] to every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field; [[H7704]] the wild donkeys [[H6501]] quench [[H7665]] their thirst. [[H6772]] 
12 The birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] nest [[H7931]] beside the springs; [[H5921]] they sing [[H5414]] among [[H996]] the branches. [[H6073]] 
13 He waters [[H8248]] the mountains [[H2022]] from His chambers; [[H5944]] the earth [[H776]] is satisfied [[H7646]] by the fruit [[H6529]] of His works. [[H4639]] 
14 He makes the grass [[H2682]] grow [[H6779]] for the livestock [[H929]] and provides crops [[H6212]] for man [[H120]] to cultivate, [[H5656]] bringing forth [[H3318]] food [[H3899]] from [[H4480]] the earth: [[H776]] 
15 wine [[H3196]] that gladdens [[H8055]] the heart [[H3824]] of man, [[H582]] oil [[H8081]] that makes his face [[H6440]] to shine [[H6670]] and bread [[H3899]] that sustains [[H5582]] [his] [[H582]] heart. [[H3824]] 
16 The trees [[H6086]] of the LORD [[H3068]] have their fill, [[H7646]] the cedars [[H730]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] that [[H834]] He planted, [[H5193]] 
17 where [[H834]] the birds [[H6833]] build their nests; [[H7077]] the stork [[H2624]] makes her home [[H1004]] in the pines. [[H1265]] 
18 The high [[H1364]] mountains [[H2022]] are for the wild goats, [[H3277]] the cliffs [[H5553]] a refuge [[H4268]] for the coneys. [[H8227]] 
19 He made [[H6213]] the moon [[H3394]] to mark the seasons; [[H4150]] the sun [[H8121]] knows [[H3045]] when to set. [[H3996]] 
20 You bring [[H7896]] darkness, [[H2822]] and it becomes [[H1961]] night, [[H3915]] when all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the forest [[H3293]] prowl. [[H7430]] 
21 The young lions [[H3715]] roar [[H7580]] for their prey [[H2964]] and seek [[H1245]] their food [[H400]] from God. [[H410]] 
22 The sun [[H8121]] rises, [[H2224]] and they withdraw; [[H622]] they lie down [[H7257]] in [[H413]] their dens. [[H4585]] 
23 Man [[H120]] goes forth [[H3318]] to his work [[H6467]] and to his labor [[H5656]] until [[H5703]] evening. [[H6153]] 
24 How [[H4100]] many [[H7231]] are Your works, [[H4639]] O LORD! [[H3068]] In wisdom [[H2451]] You have made [[H6213]] them all; [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] is full of [[H4390]] Your creatures. [[H7075]] 
25 Here [[H2088]] is the sea, [[H3220]] vast [[H1419]] and wide, [[H7342]] teeming with creatures [[H7431]] beyond number, [[H369]] living things [[H2416]] both great [[H1419]] and [[H5973]] small. [[H6996]] 
26 There [[H8033]] the ships [[H591]] pass, [[H1980]] and Leviathan, [[H3882]] which [[H2088]] You formed [[H3335]] to frolic there. [[H7832]] 
27 All [creatures] [[H3605]] look [[H7663]] to You [[H413]] to give [them] [[H5414]] their food [[H400]] in due season. [[H6256]] 
28 When You give it [[H5414]] to them, [[H1992]] they gather it up; [[H3950]] when You open [[H6605]] Your hand, [[H3027]] they are satisfied [[H7646]] with good things. [[H2896]] 
29 When You hide [[H5641]] Your face, [[H6440]] they panic; [[H926]] when You take away [[H622]] their breath, [[H7307]] they die [[H1478]] and return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] dust. [[H6083]] 
30 When You send [[H7971]] Your Spirit, [[H7307]] they are created, [[H1254]] and You renew [[H2318]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]] 
31 May the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] endure [[H1961]] forever; [[H5769]] may the LORD [[H3068]] rejoice [[H8055]] in His works. [[H4639]] 
32 He looks [[H5027]] on the earth, [[H776]] and it trembles; [[H7460]] He touches [[H5060]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and they smolder. [[H6225]] 
33 I will sing [[H7891]] to the LORD [[H3068]] all my life; [[H2416]] I will sing praise [[H2167]] to my God [[H430]] while I have my being. [[H5750]] 
34 May my meditation [[H7879]] be pleasing [[H6149]] to Him, [[H5921]] for I [[H595]] rejoice [[H8055]] in the LORD. [[H3068]] 
35 May sinners [[H2400]] vanish [[H8552]] from [[H4480]] the earth [[H776]] and the wicked [[H7563]] be no [[H369]] more. [[H5750]] Bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] O my soul. [[H5315]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
