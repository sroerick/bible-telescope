# Psalms 74
[[Psalms 73|←]] • [[Psalms 75|→]]
1 A Maskil [[H4905]] of Asaph. [[H623]] Why [[H4100]] have You rejected us forever, [[H2186]] O God? [[H430]] Why does Your anger [[H639]] burn [[H6225]] against the sheep [[H6629]] of Your pasture? [[H4830]] 
2 Remember [[H2142]] Your congregation, [[H5712]] which You purchased [[H7069]] long ago [[H6924]] and redeemed [[H1350]] as the tribe [[H7626]] of Your inheritance— [[H5159]] Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] where You dwell. [[H7931]] 
3 Turn [[H7311]] Your steps [[H6471]] to the everlasting [[H5331]] ruins, [[H4876]] to everything [[H3605]] in the sanctuary [[H6944]] the enemy [[H341]] has destroyed. [[H7489]] 
4 Your foes [[H6887]] have roared [[H7580]] within [[H7130]] Your meeting place; [[H4150]] they have unfurled [[H7760]] their banners [[H226]] as signs, [[H226]] 
5 like men [[H3045]] wielding [[H935]] axes, [[H7134]] in a thicket [[H5442]] of trees, [[H6086]] 
6 and smashing [[H1986]] all [[H3162]] the carved work [[H6603]] with hatchets [[H3781]] and picks. [[H3597]] 
7 They have burned [[H7971]] Your sanctuary [[H4720]] {to the ground}; [[H776]] they have defiled [[H2490]] the dwelling place [[H4908]] of Your name. [[H8034]] 
8 They said [[H559]] in their hearts, [[H3820]] “We will crush them [[H3238]] completely.” [[H3162]] They burned down [[H8313]] every [[H3605]] place [[H4150]] where God met us [[H410]] in the land. [[H776]] 
9 There are no [[H3808]] signs [[H226]] for us to see. [[H7200]] There is no [[H369]] longer [[H5750]] any prophet. [[H5030]] And none [[H3808]] of us [[H854]] knows [[H3045]] how long [[H5704]] this will last. [[H4100]] 
10 How long, [[H5704]] O God, [[H430]] will the enemy [[H6862]] taunt You? [[H2778]] Will the foe [[H341]] revile [[H5006]] Your name [[H8034]] forever? [[H5331]] 
11 Why [[H4100]] do You withdraw [[H7725]] Your hand? [[H3027]] Stretch out [[H7130]] Your right hand [[H3225]] and destroy them! [[H3615]] 
12 Yet God [[H430]] [is] my King [[H4428]] from of old, [[H6924]] working [[H6466]] salvation [[H3444]] on [[H7130]] the earth. [[H776]] 
13 You [[H859]] divided [[H6565]] the sea [[H3220]] by Your strength; [[H5797]] You smashed [[H7665]] the heads [[H7218]] of the dragons [[H8577]] of [[H5921]] the sea; [[H4325]] 
14 You [[H859]] crushed [[H7533]] the heads [[H7218]] of Leviathan; [[H3882]] You fed him [[H5414]] to the creatures [[H5971]] of the desert. [[H6728]] 
15 You [[H859]] broke open [[H1234]] the fountain [[H4599]] and the flood; [[H5158]] You [[H859]] dried up [[H3001]] the ever-flowing [[H386]] rivers. [[H5104]] 
16 The day is Yours, [[H3117]] and also [[H637]] the night; [[H3915]] You [[H859]] established [[H3559]] the moon [[H3974]] and the sun. [[H8121]] 
17 You [[H859]] set [[H5324]] all [[H3605]] the boundaries [[H1367]] of the earth; [[H776]] You [[H859]] made [[H3335]] the summer [[H7019]] and winter. [[H2779]] 
18 Remember [[H2142]] how [[H2063]] the enemy [[H341]] has mocked You, [[H2778]] O LORD, [[H3068]] how a foolish [[H5036]] people [[H5971]] has spurned [[H5006]] Your name. [[H8034]] 
19 Do not [[H408]] deliver [[H5414]] the soul [[H5315]] of Your dove [[H8449]] to beasts; [[H2416]] do not [[H408]] forget [[H7911]] the lives [[H2416]] of Your afflicted [[H6041]] forever. [[H5331]] 
20 Consider [[H5027]] Your covenant, [[H1285]] for [[H3588]] haunts [[H4999]] of violence [[H2555]] fill [[H4390]] the dark places [[H4285]] of the land. [[H776]] 
21 Do not [[H408]] let the oppressed [[H1790]] retreat [[H7725]] in shame; [[H3637]] may the poor [[H6041]] and needy [[H34]] praise [[H1984]] Your name. [[H8034]] 
22 Rise up, [[H6965]] O God, [[H430]] defend [[H7378]] Your cause! [[H7379]] Remember [[H2142]] how [[H4480]] the fool [[H5036]] mocks You [[H2781]] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]] 
23 Do not [[H408]] disregard [[H7911]] the clamor [[H6963]] of Your adversaries, [[H6887]] the uproar [[H7588]] of Your enemies [[H6965]] that ascends [[H5927]] continually. [[H8548]]
