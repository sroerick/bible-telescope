# Psalms 19
[[Psalms 18|←]] • [[Psalms 20|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] The heavens [[H8064]] declare [[H5608]] the glory [[H3519]] of God; [[H410]] the skies [[H7549]] proclaim [[H5046]] the work [[H4639]] of His hands. [[H3027]] 
2 Day [[H3117]] after day [[H3117]] they pour forth [[H5042]] speech; [[H562]] night [[H3915]] after night [[H3915]] they reveal [[H2331]] knowledge. [[H1847]] 
3 Without [[H369]] speech [[H562]] or [[H369]] language, [[H1697]] without a sound [[H6963]] to be heard, [[H8085]] 
4 their voice [[H6957]] has gone out [[H3318]] into all [[H3605]] the earth, [[H776]] their words [[H4405]] to the ends [[H7097]] of the world. [[H8398]] In the heavens He has pitched [[H7760]] a tent [[H168]] for the sun [[H8121]] 
5 like a bridegroom [[H2860]] emerging [[H3318]] from his chamber, [[H2646]] like a champion [[H1368]] rejoicing [[H7797]] to run [[H7323]] his course. [[H734]] 
6 It rises [[H4161]] at one end [[H7097]] of the heavens [[H8064]] and runs its circuit [[H8622]] to [[H5921]] the other; [[H7098]] nothing [[H369]] is deprived [[H5641]] of its warmth. [[H2535]] 
7 The law [[H8451]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is perfect, [[H8549]] reviving [[H7725]] the soul; [[H5315]] the testimony [[H5715]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is trustworthy, [[H539]] making wise [[H2449]] the simple. [[H6612]] 
8 The precepts [[H6490]] of the LORD [[H3068]] are right, [[H3477]] bringing joy [[H8055]] to the heart; [[H3820]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] are radiant, [[H1249]] giving light [[H215]] to the eyes. [[H5869]] 
9 The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is pure, [[H2889]] enduring forever; [[H5975]] the judgments [[H4941]] of the LORD [[H3068]] are true, [[H571]] being altogether [[H3162]] righteous. [[H6663]] 
10 They are more precious [[H2530]] than gold, [[H2091]] than much [[H7227]] pure gold; [[H6337]] they are sweeter [[H4966]] than honey, [[H1706]] than honey [[H6688]] from the comb. [[H5317]] 
11 By them indeed [[H1571]] Your servant [[H5650]] is warned; [[H2094]] in  keeping them [[H8104]] [is] great [[H7227]] reward. [[H6118]] 
12 Who [[H4310]] can discern [[H995]] his own errors? [[H7691]] Cleanse me [[H5352]] from my hidden faults. [[H5641]] 
13 Keep [[H2820]] Your servant [[H5650]] also [[H1571]] from willful sins; [[H2086]] may they not [[H408]] rule over me. [[H4910]] Then [[H227]] I will be blameless [[H8552]] and cleansed [[H5352]] of great [[H7227]] transgression. [[H6588]] 
14 May the words [[H561]] of my mouth [[H6310]] and the meditation [[H1902]] of my heart [[H3820]] be [[H1961]] pleasing [[H7522]] in Your sight, [[H6440]] O LORD, [[H3068]] my Rock [[H6697]] and my Redeemer. [[H1350]]
