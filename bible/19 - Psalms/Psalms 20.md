1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] May the LORD [[H3068]] answer you [[H6030]] in the day [[H3117]] of trouble; [[H6869]] may the name [[H8034]] of the God [[H430]] of Jacob [[H3290]] protect you. [[H7682]] 
2 May He send you [[H7971]] help [[H5828]] from the sanctuary [[H6944]] and sustain you [[H5582]] from Zion. [[H6726]] 
3 May He remember [[H2142]] all [[H3605]] your gifts [[H4503]] and look favorably on [[H1878]] your burnt offerings. [[H5930]] Selah [[H5542]] 
4 May He give [[H5414]] you  the desires of your heart [[H3824]] and make [[H4390]] all your [[H3605]] plans {succeed}. [[H6098]] 
5 May we shout for joy [[H7442]] at your victory [[H3444]] and raise a banner [[H1713]] in the name [[H8034]] of our God. [[H430]] May the LORD [[H3068]] sanction [[H4390]] all [[H3605]] your petitions. [[H4862]] 
6 Now [[H6258]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] saves [[H3467]] His anointed; [[H4899]] He answers him [[H6030]] from His holy [[H6944]] heaven [[H8064]] with the saving [[H3468]] power [[H1369]] of His right hand. [[H3225]] 
7 Some [[H428]] [trust] in chariots [[H7393]] and others [[H428]] in horses, [[H5483]] but we [[H587]] trust [[H2142]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]] 
8 They [[H1992]] collapse [[H3766]] and fall, [[H5307]] but we [[H587]] rise up [[H6965]] and stand firm. [[H5749]] 
9 O LORD, [[H3068]] deliver [[H3467]] the king. [[H4428]] Answer us [[H6030]] on the day [[H3117]] we call. [[H7121]]
