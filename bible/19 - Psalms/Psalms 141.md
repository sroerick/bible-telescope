# Psalms 141
[[Psalms 140|←]] • [[Psalms 142|→]]
1 A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] I call upon You, [[H7121]] O LORD; [[H3068]] come quickly [[H2363]] to me.  Hear [[H238]] my voice [[H6963]] when I call [[H7121]] to You.  
2 May my prayer [[H8605]] be set [[H3559]] before You [[H6440]] like incense, [[H7004]] my uplifted [[H4864]] hands [[H3709]] like the evening [[H6153]] offering. [[H4503]] 
3 Set [[H7896]] a guard, [[H8108]] O LORD, [[H3068]] over my mouth; [[H6310]] keep watch [[H5341]] at [[H5921]] the door [[H1817]] of my lips. [[H8193]] 
4 Do not let [[H408]] my heart [[H3820]] be drawn [[H5186]] to any evil [[H7451]] thing [[H1697]] or take part [[H5953]] in works [[H5949]] of wickedness [[H7562]] with [[H854]] men [[H582]] who do [[H6466]] iniquity; [[H205]] let me not [[H1077]] feast [[H3898]] on their delicacies. [[H4516]] 
5 Let the righteous man [[H6662]] strike me; [[H1986]] let his rebuke [[H3198]] be an act of loving devotion. [[H2617]] It is oil [[H8081]] for my head; [[H7218]] let me not [[H408]] refuse it. [[H5106]] For [[H3588]] my prayer is ever against [[H8605]] the deeds of the wicked. [[H7451]] 
6 When their rulers [[H8199]] are thrown [[H8058]] from [[H3027]] the cliffs, [[H5553]] the people will listen [[H8085]] to my words, [[H561]] for [[H3588]] they are pleasant. [[H5276]] 
7 As when [[H3644]] one plows [[H6398]] and breaks up [[H1234]] the soil, [[H776]] so our bones [[H6106]] have been scattered [[H6340]] at the mouth [[H6310]] of Sheol. [[H7585]] 
8 But [[H3588]] my eyes [[H5869]] are fixed on You, [[H413]] O GOD, [[H3068]] the Lord. [[H136]] In You  I seek refuge; [[H2620]] do not [[H408]] leave [[H6168]] my soul {defenseless}. [[H5315]] 
9 Keep [[H8104]] me from [[H3027]] the snares [[H6341]] they have laid for me, [[H3369]] and from the lures [[H4170]] of the evildoers. [[H6466]] 
10 Let the wicked [[H7563]] fall [[H5307]] into their own nets, [[H4364]] while [[H5704]] I [[H595]] pass by in safety. [[H5674]]
