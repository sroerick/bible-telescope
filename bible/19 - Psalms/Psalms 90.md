# Psalms 90
[[Psalms 89|←]] • [[Psalms 91|→]]
1 A prayer [[H8605]] of Moses, [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] Lord, [[H136]] You [[H859]] have been [[H1961]] our dwelling place [[H4583]] through all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]] 
2 Before [[H2962]] the mountains [[H2022]] were born, [[H3205]] or You brought forth [[H2342]] the earth [[H776]] and world, [[H8398]] from everlasting [[H5769]] to everlasting, [[H5769]] You [[H859]] are God. [[H410]] 
3 You return [[H7725]] man [[H582]] to [[H5704]] dust [[H1793]] and say, [[H559]] “Return, [[H7725]] O sons [[H1121]] of mortals.” [[H120]] 
4 For [[H3588]] in Your sight [[H5869]] a thousand [[H505]] years [[H8141]] are but [[H3117]] a day [[H865]] that [[H3588]] passes, [[H5674]] or a watch [[H821]] of the night. [[H3915]] 
5 You whisk them away [[H2229]] in their sleep; [[H8142]] they are [[H1961]] like the new grass [[H2682]] of the morning— [[H1242]] 
6 in the morning [[H1242]] it springs up [[H6692]] new; [[H2498]] by evening [[H6153]] it fades [[H4135]] and withers. [[H3001]] 
7 For [[H3588]] we are consumed [[H3615]] by Your anger [[H639]] and terrified [[H926]] by Your wrath. [[H2534]] 
8 You have set [[H7896]] our iniquities [[H5771]] before You, [[H5048]] our secret [sins] [[H5956]] in the light [[H3974]] of Your presence. [[H6440]] 
9 For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] our days [[H3117]] decline [[H6437]] in Your fury; [[H5678]] we finish [[H3615]] our years [[H8141]] with [[H3644]] a sigh. [[H1899]] 
10 The length of our days [[H3117]] is seventy [[H7657]] years— [[H8141]] or eighty [[H8084]] if we are strong— [[H518]] yet their pride [[H7296]] is but labor [[H5999]] and sorrow, [[H205]] for [[H3588]] they quickly [[H2440]] pass, [[H1468]] and we fly away. [[H5774]] 
11 Who [[H4310]] knows [[H3045]] the power [[H5797]] of Your anger? [[H639]] Your wrath [[H5678]] matches the fear You are due. [[H3374]] 
12 So [[H3651]] teach [[H3045]] us to number [[H4487]] our days, [[H3117]] that we may present [[H935]] a heart [[H3824]] of wisdom. [[H2451]] 
13 Return, [[H7725]] O LORD! [[H3068]] How long will it be? [[H5704]] Have compassion [[H5162]] on [[H5921]] Your servants. [[H5650]] 
14 Satisfy [[H7646]] us in the morning [[H1242]] with Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] that we may sing for joy [[H7442]] and be glad [[H8055]] all [[H3605]] our days. [[H3117]] 
15 Make us glad [[H8055]] for as many days [[H3117]] as You have afflicted us, [[H6031]] for as many years [[H8141]] as we have seen [[H7200]] evil. [[H7451]] 
16 May Your work [[H6467]] be shown [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Your servants, [[H5650]] and Your splendor [[H1926]] to [[H5921]] their children. [[H1121]] 
17 May the favor [[H5278]] of the Lord [[H136]] our God [[H430]] rest [[H1961]] upon us; [[H5921]] establish [[H3559]] for us [[H5921]] the work [[H4639]] of our hands— [[H3027]] establish [[H3559]] the work [[H4639]] of our hands! [[H3027]]
