[[Psalms 134|←]] • [[Psalms 136|→]]
1 Hallelujah! [[H1984]] Praise [[H1984]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Give praise, [[H1984]] O servants [[H5650]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] 
2 who stand [[H5975]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] in the courts [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of our God. [[H430]] 
3 Praise [[H1984]] the LORD, [[H3050]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is good; [[H2896]] sing praises [[H2167]] to His name, [[H8034]] for [[H3588]] it is lovely. [[H5273]] 
4 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3050]] has chosen [[H977]] Jacob [[H3290]] as His own,  Israel [[H3478]] as His treasured possession. [[H5459]] 
5 For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is great; [[H1419]] our Lord [[H136]] is above all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]] 
6 The LORD [[H3068]] does [[H6213]] whatever [[H3605]] pleases Him [[H2654]] in the heavens [[H8064]] and on the earth, [[H776]] in the seas [[H3220]] and all [[H3605]] their depths. [[H8415]] 
7 He causes the clouds [[H5387]] to rise [[H5927]] from the ends [[H7097]] of the earth. [[H776]] He sends [[H6213]] lightning [[H1300]] with the rain [[H4306]] and brings [[H3318]] the wind [[H7307]] from His storehouses. [[H214]] 
8 He struck down [[H5221]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] of both man [[H120]] and [[H5704]] beast. [[H929]] 
9 He sent [[H7971]] signs [[H226]] and wonders [[H4159]] into your midst, [[H8432]] O Egypt, [[H4714]] against Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his servants. [[H5650]] 
10 He struck down [[H5221]] many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] and slaughtered [[H2026]] mighty [[H6099]] kings: [[H4428]] 
11 Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4467]] of Canaan. [[H3667]] 
12 He gave [[H5414]] their land [[H776]] as an inheritance, [[H5159]] a heritage [[H5159]] to His people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
13 Your name, [[H8034]] O LORD, [[H3068]] endures forever, [[H5769]] Your renown, [[H2143]] O LORD, [[H3068]] through all generations. [[H1755]] 
14 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will vindicate [[H1777]] His people [[H5971]] and will have compassion [[H5162]] on [[H5921]] His servants. [[H5650]] 
15 The idols [[H6091]] of the nations [[H1471]] are silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] made [[H4639]] by the hands [[H3027]] of men. [[H120]] 
16 They have mouths [[H6310]] but cannot [[H3808]] speak, [[H1696]] eyes [[H5869]] but cannot [[H3808]] see. [[H7200]] 
17 They have ears [[H241]] but cannot [[H3808]] hear, [[H238]] nor [[H369]] is there [[H3426]] breath [[H7307]] in their mouths. [[H6310]] 
18 Those who make them [[H6213]] will be [[H1961]] like them, [[H3644]] as will all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] trust in them. [[H982]] 
19 O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] praise [[H1288]] the LORD; [[H3068]] O house [[H1004]] of Aaron, [[H175]] praise [[H1288]] the LORD; [[H3068]] 
20 O house [[H1004]] of Levi, [[H3878]] praise [[H1288]] the LORD; [[H3068]] you who fear [[H3373]] the LORD, [[H3068]] praise [[H1288]] the LORD! [[H3068]] 
21 Blessed be [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] from Zion— [[H6726]] He who dwells [[H7931]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
