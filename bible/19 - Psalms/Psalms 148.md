2 Praise Him, [[H1984]] all [[H3605]] His angels; [[H4397]] praise Him, [[H1984]] all [[H3605]] His heavenly hosts. [[H6635]] 
3 Praise Him, [[H1984]] O sun [[H8121]] and moon; [[H3394]] praise Him, [[H1984]] all [[H3605]] you shining [[H216]] stars. [[H3556]]

5 Let them praise [[H1984]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] gave the command [[H6680]] and they were created. [[H1254]] 
6 He established them [[H5975]] forever [[H5703]] and ever; [[H5769]] He issued [[H5414]] a decree [[H2706]] that will never [[H3808]] pass away. [[H5674]] 
7 Praise [[H1984]] the LORD [[H3068]] from [[H4480]] the earth, [[H776]] all [[H3605]] great sea creatures [[H8577]] and ocean depths, [[H8415]] 
8 lightning [[H784]] and hail, [[H1259]] snow [[H7950]] and clouds, [[H7008]] powerful [[H5591]] wind [[H7307]] fulfilling [[H6213]] His word, [[H1697]] 
9 mountains [[H2022]] and all [[H3605]] hills, [[H1389]] fruit [[H6529]] trees [[H6086]] and all [[H3605]] cedars, [[H730]] 
10 wild animals [[H2416]] and all [[H3605]] cattle, [[H929]] crawling creatures [[H7431]] and flying [[H3671]] birds, [[H6833]] 
11 kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] peoples, [[H3816]] princes [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] rulers [[H8199]] of the earth, [[H776]] 
12 young men [[H970]] and [[H1571]] maidens, [[H1330]] old [[H2205]] and [[H5973]] young together. [[H5288]] 
13 Let them praise [[H1984]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] His name [[H8034]] alone [[H905]] is exalted; [[H7682]] His splendor [[H1935]] [is] above [[H5921]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth. [[H776]] 
14 He has raised up [[H7311]] a horn [[H7161]] for His people, [[H5971]] the praise [[H8416]] of all [[H3605]] His saints, [[H2623]] of Israel, [[H1121]] a people [[H5971]] near to Him. [[H7138]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
