# Psalms 137
[[Psalms 136|←]] • [[Psalms 138|→]]
1 By [[H5921]] the rivers [[H5104]] of Babylon [[H894]] we sat [[H3427]] and [[H1571]] wept [[H1058]] when we remembered [[H2142]] Zion. [[H6726]] 
2 There on [[H5921]] the poplars [[H6155]] we hung [[H8518]] our harps, [[H3658]] 
3 for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] our captors [[H7617]] requested [[H7592]] a song, [[H7892]] and our tormentors demanded [[H8437]] songs of joy: [[H8057]] “Sing [[H7891]] us  a song [[H7892]] of Zion.” [[H6726]] 
4 How [[H349]] can we sing [[H7891]] a song [[H7892]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in [[H5921]] a foreign [[H5236]] land? [[H127]] 
5 If [[H518]] I forget you, [[H7911]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] may my right hand [[H3225]] cease to function. [[H7911]] 
6 May my tongue [[H3956]] cling [[H1692]] to the roof of my mouth [[H2441]] if [[H518]] I do not [[H3808]] remember you, [[H2142]] if [[H518]] I do not [[H3808]] exalt [[H5927]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] as [[H5921]] my greatest [[H7218]] joy! [[H8057]] 
7 Remember, [[H2142]] O LORD, [[H3068]] the sons [[H1121]] of Edom [[H123]] on the day [[H3117]] Jerusalem [fell]: [[H3389]] “Destroy it,” [[H6168]] they said, [[H559]] “tear it down [[H6168]] to [[H5704]] its foundations!” [[H3247]] 
8 O Daughter [[H1323]] Babylon, [[H894]] doomed to destruction, [[H7703]] blessed [[H835]] is he who repays [[H7999]] you  as [[H1576]] you have done [[H1580]] to us.  
9 Blessed is [[H835]] he who seizes [[H270]] your infants [[H5768]] and dashes [[H5310]] them against [[H413]] the rocks. [[H5553]]
