[[Psalms 5|←]] • [[Psalms 7|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] With stringed instruments, [[H5058]] according to [[H5921]] Sheminith. [[H8067]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] O LORD, [[H3068]] do not [[H408]] rebuke [[H3198]] me in Your anger, [[H639]] or [[H408]] discipline [[H3256]] me in Your wrath. [[H2534]] 
2 Be merciful to me, [[H2603]] O LORD, [[H3069]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am frail; [[H536]] heal me, [[H7495]] O LORD, [[H3069]] for [[H3588]] my bones [[H6106]] are in agony. [[H926]] 
3 My soul [[H5315]] is deeply distressed. [[H926]] How long, [[H5704]] O [[H859]] LORD, [[H3068]] how long? [[H4970]] 
4 Turn, [[H7725]] O LORD, [[H3068]] [and] deliver [[H2502]] my soul; [[H5315]] save me [[H3467]] because of [[H4616]] Your loving devotion. [[H2617]] 
5 For [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] mention of You [[H2143]] in death; [[H4194]] who [[H4310]] can praise [[H3034]] You  from Sheol? [[H7585]] 
6 I am weary [[H3021]] from groaning; [[H585]] all [[H3605]] night [[H3915]] I flood [[H7811]] my bed with {weeping} [[H4296]] [and] drench [[H4529]] my couch [[H6210]] with tears. [[H1832]] 
7 My eyes [[H5869]] fail [[H6244]] from grief; [[H3708]] they grow dim [[H6275]] because of all [[H3605]] my foes. [[H6887]] 
8 Depart [[H5493]] from me, [[H4480]] all [[H3605]] you workers [[H6466]] of iniquity, [[H205]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has heard [[H8085]] my weeping. [[H1065]] 
9 The LORD [[H3068]] has heard [[H8085]] my cry for mercy; [[H8467]] the LORD [[H3068]] accepts [[H3947]] my prayer. [[H8605]] 
10 All [[H3605]] my enemies [[H341]] will be ashamed [[H954]] and dismayed; [[H926]] they will turn back [[H7725]] in sudden [[H7281]] disgrace. [[H954]]
