[[Psalms 52|←]] • [[Psalms 54|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] According to [[H5921]] Mahalath. [[H4257]] A Maskil [[H4905]] of David. [[H1732]] The fool [[H5036]] says [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] “[There is] no [[H369]] God.” [[H430]] They are corrupt; [[H7843]] their ways [[H8581]] are vile. [[H5766]] There is no [[H369]] one who does [[H6213]] good. [[H2896]] 
2 God [[H430]] looks down [[H8259]] from heaven [[H8064]] upon [[H5921]] the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] to see [[H7200]] if any [[H3426]] understand, [[H7919]] if any seek [[H1875]] God. [[H430]] 
3 All [[H3605]] have turned away, [[H5472]] they have together [[H3162]] become corrupt; [[H444]] there is no [[H369]] one who does [[H6213]] good, [[H2896]] not [[H369]] even [[H1571]] one. [[H259]] 
4 Will the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] never [[H3808]] learn? [[H3045]] They devour [[H398]] my people [[H5971]] [like] [[H398]] bread; [[H3899]] they refuse [[H3808]] to call upon [[H7121]] the LORD. [[H430]] 
5 There they are, [[H8033]] overwhelmed [[H6342]] with dread, [[H6343]] [where] there was [[H1961]] nothing [[H3808]] to fear. [[H6343]] For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has scattered [[H6340]] the bones [[H6106]] of those who besieged you. [[H2583]] You will put them to shame, [[H954]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has despised them. [[H3988]] 
6 Oh, that [[H4310]] the salvation [[H3444]] of Israel [[H3478]] would come [[H5414]] from Zion! [[H6726]] When God [[H430]] restores [[H7725]] His Captive [[H7622]] people, [[H5971]] let Jacob [[H3290]] rejoice, [[H1523]] let Israel [[H3478]] be glad! [[H8055]]
