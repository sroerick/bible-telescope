# Psalms 107
[[Psalms 106|←]] • [[Psalms 108|→]]
1 Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He is good; [[H2896]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever. [[H5769]] 
2 Let the redeemed [[H1350]] of the LORD [[H3068]] say so, [[H559]] whom [[H834]] He has redeemed [[H1350]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy [[H6862]] 
3 and gathered [[H6908]] from the lands, [[H776]] from east [[H4217]] and west, [[H4628]] from north [[H6828]] and south. [[H3220]] 
4 Some wandered [[H8582]] in desert [[H4057]] wastelands, [[H3452]] finding [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] path [[H1870]] to a city [[H5892]] to dwell in. [[H4186]] 
5 They were hungry [[H7457]] and [[H1571]] thirsty; [[H6771]] their soul [[H5315]] fainted [[H5848]] within them.  
6 Then they cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3069]] in their trouble; [[H6862]] He delivered [[H5337]] them [[H1992]] from their distress. [[H4691]] 
7 He led them [[H1869]] on a straight [[H3477]] path [[H1870]] to reach [[H1980]] a city [[H5892]] where they could live. [[H4186]] 
8 Let them give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for His loving devotion [[H2617]] and His wonders [[H6381]] to the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]] 
9 For [[H3588]] He satisfies [[H7646]] the thirsty [[H8264]] and fills [[H4390]] the hungry [[H7457]] with good things. [[H2896]] 
10 Some sat [[H3427]] in darkness [[H2822]] and in the shadow of death, [[H6757]] prisoners [[H615]] in misery [[H6040]] and chains, [[H1270]] 
11 because [[H3588]] they rebelled [[H4784]] against the words [[H561]] of God [[H410]] and despised [[H5006]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the Most High. [[H5945]] 
12 He humbled [[H3665]] their hearts [[H3820]] with hard labor; [[H5999]] they stumbled, [[H3782]] and there was no [[H369]] one to help. [[H5826]] 
13 Then they cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3069]] in their trouble; [[H6862]] He saved [[H3467]] them [[H1992]] from their distress. [[H4691]] 
14 He brought them out [[H3318]] of darkness [[H2822]] and the shadow of death [[H6757]] and broke away their chains. [[H4147]] 
15 Let them give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for His loving devotion [[H2617]] and His wonders [[H6381]] to the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]] 
16 For [[H3588]] He has broken down [[H7665]] the gates [[H1817]] of bronze [[H5178]] and cut through [[H1438]] the bars [[H1280]] of iron. [[H1270]] 
17 Fools, [[H191]] in their rebellious [[H6588]] ways, [[H1870]] and through their iniquities, [[H5771]] suffered affliction. [[H6031]] 
18 They [[H5315]] loathed [[H8581]] all [[H3605]] food [[H400]] and drew near [[H5060]] to [[H5704]] the gates [[H8179]] of death. [[H4194]] 
19 Then they cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3069]] in their trouble; [[H6862]] He saved them [[H3467]] from their distress. [[H4691]] 
20 He sent forth [[H7971]] His word [[H1697]] and healed them; [[H7495]] He rescued them [[H4422]] from the Pit. [[H7825]] 
21 Let them give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for His loving devotion [[H2617]] and His wonders [[H6381]] to the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]] 
22 Let them offer [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] of thanksgiving [[H8426]] and declare [[H5608]] His works [[H4639]] with rejoicing. [[H7440]] 
23 Others went [[H3381]] out to sea [[H3220]] in ships, [[H591]] conducting [[H6213]] trade [[H4399]] on the mighty [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]] 
24 They [[H1992]] saw [[H7200]] the works [[H4639]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and His wonders [[H6381]] in the deep. [[H4688]] 
25 For He spoke [[H559]] and raised [[H5975]] a tempest [[H5591]] that lifted [[H7311]] the waves [[H1530]] of [the sea].  
26 They mounted up [[H5927]] to the heavens, [[H8064]] they sunk [[H3381]] to the depths; [[H8415]] their courage [[H5315]] melted [[H4127]] in their anguish. [[H7451]] 
27 They reeled [[H2287]] and staggered [[H5128]] like drunkards, [[H7910]] and all [[H3605]] their skill [[H2451]] was useless. [[H1104]] 
28 Then they cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3069]] in their trouble, [[H6862]] and He brought [[H3318]] them out [[H1992]] of their distress. [[H4691]] 
29 He calmed [[H6965]] the storm [[H5591]] to a whisper, [[H1827]] and the waves of the sea [[H1530]] were hushed. [[H2814]] 
30 They rejoiced [[H8055]] in [[H3588]] the silence [[H8367]] and He guided [[H5148]] them to [[H413]] the harbor [[H4231]] they desired. [[H2656]] 
31 Let them give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for His loving devotion [[H2617]] and His wonders [[H6381]] to the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]] 
32 Let them exalt [[H7311]] Him in the assembly [[H6951]] of the people [[H5971]] and praise Him [[H1984]] in the council [[H4186]] of the elders. [[H2205]] 
33 He turns [[H7760]] rivers [[H5104]] into deserts, [[H4057]] springs [[H4161]] of water [[H4325]] into thirsty ground, [[H6774]] 
34 fruitful [[H6529]] land [[H776]] into fields of salt, [[H4420]] because of the wickedness [[H7451]] of its dwellers. [[H3427]] 
35 He turns [[H7760]] a desert [[H4057]] into pools [[H98]] of water, [[H4325]] and a dry [[H6723]] land [[H776]] into flowing springs. [[H4161]] 
36 He causes the hungry [[H7457]] to settle [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] that they may establish [[H3559]] a city [[H5892]] to dwell. [[H4186]] 
37 They sow [[H2232]] fields [[H7704]] and plant [[H5193]] vineyards [[H3754]] that yield [[H6213]] a fruitful [[H6529]] harvest. [[H8393]] 
38 He blesses them, [[H1288]] and they multiply [[H7235]] greatly; [[H3966]] He does not [[H3808]] let their herds [[H929]] diminish. [[H4591]] 
39 When they are decreased [[H4591]] and humbled [[H7817]] by oppression, [[H6115]] evil, [[H7451]] and sorrow, [[H3015]] 
40 He pours [[H8210]] contempt [[H937]] on [[H5921]] the nobles [[H5081]] and makes them wander [[H8582]] a pathless [[H3808]] wasteland. [[H8414]] 
41 But He lifts [[H7682]] the needy [[H34]] from affliction [[H6040]] and increases [[H7760]] their families [[H4940]] like flocks. [[H6629]] 
42 The upright [[H3477]] see [[H7200]] and rejoice, [[H8055]] and all [[H3605]] iniquity [[H5766]] shuts [[H7092]] its mouth. [[H6310]] 
43 Let him who [[H4310]] is wise [[H2450]] pay heed [[H8104]] to these things [[H428]] and consider [[H995]] the loving devotion [[H2617]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
