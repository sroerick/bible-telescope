# Psalms 99
[[Psalms 98|←]] • [[Psalms 100|→]]
1 The LORD [[H3068]] reigns, [[H4427]] let the nations [[H5971]] tremble! [[H7264]] He is enthroned [[H3427]] above the cherubim. [[H3742]] Let the earth [[H776]] quake. [[H5120]] 
2 Great is [[H1419]] the LORD [[H3068]] in Zion; [[H6726]] He [[H1931]] is exalted [[H7311]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the peoples. [[H5971]] 
3 Let them praise [[H3034]] Your great [[H1419]] and awesome [[H3372]] name— [[H8034]] He [[H1931]] is holy! [[H6918]] 
4 The mighty [[H5797]] King [[H4428]] loves [[H157]] justice. [[H4941]] You [[H859]] have established [[H3559]] equity; [[H4339]] You [[H859]] have exercised [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6666]] in Jacob. [[H3290]] 
5 Exalt [[H7311]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and worship [[H7812]] at [[H1916]] His footstool; [[H7272]] He [[H1931]] is holy! [[H6918]] 
6 Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] were among His priests, [[H3548]] and Samuel [[H8050]] among those who called [[H7121]] on His name. [[H8034]] They called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] and He [[H1931]] answered. [[H6030]] 
7 He spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] them in a pillar [[H5982]] of cloud; [[H6051]] they kept [[H8104]] His decrees [[H5713]] and the statutes [[H2706]] He gave [[H5414]] them.  
8 O LORD [[H3069]] our God, [[H430]] You [[H859]] answered them. [[H6030]] You were [[H1961]] a forgiving [[H5375]] God [[H410]] to them, [[H1992]] yet an avenger [[H5358]] of [[H5921]] their misdeeds. [[H5949]] 
9 Exalt [[H7311]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] and worship [[H7812]] at His holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] is holy. [[H6918]]
