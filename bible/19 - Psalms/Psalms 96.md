[[Psalms 95|←]] • [[Psalms 97|→]]
1 Sing [[H7891]] to the LORD [[H3068]] a new [[H2319]] song; [[H7892]] sing [[H7891]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]] 
2 Sing [[H7891]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] praise [[H1288]] His name; [[H8034]] proclaim [[H1319]] His salvation [[H3444]] day [[H3117]] after day. [[H3117]] 
3 Declare [[H5608]] His glory [[H3519]] among the nations, [[H1471]] His wonderful deeds [[H6381]] among all [[H3605]] peoples. [[H5971]] 
4 For [[H3588]] great is [[H1419]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and greatly [[H3966]] to be praised; [[H1984]] He is to be feared [[H3372]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]] 
5 For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H5971]] are idols, [[H457]] but [it is] the LORD [[H3068]] who made [[H6213]] the heavens. [[H8064]] 
6 Splendor [[H1935]] and majesty [[H1926]] are before Him; [[H6440]] strength [[H5797]] and beauty [[H8597]] fill His sanctuary. [[H4720]] 
7 Ascribe [[H3051]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] O families [[H4940]] of the nations, [[H5971]] ascribe [[H3051]] to the LORD [[H3068]] glory [[H3519]] and strength. [[H5797]] 
8 Ascribe [[H3051]] to the LORD [[H3068]] the glory [[H3519]] [due] His name; [[H8034]] bring [[H5375]] an offering [[H4503]] and enter [[H935]] His courts. [[H2691]] 
9 Worship [[H7812]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the splendor [[H1927]] of His holiness; [[H6944]] tremble [[H2342]] before Him, [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]] 
10 Declare [[H559]] among the nations: [[H1471]] “The LORD [[H3068]] reigns.” [[H4427]] The world [[H8398]] is firmly established; [[H3559]] it cannot [[H1077]] be moved; [[H4131]] He judges [[H1777]] the peoples [[H5971]] with equity. [[H4339]] 
11 Let the heavens [[H8064]] be glad [[H8055]] and the earth [[H776]] rejoice; [[H1523]] let the sea [[H3220]] resound, [[H7481]] and all that fills it. [[H4393]] 
12 Let the fields [[H7704]] exult, [[H5937]] and all [[H3605]] that [is] [[H834]] in them.  Then [[H227]] all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the forest [[H3293]] will sing for joy [[H7442]] 
13 before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He is coming— [[H935]] He is coming [[H935]] to judge [[H8199]] the earth. [[H776]] He will judge [[H8199]] the world [[H8398]] in righteousness [[H6664]] and the peoples [[H5971]] in His faithfulness. [[H530]]
