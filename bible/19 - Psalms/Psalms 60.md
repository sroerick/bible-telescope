# Psalms 60
[[Psalms 59|←]] • [[Psalms 61|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] To the tune of [[H5921]] “The Lily of Testimony.” [[H7802]] A Miktam [[H4387]] of David [[H1732]] for instruction. [[H3925]] When he fought [[H5327]] Aram-naharaim [[H763]] and Aram-zobah, [[H760]] and Joab [[H3097]] returned [[H7725]] and struck down [[H5221]] 12,000 [[H8147]] Edomites [[H123]] in the Valley of Salt. [[H1516]] You have rejected us, [[H2186]] O God; [[H430]] You have broken us; [[H6555]] You have been angry; [[H599]] restore us! [[H7725]] 
2 You have shaken [[H7493]] the land [[H776]] and torn it open. [[H6480]] Heal [[H7495]] its fractures, [[H7667]] for [[H3588]] it is quaking. [[H4131]] 
3 You have shown [[H7200]] Your people [[H5971]] hardship; [[H7186]] we are staggered [[H8653]] from the wine [[H3196]] You made us drink. [[H8248]] 
4 You have raised [[H5414]] a banner [[H5251]] for those who fear You, [[H3373]] that they may flee [[H5127]] the bow. [[H7189]] Selah [[H5542]] 
5 Save us [[H3467]] with Your right hand; [[H3225]] answer us, [[H6032]] that [[H4616]] those You love [[H3039]] may be delivered. [[H2502]] 
6 God [[H430]] has spoken [[H1696]] from His sanctuary: [[H6944]] “I will triumph! [[H5937]] I will parcel out [[H2505]] Shechem [[H7927]] and apportion [[H4058]] the Valley [[H6010]] of Succoth. [[H5523]] 
7 Gilead is Mine, [[H1568]] and Manasseh is Mine; [[H4519]] Ephraim [[H669]] is My helmet [[H4581]] [and] Judah [[H3063]] is My scepter. [[H2710]] 
8 Moab [[H4124]] is My washbasin; [[H5518]] upon [[H5921]] Edom [[H123]] I toss [[H7993]] My sandal; [[H5275]] over [[H5921]] Philistia [[H6429]] I shout in triumph.” [[H7321]] 
9 Who [[H4310]] will bring [[H2986]] me to the fortified [[H4692]] city? [[H5892]] Who [[H4310]] will lead [[H5148]] me to [[H5704]] Edom? [[H123]] 
10 Have You not [[H3808]] rejected us, [[H2186]] O God? [[H430]] Will You not [[H3808]] march out [[H3318]] with our armies? [[H6635]] 
11 Give [[H3051]] us  aid [[H5833]] against the enemy, [[H6862]] for the help [[H8668]] of man [[H120]] is worthless. [[H7723]] 
12 With God [[H430]] we will perform [[H6213]] with valor; [[H2428]] He [[H1931]] will trample [[H947]] our enemies. [[H6862]]
