# Psalms 83
[[Psalms 82|←]] • [[Psalms 84|→]]
1 A Song. [[H7892]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]] O God, [[H430]] do not [[H408]] keep silent; [[H1824]] do not [[H408]] hold Your peace; [[H2790]] do not [[H408]] be still, [[H8252]] O God. [[H410]] 
2 See [[H2009]] how [[H3588]] Your enemies [[H341]] rage, [[H1993]] how your foes [[H8130]] have reared [[H5375]] their heads. [[H7218]] 
3 With cunning [[H6191]] they scheme [[H5475]] against [[H5921]] Your people [[H5971]] and conspire [[H3289]] against [[H5921]] those You cherish, [[H6845]] 
4 saying, [[H559]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us erase them [[H3582]] as a nation; [[H1471]] may the name [[H8034]] of Israel [[H3478]] be remembered [[H2142]] no [[H3808]] more.” [[H5750]] 
5 For [[H3588]] with one mind [[H3820]] they plot [[H3289]] together, [[H3162]] they form [[H3772]] an alliance [[H1285]] against You— [[H5921]] 
6 the tents [[H168]] of Edom [[H123]] and the Ishmaelites, [[H3459]] of Moab [[H4124]] and the Hagrites, [[H1905]] 
7 Gebal, [[H1381]] Ammon, [[H5983]] and Amalek, [[H6002]] Philistia [[H6429]] with [[H5973]] the people [[H3427]] of Tyre. [[H6865]] 
8 Even [[H1571]] Assyria [[H804]] has joined [[H3867]] them, [[H5973]] lending [[H1961]] strength [[H2220]] to the sons [[H1121]] of Lot. [[H3876]] Selah [[H5542]] 
9 Do [[H6213]] to them [[H1992]] as You did to Midian, [[H4080]] as to Sisera [[H5516]] and Jabin [[H2985]] at the River [[H5158]] Kishon, [[H7028]] 
10 who perished [[H8045]] at Endor [[H5874]] and became [[H1961]] [like] dung [[H1828]] on the ground. [[H127]] 
11 Make [[H7896]] their nobles [[H5081]] like Oreb [[H6159]] and Zeeb, [[H2062]] and all [[H3605]] their princes [[H5257]] like Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] 
12 who [[H834]] said, [[H559]] “Let us possess [[H3423]] for ourselves [[H853]] the pastures [[H4999]] of God.” [[H430]] 
13 Make [[H7896]] them like tumbleweed, [[H1534]] O my God, [[H430]] like chaff [[H7179]] before [[H6440]] the wind. [[H7307]] 
14 As fire [[H784]] consumes [[H1197]] a forest, [[H3293]] as a flame [[H3852]] sets [[H3857]] the mountains {ablaze}, [[H2022]] 
15 so [[H3651]] pursue them [[H7291]] with Your tempest, [[H5591]] and terrify them [[H926]] with Your storm. [[H5492]] 
16 Cover [[H4390]] their faces [[H6440]] with shame, [[H7036]] that they may seek [[H1245]] Your name, [[H8034]] O LORD. [[H3068]] 
17 May they be ever ashamed [[H954]] and terrified; [[H926]] may they perish [[H6]] in disgrace. [[H2659]] 
18 May they know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] You [[H859]] alone, [[H905]] whose name [[H8034]] is the LORD, [[H3068]] are Most High [[H5945]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]
