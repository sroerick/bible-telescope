# Psalms 23
[[Psalms 22|←]] • [[Psalms 24|→]]
1 A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] The LORD [[H3068]] is my shepherd; [[H7462]] I shall not [[H3808]] want. [[H2637]] 
2 He makes me lie down [[H7257]] in green [[H1877]] pastures; [[H4999]] He leads [[H5095]] me beside [[H5921]] quiet [[H4496]] waters. [[H4325]] 
3 He restores [[H7725]] my soul; [[H5315]] He guides me [[H5148]] in the paths [[H4570]] of righteousness [[H6664]] for the sake [[H4616]] of His name. [[H8034]] 
4 Even [[H1571]] though [[H3588]] I walk [[H1980]] through the valley [[H1516]] of the shadow of death, [[H6757]] I will fear [[H3372]] no [[H3808]] evil, [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are with me; [[H5978]] Your rod [[H7626]] and Your staff, [[H4938]] they [[H1992]] comfort me. [[H5162]] 
5 You prepare [[H6186]] a table [[H7979]] before me [[H6440]] in the presence of [[H5048]] my enemies. [[H6887]] You anoint [[H1878]] my head [[H7218]] with oil; [[H8081]] my cup [[H3563]] overflows. [[H7310]] 
6 Surely [[H389]] goodness [[H2896]] and mercy [[H2617]] will follow me [[H7291]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of my life, [[H2416]] and I will dwell [[H3427]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] forever. [[H753]]
