# Psalms 110
[[Psalms 109|←]] • [[Psalms 111|→]]
1 A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H5002]] to my Lord: [[H113]] “Sit [[H3427]] at My right hand [[H3225]] until [[H5704]] I make [[H7896]] Your enemies [[H341]] a footstool [[H1916]] for Your feet.” [[H7272]] 
2 The LORD [[H3068]] will extend [[H7971]] Your mighty [[H5797]] scepter [[H4294]] from Zion: [[H6726]] “Rule [[H7287]] in the midst [[H7130]] of your enemies.” [[H341]] 
3 Your people [[H5971]] [shall be] willing [[H5071]] on Your day [[H3117]] of battle. [[H2428]] Arrayed in holy [[H6944]] splendor, [[H1926]] from the womb [[H7358]] of the dawn, [[H4891]] to You belongs  the dew [[H2919]] of Your youth. [[H3208]] 
4 The LORD [[H3068]] has sworn [[H7650]] and will not [[H3808]] change His mind: [[H5162]] “You [[H859]] are a priest [[H3548]] forever [[H5769]] in [[H5921]] the order [[H1700]] of Melchizedek.” [[H4442]] 
5 The Lord [[H136]] is at [[H5921]] Your right hand; [[H3225]] He will crush [[H4272]] kings [[H4428]] in the day [[H3117]] of His wrath. [[H639]] 
6 He will judge [[H1777]] the nations, [[H1471]] heaping up [[H4390]] the dead; [[H1472]] He will crush [[H4272]] the leaders [[H7218]] far [[H5921]] and wide. [[H7227]] 
7 He will drink [[H8354]] from the brook [[H5158]] by the road; [[H1870]] therefore [[H5921]] He will lift up [[H7311]] His head. [[H7218]]
