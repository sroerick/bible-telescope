[[Psalms 80|←]] • [[Psalms 82|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] According to [[H5921]] Gittith. [[H1665]] Of Asaph. [[H623]] Sing for joy [[H7442]] to God [[H430]] our strength; [[H5797]] make a joyful noise [[H7321]] to the God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] 
2 Lift up [[H5375]] a song, [[H2172]] strike [[H5414]] the tambourine, [[H8596]] play the sweet-sounding [[H5273]] harp [[H5035]] and [[H5973]] lyre. [[H3658]] 
3 Sound [[H8628]] the ram’s horn [[H7782]] at the New Moon, [[H2320]] [and] at the full moon [[H3677]] on the day [[H3117]] of our Feast. [[H2282]] 
4 For [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] is a statute [[H2706]] for Israel, [[H3478]] an ordinance [[H4941]] of the God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] 
5 He ordained it [[H7760]] as a testimony [[H5715]] for Joseph [[H3084]] when he went out [[H3318]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] [where] I heard [[H8085]] an unfamiliar [[H3808]] language: [[H8193]] 
6 “I relieved [[H5493]] his shoulder [[H7926]] of the burden; [[H5447]] his hands [[H3709]] were freed [[H5674]] from the basket. [[H1731]] 
7 You called out [[H7121]] in distress, [[H6869]] and I rescued you; [[H2502]] I answered [[H6030]] you from the cloud [[H5643]] of thunder; [[H7482]] I tested [[H974]] you at [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Meribah. [[H4809]] Selah [[H5542]] 
8 Hear, [[H8085]] O My people, [[H5971]] and I will warn you: [[H5749]] O Israel, [[H3478]] if only [[H518]] you would listen [[H8085]] to Me!  
9 There must be no [[H3808]] strange [[H2114]] god [[H410]] among you,  nor shall you [[H3808]] bow [[H7812]] to a foreign [[H5236]] god. [[H410]] 
10 I [[H595]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who brought you up [[H5927]] out of Egypt. [[H4714]] Open wide your mouth, [[H6310]] and I will fill it. [[H4390]] 
11 But My people [[H5971]] would not [[H3808]] listen to Me, [[H8085]] and Israel [[H3478]] would not [[H3808]] obey [[H14]] Me.  
12 So I gave them up [[H7971]] to their stubborn [[H8307]] hearts [[H3820]] to follow [[H1980]] their own devices. [[H4156]] 
13 If only [[H3863]] My people [[H5971]] would listen [[H8085]] to Me,  if Israel [[H3478]] would follow [[H1980]] My ways, [[H1870]] 
14 how soon [[H4592]] I would subdue [[H3665]] their enemies [[H341]] and turn [[H7725]] My hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] their foes. [[H6862]] 
15 Those who hate [[H8130]] the LORD [[H3068]] would feign obedience, [[H3584]] and their doom [[H6256]] would last forever. [[H1961]] 
16 But I would feed you [[H398]] the finest [[H2459]] wheat; [[H2406]] with honey [[H1706]] from the rock [[H6697]] I would satisfy you.” [[H7646]]
