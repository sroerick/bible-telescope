[[Psalms 23|←]] • [[Psalms 25|→]]
1 A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] The earth [[H776]] [is] the LORD’s, [[H3068]] and the fullness thereof, [[H4393]] the world [[H8398]] and all who dwell [[H3427]] therein.  
2 For [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] has founded it [[H3245]] upon [[H5921]] the seas [[H3220]] and established it [[H3559]] upon [[H5921]] the waters. [[H5104]] 
3 Who [[H4310]] may ascend [[H5927]] the hill [[H2022]] of the LORD? [[H3068]] Who [[H4310]] may stand [[H6965]] in His holy [[H6944]] place? [[H4725]] 
4 He who has clean [[H5355]] hands [[H3709]] and a pure [[H1249]] heart, [[H3824]] who [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] lift up [[H5375]] his soul [[H5315]] to falsehood, [[H7723]] who does not [[H3808]] swear [[H7650]] deceitfully. [[H4820]] 
5 He shall receive [[H5375]] blessing [[H1293]] from the LORD, [[H3068]] and vindication [[H6666]] from the God [[H430]] of his salvation. [[H3468]] 
6 Such [[H2088]] is the generation [[H1755]] of those who seek [[H1875]] Him,  who seek [[H1245]] Your face, [[H6440]] [O God] of Jacob. [[H3290]] Selah [[H5542]] 
7 Lift up [[H5375]] your heads, [[H7218]] O gates! [[H8179]] Be lifted up, [[H5375]] O ancient [[H5769]] doors, [[H6607]] that the King [[H4428]] of Glory [[H3519]] may enter! [[H935]] 
8 Who [[H4310]] is this [[H2088]] King [[H4428]] of Glory? [[H3519]] The LORD [[H3068]] strong [[H5808]] and mighty, [[H1368]] the LORD [[H3068]] mighty [[H1368]] in battle. [[H4421]] 
9 Lift up [[H5375]] your heads, [[H7218]] O gates! [[H8179]] Be lifted up, [[H5375]] O ancient [[H5769]] doors, [[H6607]] that the King [[H4428]] of Glory [[H3519]] may enter! [[H935]] 
10 Who [[H4310]] is He, [[H1931]] this [[H2088]] King [[H4428]] of Glory? [[H3519]] The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts— [[H6635]] He [[H1931]] is the King [[H4428]] of Glory. [[H3519]] Selah [[H5542]]
