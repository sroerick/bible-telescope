# Psalms 106
[[Psalms 105|←]] • [[Psalms 107|→]]
1 Hallelujah! [[H1984]] Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He is good; [[H2896]] His loving devotion endures forever. [[H2617]] 
2 Who [[H4310]] can describe [[H4448]] the mighty acts [[H1369]] of the LORD [[H3068]] or fully proclaim [[H8085]] His praise? [[H8416]] 
3 Blessed [are] [[H835]] those who uphold [[H8104]] justice, [[H4941]] who practice [[H6213]] righteousness [[H6666]] at all [[H3605]] times. [[H6256]] 
4 Remember me, [[H2142]] O LORD, [[H3068]] in [Your] favor [[H7522]] to Your people. [[H5971]] Visit me [[H6485]] with Your salvation, [[H3444]] 
5 that I may see [[H7200]] the prosperity [[H2896]] of Your chosen ones, [[H972]] and rejoice [[H8055]] in the gladness [[H8057]] of Your nation, [[H1471]] and give glory [[H1984]] with [[H5973]] Your inheritance. [[H5159]] 
6 We have sinned [[H2398]] like [[H5973]] our fathers; [[H1]] we have done wrong [[H5753]] [and] acted wickedly. [[H7561]] 
7 Our fathers [[H1]] in Egypt [[H4714]] did not [[H3808]] grasp [[H7919]] Your wonders [[H6381]] or remember [[H2142]] Your abundant [[H7230]] kindness; [[H2617]] but they rebelled [[H4784]] by [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] [there] at the Red [[H5488]] Sea. [[H3220]] 
8 Yet He saved them [[H3467]] for the sake of [[H4616]] His name, [[H8034]] to make His power [[H1369]] known. [[H3045]] 
9 He rebuked [[H1605]] the Red [[H5488]] Sea, [[H3220]] and it dried up; [[H2717]] He led them [[H1980]] through the depths [[H8415]] as through a desert. [[H4057]] 
10 He saved them [[H3467]] from the hand [[H3027]] that hated them, [[H8130]] and redeemed them [[H1350]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy. [[H341]] 
11 The waters [[H4325]] covered [[H3680]] their foes; [[H6862]] not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of them [[H1992]] remained. [[H3498]] 
12 Then they believed [[H539]] His promises [[H1697]] and sang [[H7891]] His praise. [[H8416]] 
13 [Yet] they soon [[H4116]] forgot [[H7911]] His works [[H4639]] and failed [[H3808]] to wait [[H2442]] for His counsel. [[H6098]] 
14 They craved [[H183]] intensely [[H8378]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] and tested [[H5254]] God [[H410]] in the desert. [[H3452]] 
15 So He granted [[H5414]] their request, [[H7596]] but sent [[H7971]] a wasting disease [[H7332]] upon them. [[H5315]] 
16 In the camp [[H4264]] they envied [[H7065]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] the holy one [[H6918]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
17 The earth [[H776]] opened up [[H6605]] and swallowed [[H1104]] Dathan; [[H1885]] it covered [[H3680]] the assembly [[H5712]] of Abiram. [[H48]] 
18 Then fire [[H784]] blazed [[H1197]] through their company; [[H5712]] flames [[H3852]] consumed [[H3857]] the wicked. [[H7563]] 
19 At Horeb [[H2722]] they made [[H6213]] a calf [[H5695]] and worshiped [[H7812]] a molten image. [[H4541]] 
20 They exchanged [[H4171]] their Glory [[H3519]] for the image [[H8403]] of an ox [[H7794]] that eats [[H398]] grass. [[H6212]] 
21 They forgot [[H7911]] God [[H410]] their Savior, [[H3467]] who did [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] things in Egypt, [[H4714]] 
22 wondrous works [[H6381]] in the land [[H776]] of Ham, [[H2526]] [and] awesome deeds [[H3372]] by [[H5921]] the Red [[H5488]] Sea. [[H3220]] 
23 So He said [[H559]] He would destroy them— [[H8045]] had not [[H3884]] Moses [[H4872]] His chosen one [[H972]] stood [[H5975]] before Him [[H6440]] in the breach [[H6556]] to divert [[H7725]] His wrath [[H2534]] from destroying them. [[H7843]] 
24 They despised [[H3988]] the pleasant [[H2532]] land; [[H776]] they did not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] His promise. [[H1697]] 
25 They grumbled [[H7279]] in their tents [[H168]] and did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
26 So He raised [[H5375]] His hand [[H3027]] {and swore} [[H1992]] to cast them down [[H5307]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] 
27 to disperse [[H5307]] their offspring [[H2233]] among the nations [[H1471]] and scatter them [[H2219]] throughout the lands. [[H776]] 
28 They yoked themselves [[H6775]] to  Baal of Peor [[H1187]] and ate [[H398]] sacrifices [[H2077]] offered to lifeless gods. [[H4191]] 
29 So they provoked [the LORD] to anger [[H3707]] with their deeds, [[H4611]] and a plague [[H4046]] broke out [[H6555]] among them.  
30 But Phinehas [[H6372]] stood [[H5975]] and intervened, [[H6419]] and the plague [[H4046]] was restrained. [[H6113]] 
31 It was credited [[H2803]] to him  as righteousness [[H6666]] for endless [[H1755]] generations [[H1755]] to come. [[H5704]] 
32 At the waters [[H4325]] of Meribah [[H4808]] they angered [[H7107]] the LORD, [[H5921]] and trouble came [[H3415]] to Moses [[H4872]] because of them. [[H5668]] 
33 For [[H3588]] they rebelled against [[H4784]] His Spirit, [[H7307]] and [Moses] spoke rashly [[H981]] with his lips. [[H8193]] 
34 They did not [[H3808]] destroy [[H8045]] the peoples [[H5971]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] had commanded [[H559]] them, [[H1992]] 
35 but they mingled [[H6148]] with the nations [[H1471]] and adopted [[H3925]] their customs. [[H4639]] 
36 They worshiped [[H5647]] their idols, [[H6091]] which became [[H1961]] a snare to them. [[H4170]] 
37 They sacrificed [[H2076]] their sons [[H1121]] and [[H853]] their daughters [[H1323]] to demons. [[H7700]] 
38 They shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood— [[H1818]] the blood [[H1818]] of their sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] whom [[H834]] they sacrificed [[H2076]] to the idols [[H6091]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and the land [[H776]] was polluted [[H2610]] with blood. [[H1818]] 
39 They defiled themselves [[H2930]] by their actions [[H4639]] and prostituted themselves [[H2181]] by their deeds. [[H4611]] 
40 So the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against His people, [[H5971]] and He abhorred [[H8581]] His own inheritance. [[H5159]] 
41 He delivered them [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the nations, [[H1471]] and those who hated them [[H8130]] ruled [[H4910]] over them.  
42 Their enemies [[H341]] oppressed them, [[H3905]] and subdued them [[H3665]] under [[H8478]] their hand. [[H3027]] 
43 Many [[H7227]] times [[H6471]] He rescued them, [[H5337]] but they [[H1992]] were bent [[H4784]] on rebellion [[H6098]] and sank down [[H4355]] in their iniquity. [[H5771]] 
44 Nevertheless He heard [[H8085]] their cry; [[H7440]] He took note [[H7200]] of their distress. [[H6862]] 
45 And He remembered [[H2142]] His covenant [[H1285]] with them, [[H1992]] and relented [[H5162]] by the abundance [[H7230]] of His loving devotion. [[H2617]] 
46 He made [[H5414]] them [[H853]] objects of compassion [[H7356]] to [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] who held them captive. [[H7617]] 
47 Save us, [[H3467]] O LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and gather [[H6908]] us from [[H4480]] the nations, [[H1471]] that we may give thanks [[H3034]] to Your holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] that we may glory [[H7623]] in Your praise. [[H8416]] 
48 Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] from [[H4480]] everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting. [[H5769]] Let all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] “Amen!” [[H543]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
