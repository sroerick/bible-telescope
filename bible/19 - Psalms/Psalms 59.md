# Psalms 59
[[Psalms 58|←]] • [[Psalms 60|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] To the tune of  “Do Not Destroy.” [[H516]] A Miktam [[H4387]] of David, [[H1732]] when Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] men to watch [[H8104]] [his] house [[H1004]] to kill him. [[H4191]] Deliver me [[H5337]] from my enemies, [[H341]] O my God; [[H430]] protect me [[H7682]] from those who rise against me. [[H6965]] 
2 Deliver me [[H5337]] from workers [[H6466]] of iniquity, [[H205]] and save me [[H3467]] from men of bloodshed. [[H1818]] 
3 See [[H2009]] how they lie in wait [[H693]] for me. [[H5315]] Fierce men [[H5794]] conspire [[H1481]] against me [[H5921]] for no [[H3808]] transgression [[H6588]] [or] [[H3808]] sin [of my own], [[H2403]] O LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 For no [[H1097]] fault of my own, [[H5771]] they move swiftly [[H7323]] to attack me. [[H3559]] Arise [[H5782]] to help me, [[H7125]] and take notice. [[H7200]] 
5 O LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] rise up [[H6974]] to punish [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] the nations; [[H1471]] show no [[H408]] mercy [[H2603]] to the [[H3605]] wicked [[H205]] traitors. [[H898]] Selah [[H5542]] 
6 They return [[H7725]] in the evening, [[H6153]] snarling [[H1993]] like dogs [[H3611]] and prowling around [[H5437]] the city. [[H5892]] 
7 See what [[H2009]] they spew [[H5042]] from their mouths— [[H6310]] sharp words [[H2719]] from their lips: [[H8193]] “For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] can hear us?” [[H8085]] 
8 But You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] laugh [[H7832]] at them;  You scoff [[H3932]] at all [[H3605]] the nations. [[H1471]] 
9 I will keep watch [[H8104]] for You, [[H413]] O my strength; [[H5797]] for You, [[H3588]] O God, [[H430]] are my fortress. [[H4869]] 
10 My God [[H430]] of loving devotion [[H2617]] will come to meet me; [[H6923]] God [[H430]] will let me stare down [[H7200]] my foes. [[H8324]] 
11 Do not [[H408]] kill them, [[H2026]] or [[H6435]] my people [[H5971]] will forget. [[H7911]] Scatter them [[H5128]] by Your power, [[H2428]] and bring them down, [[H3381]] O Lord, [[H136]] our shield. [[H4043]] 
12 By the sins [[H2403]] of their mouths [[H6310]] and the words [[H1697]] of their lips, [[H8193]] let them be trapped [[H3920]] in their pride, [[H1347]] in the curses [[H423]] and lies [[H3585]] they utter. [[H5608]] 
13 Consume [[H3615]] [them] in wrath; [[H2534]] consume [[H3615]] them till they are no more, [[H369]] so it may be known [[H3045]] to the ends [[H657]] of the earth [[H776]] that [[H3588]] God [[H430]] rules [[H4910]] over Jacob. [[H3290]] Selah [[H5542]] 
14 They return [[H7725]] in the evening, [[H6153]] snarling [[H1993]] like dogs [[H3611]] and prowling around [[H5437]] the city. [[H5892]] 
15 They [[H1992]] scavenge [[H5128]] for food, [[H398]] and growl [[H3885]] if [[H518]] they are not [[H3808]] satisfied. [[H7646]] 
16 But I [[H589]] will sing [[H7891]] of Your strength [[H5797]] and proclaim [[H7442]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] in the morning. [[H1242]] For [[H3588]] You are [[H1961]] my fortress, [[H4869]] my refuge [[H4498]] in times [[H3117]] of trouble. [[H6862]] 
17 To You, [[H413]] O my strength, [[H5797]] I sing praises, [[H2167]] for [[H3588]] You, O God, [[H430]] are my fortress, [[H4869]] my God [[H430]] of loving devotion. [[H2617]]
