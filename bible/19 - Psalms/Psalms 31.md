# Psalms 31
[[Psalms 30|←]] • [[Psalms 32|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] In You,  O LORD, [[H3068]] I take refuge; [[H2620]] let me never [[H408]] be put to shame; [[H954]] save me [[H6403]] by Your righteousness. [[H6666]] 
2 Incline [[H5186]] Your ear [[H241]] to me; [[H413]] come quickly [[H4120]] to my rescue. [[H5337]] Be [[H1961]] my  rock [[H6697]] of refuge, [[H4581]] the stronghold [[H1004]] of my deliverance. [[H3467]] 
3 For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are my rock [[H5553]] and my fortress; [[H4686]] lead [[H5148]] and guide me [[H5095]] for the sake of [[H4616]] Your name. [[H8034]] 
4 You will free me [[H3318]] from the net [[H7568]] laid for me, [[H2934]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are my refuge. [[H4581]] 
5 Into Your hands [[H3027]] I commit [[H6485]] my spirit; [[H7307]] You have redeemed me, [[H6299]] O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H410]] of truth. [[H571]] 
6 I hate [[H8130]] those who cling [[H8104]] to worthless idols, [[H1892]] but in [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] I [[H589]] trust. [[H982]] 
7 I will be glad [[H1523]] and rejoice [[H8055]] in Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] for [[H834]] You have seen [[H7200]] my affliction; [[H6040]] You have known [[H3045]] the anguish [[H6869]] of my soul. [[H5315]] 
8 You have not [[H3808]] delivered me [[H5462]] to [[H3027]] the enemy; [[H341]] You have set [[H5975]] my feet [[H7272]] in the open. [[H4800]] 
9 Be merciful to me, [[H2603]] O LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I am in distress; [[H6887]] my eyes [[H5869]] fail [[H6244]] from sorrow, [[H3708]] my soul [[H5315]] and body as well. [[H990]] 
10 For [[H3588]] my life [[H2416]] is consumed [[H3615]] with grief [[H3015]] and my years [[H8141]] with groaning; [[H585]] my iniquity [[H5771]] has drained [[H3782]] my strength [[H3581]] and my bones [[H6106]] are wasting away. [[H6244]] 
11 Among all [[H3605]] my enemies [[H6887]] I am [[H1961]] a disgrace [[H2781]] and among my neighbors [[H7934]] all the more. [[H3966]] I am dreaded [[H6343]] by my friends— [[H3045]] they flee [[H5074]] when they see [[H7200]] me [[H4480]] on the street. [[H2351]] 
12 I am forgotten [[H7911]] like a dead man, [[H4191]] out of mind. [[H3820]] I am [[H1961]] like a broken [[H6]] vessel. [[H3627]] 
13 For [[H3588]] I hear [[H8085]] the slander [[H1681]] of many; [[H7227]] there is terror [[H4032]] on every side. [[H5439]] They conspire [[H3245]] against me [[H5921]] [and] plot [[H2161]] to take [[H3947]] my life. [[H5315]] 
14 But I [[H589]] trust [[H982]] in You, [[H5921]] O LORD; [[H3068]] I say, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] are my God.” [[H430]] 
15 My times [[H6256]] [are] in Your hands; [[H3027]] deliver me [[H5337]] from [[H3027]] my enemies [[H341]] and from those who pursue me. [[H7291]] 
16 Make Your face [[H6440]] shine [[H215]] on [[H5921]] Your servant; [[H5650]] save me [[H3467]] by Your loving devotion. [[H2617]] 
17 O LORD, [[H3068]] let me not [[H408]] be ashamed, [[H954]] for [[H3588]] I have called on You. [[H7121]] Let the wicked [[H7563]] be put to shame; [[H954]] let them lie silent [[H1826]] in Sheol. [[H7585]] 
18 May lying [[H8267]] lips [[H8193]] be silenced, [[H481]] which speak [[H1696]] with arrogance [[H6277]] against [[H5921]] the righteous, [[H6662]] full of pride [[H1346]] and contempt. [[H937]] 
19 How [[H4100]] great [[H7227]] is Your goodness [[H2898]] which [[H834]] You have laid up [[H6845]] for those who fear You, [[H3373]] and bestowed [[H6466]] on those who take refuge [[H2620]] in You  in the sight of [[H5048]] the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]] 
20 You hide them [[H5641]] in the secret place [[H5643]] of Your presence [[H6440]] from the schemes [[H7407]] of men. [[H376]] You conceal them [[H6845]] in Your shelter [[H5521]] from accusing [[H7379]] tongues. [[H3956]] 
21 Blessed [[H1288]] be the LORD, [[H3069]] for [[H3588]] He has shown [[H6381]] me  His loving devotion [[H2617]] in a city [[H5892]] under siege. [[H4692]] 
22 In my alarm [[H2648]] I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] “I am cut off [[H1629]] from [[H5048]] Your sight!” [[H5869]] But [[H403]] You heard [[H8085]] my plea [[H6963]] for mercy [[H8469]] when I called to You [[H413]] for help. [[H7768]] 
23 Love [[H157]] the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] His saints. [[H2623]] The LORD [[H3068]] preserves [[H5341]] the faithful, [[H539]] but fully [[H5921]] repays [[H7999]] the arrogant. [[H6213]] 
24 Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous, [[H553]] all [[H3605]] you who hope [[H3176]] in the LORD. [[H3068]]
