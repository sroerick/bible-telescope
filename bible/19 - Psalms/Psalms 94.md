# Psalms 94
[[Psalms 93|←]] • [[Psalms 95|→]]
1 O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H410]] of vengeance, [[H5360]] O God [[H410]] of vengeance, [[H5360]] shine forth. [[H3313]] 
2 Rise up, [[H5375]] O Judge [[H8199]] of the earth; [[H776]] render [[H7725]] a reward [[H1576]] to [[H5921]] the proud. [[H1343]] 
3 How long [[H5704]] will the wicked, [[H7563]] O LORD, [[H3068]] how long [[H5704]] will the wicked [[H7563]] exult? [[H5937]] 
4 They pour out [[H5042]] arrogant [[H6277]] words; [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] boast. [[H559]] 
5 They crush [[H1792]] Your people, [[H5971]] O LORD; [[H3068]] they oppress [[H6031]] Your heritage. [[H5159]] 
6 They kill [[H2026]] the widow [[H490]] and the foreigner; [[H1616]] they murder [[H7523]] the fatherless. [[H3490]] 
7 They say, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3050]] does not [[H3808]] see; [[H7200]] the God [[H430]] of Jacob [[H3290]] pays no heed.” [[H995]] 
8 Take notice, [[H995]] O senseless [[H1197]] among the people! [[H5971]] O fools, [[H3684]] when [[H4970]] will you be wise? [[H7919]] 
9 He who affixed [[H5193]] the ear, [[H241]] can He not [[H3808]] hear? [[H8085]] He who [[H518]] formed [[H3335]] the eye, [[H5869]] can He not [[H3808]] see? [[H5027]] 
10 He who admonishes [[H3256]] the nations, [[H1471]] does He not [[H3808]] discipline? [[H3198]] He who teaches [[H3925]] man, [[H120]] does He [lack] knowledge? [[H1847]] 
11 The LORD [[H3068]] knows [[H3045]] the thoughts [[H4284]] of man, [[H120]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are futile. [[H1892]] 
12 Blessed [[H835]] [is] the man [[H1397]] You discipline, [[H3256]] O LORD, [[H3050]] and teach [[H3925]] from Your law, [[H8451]] 
13 to grant him relief [[H8252]] from days [[H3117]] of trouble, [[H7451]] until [[H5704]] a pit [[H7845]] is dug [[H3738]] for the wicked. [[H7563]] 
14 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] forsake [[H5203]] His people; [[H5971]] He will never [[H3808]] abandon [[H5800]] His heritage. [[H5159]] 
15 Surely [[H3588]] judgment [[H6664]] will again [[H7725]] be righteous, [[H4941]] and all [[H3605]] the upright [[H3477]] in heart [[H3820]] will follow it. [[H310]] 
16 Who [[H4310]] will rise up [[H6965]] for me  against [[H5973]] the wicked? [[H7489]] Who [[H4310]] will stand [[H3320]] for me  against [[H5973]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity? [[H205]] 
17 Unless [[H3884]] the LORD [[H3068]] had been my helper, [[H5833]] I [[H5315]] would soon [[H4592]] have dwelt in the abode [[H7931]] of silence. [[H1745]] 
18 If [[H518]] I say, [[H559]] “My foot [[H7272]] is slipping,” [[H4131]] Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] O LORD, [[H3068]] will support me. [[H5582]] 
19 When anxiety [[H8312]] abounds [[H7230]] within me, [[H7130]] Your comforts [[H8575]] delight [[H8173]] my soul. [[H5315]] 
20 Can a corrupt [[H1942]] throne [[H3678]] be Your ally— [[H2266]] one devising [[H3335]] mischief [[H5999]] by [[H5921]] decree? [[H2706]] 
21 They band together [[H1413]] against [[H5921]] the righteous [[H6662]] and condemn [[H7561]] the innocent [[H5355]] to death. [[H1818]] 
22 But the LORD [[H3068]] has been [[H1961]] my stronghold, [[H4869]] and my God [[H430]] is my rock [[H6697]] of refuge. [[H4268]] 
23 He will bring [[H7725]] upon them [[H5921]] their own iniquity [[H205]] and destroy them [[H6789]] for their wickedness. [[H7451]] The LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] will destroy them. [[H6789]]
