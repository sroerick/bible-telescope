# Psalms 113
[[Psalms 112|←]] • [[Psalms 114|→]]
1 Hallelujah! [[H1984]] Give praise, [[H1984]] O servants [[H5650]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] praise [[H1984]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
2 Blessed [[H1288]] be [[H1961]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] both now [[H6258]] and forevermore. [[H5704]] 
3 From the rising [[H4217]] to [[H5704]] the setting [[H3996]] of the sun, [[H8121]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [is] praised. [[H1984]] 
4 The LORD [[H3068]] is exalted [[H7311]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H1471]] His glory [[H3519]] above [[H5921]] the heavens. [[H8064]] 
5 Who [[H4310]] is like the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] the One enthroned [[H3427]] on high? [[H1361]] 
6 He humbles Himself [[H8213]] to behold [[H7200]] the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth. [[H776]] 
7 He raises [[H6965]] the poor [[H1800]] from the dust [[H6083]] and lifts [[H7311]] the needy [[H34]] from the dump [[H830]] 
8 to seat [[H3427]] them with [[H5973]] nobles, [[H5081]] with [[H5973]] the princes [[H5081]] of His people. [[H5971]] 
9 He settles [[H3427]] the barren woman [[H6135]] in her home, [[H1004]] as a joyful [[H8056]] mother [[H517]] to her children. [[H1121]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
