# Psalms 128
[[Psalms 127|←]] • [[Psalms 129|→]]
1 A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] Blessed [[H835]] are all [[H3605]] who fear [[H3373]] the LORD, [[H3069]] who walk [[H1980]] in His ways! [[H1870]] 
2 For [[H3588]] when you eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H3709]] of your labor, [[H3018]] blessings [[H835]] and prosperity [[H2896]] will be yours.  
3 Your wife [[H802]] will be like a fruitful [[H6509]] vine [[H1612]] [flourishing] within [[H3411]] your house, [[H1004]] your sons [[H1121]] like olive [[H2132]] shoots [[H8363]] [sitting] around [[H5439]] your table. [[H7979]] 
4 In this way [[H3651]] indeed [[H2009]] shall blessing come [[H1288]] to the man [[H1397]] who fears [[H3373]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
5 May the LORD [[H3068]] bless you [[H1288]] from Zion, [[H6726]] that you may see [[H7200]] the prosperity [[H2898]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of your life, [[H2416]] 
6 that you may see [[H7200]] your children’s [[H1121]] children! [[H1121]] Peace [[H7965]] be upon [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]
