# Psalms 9
[[Psalms 8|←]] • [[Psalms 10|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] To [the tune of] “The Death of the Son.” [[H4192]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] I will give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] my heart; [[H3820]] I will recount [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] Your wonders. [[H6381]] 
2 I will be glad [[H8055]] and rejoice in You; [[H5970]] I will sing praise [[H2167]] to Your name, [[H8034]] O Most High. [[H5945]] 
3 When my enemies [[H341]] retreat, [[H7725]] they stumble [[H3782]] and perish [[H6]] before You. [[H6440]] 
4 For [[H3588]] You have upheld [[H6213]] my just [[H4941]] cause; [[H1779]] You sit [[H3427]] on Your throne [[H3678]] judging [[H8199]] righteously. [[H6664]] 
5 You have rebuked [[H1605]] the nations; [[H1471]] You have destroyed [[H6]] the wicked; [[H7563]] You have erased [[H4229]] their name [[H8034]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]] 
6 The enemy [[H341]] has come to eternal [[H5331]] ruin, [[H2723]] and You have uprooted [[H5428]] their cities; [[H5892]] the very memory [[H2143]] of them [[H1992]] has vanished. [[H6]] 
7 But the LORD [[H3068]] abides [[H3427]] forever; [[H5769]] He has established [[H3559]] His throne [[H3678]] for judgment. [[H4941]] 
8 He [[H1931]] judges [[H8199]] the world [[H8398]] with justice; [[H6664]] He will govern [[H1777]] the people [[H3816]] with equity. [[H4339]] 
9 The LORD [[H3068]] is [[H1961]] a refuge [[H4869]] for the oppressed, [[H1790]] a stronghold [[H4869]] in times [[H6256]] of trouble. [[H6869]] 
10 Those who know [[H3045]] Your name [[H8034]] will trust [[H982]] in You,  for [[H3588]] You, O LORD, [[H3068]] have not [[H3808]] abandoned [[H5800]] those who seek You. [[H1875]] 
11 Sing praises [[H2167]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] who dwells [[H3427]] in Zion; [[H6726]] proclaim [[H5046]] His deeds [[H5949]] among the nations. [[H5971]] 
12 For [[H3588]] the Avenger [[H1875]] of bloodshed [[H1818]] remembers; [[H2142]] He does not ignore [[H7911]] the cry [[H6818]] of the afflicted. [[H6041]] 
13 Be merciful to me, [[H2603]] O LORD; [[H3068]] see [[H7200]] how my enemies [[H8130]] afflict me! [[H6040]] Snatch me [[H7311]] from the gates [[H8179]] of death, [[H4194]] 
14 that [[H4616]] I may declare [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] Your praises— [[H8416]] that within the gates [[H8179]] of Daughter [[H1323]] Zion [[H6726]] I may rejoice [[H1523]] in Your salvation. [[H3444]] 
15 The nations [[H1471]] have fallen [[H2883]] into a pit [[H7845]] of their making; [[H6213]] their feet [[H7272]] are snared [[H3920]] in the net [[H7568]] they have hidden. [[H2934]] 
16 The LORD [[H3068]] is known [[H3045]] by the justice [[H4941]] He brings; [[H6213]] the wicked [[H7563]] are ensnared [[H5367]] by the work [[H6467]] of their hands. [[H3709]] Higgaion [[H1902]] Selah [[H5542]] 
17 The wicked [[H7563]] will return [[H7725]] to Sheol— [[H7585]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] who forget [[H7913]] God. [[H430]] 
18 For [[H3588]] the needy [[H34]] {will} not [[H3808]] always [[H5331]] be forgotten; [[H7911]] nor the hope [[H8615]] of the oppressed [[H6035]] forever [[H5703]] dashed. [[H6]] 
19 Rise up, [[H6965]] O LORD, [[H3069]] let not [[H408]] man [[H376]] prevail; [[H5810]] let the nations [[H1471]] be judged [[H8199]] in [[H5921]] Your presence. [[H6440]] 
20 Lay [[H7896]] terror [[H4172]] upon them, [O LORD]; [[H3069]] let the nations [[H1471]] know [[H3045]] they [[H1992]] are but men. [[H582]] Selah [[H5542]]
