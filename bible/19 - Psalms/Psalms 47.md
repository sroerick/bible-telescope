1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] Clap [[H8628]] your hands, [[H3709]] all you peoples; [[H3605]] shout [[H7321]] unto God [[H430]] with a voice [[H6963]] of triumph. [[H7440]] 
2 How [[H3588]] awesome [is] [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] the Most High, [[H5945]] the great [[H1419]] King [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth! [[H776]] 
3 He subdues [[H1696]] nations [[H5971]] beneath us, [[H8478]] and peoples [[H3816]] under [[H8478]] our feet. [[H7272]] 
4 He chooses [[H977]] our inheritance [[H5159]] for us,  the pride [[H1347]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] whom [[H834]] He loves. [[H157]] Selah [[H5542]] 
5 God [[H430]] has ascended [[H5927]] amid shouts of joy, [[H8643]] the LORD [[H3068]] with the sound [[H6963]] of trumpets. [[H7782]] 
6 Sing praises [[H2167]] to God, [[H430]] sing praises; [[H2167]] sing praises [[H2167]] to our King, [[H4428]] sing praises! [[H2167]] 
7 For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] is King [[H4428]] of all [[H3605]] the earth; [[H776]] sing profound praises to Him. [[H2167]] 
8 God [[H430]] reigns [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] the nations; [[H1471]] God [[H430]] is seated [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] His holy [[H6944]] throne. [[H3678]] 
9 The nobles [[H5081]] of the nations [[H5971]] have assembled [[H622]] as the people [[H5971]] of the God [[H430]] of Abraham; [[H85]] for [[H3588]] the shields [[H4043]] of the earth [[H776]] belong to God; [[H430]] He is highly [[H3966]] exalted. [[H5927]]
