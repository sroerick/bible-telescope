1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] According to [[H5921]] Sheminith. [[H8067]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] Help, [[H3467]] O LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] the godly [[H2623]] are no more; [[H1584]] the faithful [[H539]] have vanished [[H6461]] from among [[H1121]] men. [[H120]] 
2 They lie [[H7723]] to [[H854]] one [[H376]] another; [[H7453]] they speak [[H1696]] with flattering [[H2513]] lips [[H8193]] and a double [[H3820]] heart. [[H3820]] 
3 May the LORD [[H3068]] cut off [[H3772]] all [[H3605]] flattering [[H2513]] lips, [[H8193]] and the tongue [[H3956]] that speaks [[H1696]] proud things. [[H1419]] 
4 They [[H834]] say, [[H559]] “With our tongues [[H3956]] we will prevail. [[H1396]] We own [[H853]] our lips— [[H8193]] who [[H4310]] can be our master?” [[H113]] 
5 “For the cause [[H7701]] of the oppressed [[H6041]] and the groaning [[H603]] of the needy, [[H34]] I will now [[H6258]] arise,” [[H6965]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “I will bring [[H7896]] safety [[H3468]] to him who yearns.” [[H6315]] 
6 The words [[H565]] of the LORD [[H3068]] are flawless, [[H2889]] like silver [[H3701]] refined [[H6884]] in a furnace, [[H5948]] like gold [[H776]] purified [[H2212]] sevenfold. [[H7659]] 
7 You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] will keep us; [[H8104]] You will forever guard us [[H5341]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2098]] generation. [[H1755]] 
8 The wicked [[H7563]] wander [[H1980]] freely, [[H5439]] and vileness [[H2149]] is exalted [[H7311]] among [[H1121]] men. [[H120]]
