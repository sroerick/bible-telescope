# Psalms 18
[[Psalms 17|←]] • [[Psalms 19|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] Of David [[H1732]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] sang [[H1696]] this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on the day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] delivered [[H5337]] him [[H853]] from the hand [[H3709]] of all [[H3605]] his enemies [[H341]] and from the hand [[H3027]] of Saul. [[H7586]] He said: [[H559]] I love You, [[H7355]] O LORD, [[H3068]] my strength. [[H2391]] 
2 The LORD [[H3068]] is my rock, [[H5553]] my fortress, [[H4686]] and my deliverer. [[H6403]] My God [is] [[H410]] my rock, [[H6697]] in whom I take refuge, [[H2620]] my shield, [[H4043]] and the horn [[H7161]] of my salvation, [[H3468]] my stronghold. [[H4869]] 
3 I will call upon [[H7121]] the LORD, [[H3068]] [who is worthy] to be praised; [[H1984]] so shall I be saved [[H3467]] from [[H4480]] my enemies. [[H341]] 
4 The cords [[H2256]] of death [[H4194]] encompassed me; [[H661]] the torrents [[H5158]] of chaos [[H1100]] overwhelmed me. [[H1204]] 
5 The cords [[H2256]] of Sheol [[H7585]] entangled me; [[H5437]] the snares [[H4170]] of death [[H4194]] confronted me. [[H6923]] 
6 In my distress [[H6862]] I called [[H7121]] upon  the LORD [[H3068]] and I cried to [[H413]] my God [[H430]] for help. [[H7768]] From His temple [[H1964]] He heard [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] and my cry for His help [[H7775]] reached [[H935]] His ears. [[H241]] 
7 Then the earth [[H776]] shook [[H1607]] and quaked, [[H7493]] and the foundations [[H4146]] of the mountains [[H2022]] trembled; [[H7264]] they were shaken [[H1607]] because [[H3588]] He burned with anger. [[H2734]] 
8 Smoke [[H6227]] rose [[H5927]] from His nostrils, [[H639]] and consuming [[H398]] fire [[H784]] came from [[H4480]] His mouth; [[H6310]] glowing coals [[H1513]] flamed forth. [[H1197]] 
9 He parted [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] and came down [[H3381]] with dark clouds [[H6205]] was under [[H8478]] His feet. [[H7272]] 
10 He mounted [[H7392]] a cherub [[H3742]] and flew; [[H5774]] He soared [[H1675]] on [[H5921]] the wings [[H3671]] of the wind. [[H7307]] 
11 He made [[H7896]] darkness [[H2822]] His hiding place, [[H5643]] [and] storm [[H4325]] clouds [[H5645]] a canopy [[H5521]] around Him. [[H5439]] 
12 From the brightness [[H5051]] of His presence, [[H5048]] His clouds [[H5645]] advanced— [[H5674]] hailstones [[H1259]] and coals [[H1513]] of fire. [[H784]] 
13 The LORD [[H3068]] thundered [[H7481]] from heaven; [[H8064]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Most High [[H5945]] resounded— [[H5414]] hailstones [[H1259]] and coals [[H1513]] of fire. [[H784]] 
14 He shot [[H7971]] His arrows [[H2671]] and scattered [the foes]; [[H6327]] He hurled [[H7232]] lightning [[H1300]] and routed them. [[H2000]] 
15 The channels [[H650]] of the sea [[H4325]] appeared, [[H7200]] the foundations [[H4146]] of the world [[H8398]] were exposed, [[H1540]] at Your rebuke, [[H1606]] O LORD, [[H3068]] at the blast [[H5397]] of the breath [[H7307]] of Your nostrils. [[H639]] 
16 He reached [[H7971]] from on high [[H4791]] and took hold of me; [[H3947]] He drew me [[H4871]] out of deep [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]] 
17 He rescued me [[H5337]] from [[H4480]] my powerful [[H5794]] enemy [[H341]] and from foes [[H8130]] too mighty for me. [[H553]] 
18 They confronted me [[H6923]] in my day [[H3117]] of calamity, [[H343]] but the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] my support. [[H4937]] 
19 He brought me out [[H3318]] into the open; [[H4800]] He rescued me [[H2502]] because [[H3588]] He delighted in me. [[H2654]] 
20 The LORD [[H3068]] has rewarded me [[H1580]] according to my righteousness; [[H6664]] He has repaid me [[H7725]] according to the cleanness [[H1252]] of my hands. [[H3027]] 
21 For [[H3588]] I have kept [[H8104]] the ways [[H1870]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and have not [[H3808]] wickedly departed [[H7561]] from my God. [[H430]] 
22 For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] His ordinances [are] [[H4941]] before me; [[H5048]] I have not [[H3808]] disregarded [[H5493]] His statutes. [[H2708]] 
23 And I [[H1961]] have been blameless [[H8549]] before Him [[H5973]] and kept myself [[H8104]] from iniquity. [[H5771]] 
24 So the LORD [[H3068]] has repaid me [[H7725]] according to my righteousness, [[H6664]] according to the cleanness [[H1252]] of my hands [[H3027]] in [[H5048]] His sight. [[H5869]] 
25 To [[H5973]] the faithful [[H2623]] You show Yourself faithful, [[H2616]] to [[H5973]] the blameless [[H8549]] You show Yourself blameless, [[H8552]] 
26 to [[H5973]] the pure [[H1305]] You show Yourself pure, [[H1305]] but to [[H5973]] the crooked [[H6141]] You show Yourself shrewd. [[H6617]] 
27 For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] save [[H3467]] an afflicted [[H6041]] people, [[H5971]] but You humble [[H8213]] those with haughty [[H7311]] eyes. [[H5869]] 
28 For [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] light [[H215]] my lamp; [[H5216]] my God [[H430]] enlightens [[H5050]] my darkness. [[H2822]] 
29 For [[H3588]] in You  I can charge [[H7323]] an army, [[H1416]] and with my God [[H430]] I can scale [[H1801]] a wall. [[H7791]] 
30 [As for] God, [[H410]] His way [[H1870]] is perfect; [[H8549]] the word [[H565]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is flawless. [[H6884]] He [[H1931]] is a shield [[H4043]] to all [[H3605]] who take refuge [[H2620]] in Him.  
31 For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] is God [[H433]] besides [[H1107]] the LORD? [[H3068]] And who [[H4310]] [is] the rock [[H6697]] except [[H2108]] our God? [[H430]] 
32 [It is] God [[H410]] who arms me [[H247]] with strength [[H2428]] and makes [[H5414]] my way [[H1870]] blameless. [[H8549]] 
33 He makes [[H7737]] my feet [[H7272]] like the feet of a deer [[H355]] and stations me [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] the heights. [[H1116]] 
34 He trains [[H3925]] my hands [[H3027]] for battle; [[H4421]] my arms [[H2220]] can bend [[H5181]] a bow [[H7198]] of bronze. [[H5154]] 
35 You have given [[H5414]] me  Your shield [[H4043]] of salvation; [[H3468]] Your right hand [[H3225]] upholds me, [[H5582]] and Your gentleness [[H6037]] exalts me. [[H7235]] 
36 You broaden [[H7337]] the path [[H6806]] beneath me [[H8478]] so that my ankles [[H7166]] do not [[H3808]] give way. [[H4571]] 
37 I pursued [[H7291]] my enemies [[H341]] and overtook them; [[H5381]] I did not [[H3808]] turn back [[H7725]] until [[H5704]] they were consumed. [[H3615]] 
38 I crushed them [[H4272]] so they could not [[H3808]] rise; [[H6965]] they have fallen [[H5307]] under [[H8478]] my feet. [[H7272]] 
39 You have armed me [[H247]] with strength [[H2428]] for battle; [[H4421]] You have subdued [[H3766]] my foes [[H6965]] beneath me. [[H8478]] 
40 You have made [[H5414]] my enemies [[H341]] retreat [[H6203]] before me;  I put an end [[H6789]] to those who hated me. [[H8130]] 
41 They cried for help, [[H7768]] but [there was] no one [[H369]] to save them— [[H3467]] to [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but He did not [[H3808]] answer. [[H6030]] 
42 I ground them [[H7833]] as dust [[H6083]] in [[H5921]] the face of [[H6440]] the wind; [[H7307]] I trampled them [[H7324]] like mud [[H2916]] in the streets. [[H2351]] 
43 You have delivered me [[H6403]] from the strife [[H7379]] of the people; [[H5971]] You have made me [[H7760]] the head [[H7218]] of nations; [[H1471]] a people [[H5971]] I had not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] shall serve me. [[H5647]] 
44 When they hear me, [[H8088]] they obey me; [[H8085]] foreigners [[H1121]] cower [[H3584]] before me.  
45 Foreigners [[H1121]] lose heart [[H5034]] and come trembling [[H2727]] from their strongholds. [[H4526]] 
46 The LORD [[H3068]] lives! [[H2416]] Blessed be [[H1288]] my rock! [[H6697]] And {may} the God [[H433]] of my salvation [[H3468]] be exalted— [[H7311]] 
47 the God [[H410]] who avenges [[H5414]] me  and subdues [[H1696]] nations [[H5971]] beneath me, [[H8478]] 
48 who delivers [[H6403]] me from [[H4480]] my enemies. [[H341]] You exalt me [[H7311]] above my foes; [[H6965]] You rescue me [[H5337]] from violent [[H2555]] men. [[H376]] 
49 Therefore [[H5921]] I will praise You, [[H3034]] O LORD, [[H3068]] among the nations; [[H1471]] I will sing praises [[H2167]] to Your name! [[H8034]] 
50 {He brings}  great [[H2167]] salvation [[H3444]] to His king. [[H4428]] He shows [[H6213]] loving devotion [[H2617]] to His anointed, [[H4899]] to David [[H1732]] and his descendants [[H2233]] forever. [[H5704]]
