[[Psalms 74|←]] • [[Psalms 76|→]]
1 For the choirmaster: [[H5329]] [To the tune of] “Do not Destroy.” [[H516]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]] A Song. [[H7892]] We give thanks [[H3034]] to You,  O God; [[H430]] we give thanks, [[H3034]] for Your name [[H8034]] is near. [[H7138]] The people declare [[H5608]] Your wondrous works. [[H6381]] 
2 “When [[H3588]] I choose [[H3947]] a time, [[H4150]] I [[H589]] will judge [[H8199]] fairly. [[H4339]] 
3 When the earth [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] its dwellers [[H3427]] quake, [[H4127]] it is I [[H595]] who bear up [[H8505]] its pillars. [[H5982]] Selah [[H5542]] 
4 I say [[H559]] to the proud, [[H1984]] ‘Do not [[H408]] boast,’ [[H1984]] and to the wicked, [[H7563]] ‘Do not [[H408]] lift up [[H7311]] your horn. [[H7161]] 
5 Do not [[H408]] lift up [[H7311]] your horn [[H7161]] against heaven [[H4791]] or speak [[H1696]] with an outstretched [[H6277]] neck.’” [[H6677]] 
6 For [[H3588]] exaltation [[H7311]] comes not [[H3808]] from east [[H4161]] or west [[H4628]] or [[H3808]] out of the desert, [[H4057]] 
7 but [[H3588]] it is God [[H430]] who judges; [[H8199]] He brings one down [[H8213]] and exalts [[H7311]] another. [[H2088]] 
8 For [[H3588]] a cup [[H3563]] is in the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] full of [[H4392]] foaming [[H2560]] wine [[H3196]] mixed with spices, [[H4538]] He pours [[H5064]] from it, [[H2088]] and [[H389]] all [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7563]] of the earth [[H776]] drink it down [[H8354]] it to the dregs. [[H8105]] 
9 But I [[H589]] will proclaim it [[H5046]] forever; [[H5769]] I will sing praise [[H2167]] to the God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] 
10 “All [[H3605]] the horns [[H7161]] of the wicked [[H7563]] I will cut off, [[H1438]] but the horns [[H7161]] of the righteous [[H6662]] will be exalted.” [[H7311]]
