# Psalms 146
[[Psalms 145|←]] • [[Psalms 147|→]]
1 Hallelujah! [[H1984]] Praise [[H1984]] the LORD, [[H3068]] O my soul. [[H5315]] 
2 I will praise [[H1984]] the LORD [[H3068]] all my life; [[H2416]] I will sing praises [[H2167]] to my God [[H430]] while I have my being. [[H5750]] 
3 Put not [[H408]] your trust [[H982]] in princes, [[H5081]] in mortal [[H1121]] man, [[H120]] who cannot [[H369]] save. [[H8668]] 
4 When his spirit [[H7307]] departs, [[H3318]] he returns [[H7725]] to the ground; [[H127]] on that [[H1931]] very day [[H3117]] his plans [[H6250]] perish. [[H6]] 
5 Blessed is he [[H835]] whose help [[H5828]] is the God [[H410]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] whose hope [[H7664]] is in [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] 
6 the Maker [[H6213]] of heaven [[H8064]] and earth, [[H776]] the sea, [[H3220]] and everything [[H3605]] in them.  He remains [[H8104]] faithful [[H571]] forever, [[H5769]] 
7 executing [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] for the oppressed, [[H6231]] giving [[H5414]] food [[H3899]] to the hungry. [[H7457]] The LORD [[H3068]] sets [[H5425]] the prisoners {free}, [[H631]] 
8 the LORD [[H3068]] opens [the eyes of] [[H6491]] the blind, [[H5787]] the LORD [[H3068]] lifts [[H2210]] those who are weighed down, [[H3721]] the LORD [[H3068]] loves [[H157]] the righteous. [[H6662]] 
9 The LORD [[H3068]] protects [[H8104]] the sojourners; [[H1616]] He sustains [[H5749]] the fatherless [[H3490]] and the widow, [[H490]] but the ways [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] He frustrates. [[H5791]] 
10 The LORD [[H3068]] reigns forever, [[H4427]] your God, [[H430]] O Zion, [[H6726]] for all generations. [[H1755]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
