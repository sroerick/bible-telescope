# Psalms 39
[[Psalms 38|←]] • [[Psalms 40|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] For Jeduthun. [[H3038]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] I said, [[H559]] “I will watch [[H8104]] my ways [[H1870]] so that I will not sin [[H2398]] with my tongue; [[H3956]] I will guard [[H8104]] my mouth [[H6310]] with a muzzle [[H4269]] as [[H5704]] long as the wicked [[H7563]] are present.” [[H5048]] 
2 I was speechless [[H481]] and still; [[H1747]] I held my peace, [[H2814]] [even] from good, [[H2896]] and my sorrow [[H3511]] was stirred. [[H5916]] 
3 My heart [[H3820]] grew hot [[H2552]] within me; [[H7130]] as I mused, [[H1901]] the fire [[H784]] burned. [[H1197]] [Then] I spoke [[H1696]] with my tongue: [[H3956]] 
4 “Show me, [[H3045]] O LORD, [[H3068]] my end [[H7093]] and the measure [[H4060]] of my days. [[H3117]] Let me know [[H3045]] how [[H4100]] fleeting [[H2310]] my life is. [[H589]] 
5 You, indeed, [[H2009]] have made [[H5414]] my days [[H3117]] [as] handbreadths, [[H2947]] and my lifetime [[H2465]] as nothing [[H369]] before You. [[H5048]] Truly [[H389]] each [[H3605]] man [[H120]] at his best [[H5324]] exists as but a breath. [[H1892]] Selah [[H5542]] 
6 Surely [[H389]] every man [[H376]] goes about [[H1980]] like a phantom; [[H6754]] surely [[H389]] he bustles [[H1993]] in vain; [[H1892]] he heaps up [riches] [[H6651]] not [[H3808]] knowing [[H3045]] who [[H4310]] will haul them away. [[H622]] 
7 Now, [[H6258]] Lord, [[H136]] for what [[H4100]] do I wait? [[H6960]] My hope is [[H8431]] in  You. [[H1931]] 
8 Deliver me [[H5337]] from all [[H3605]] my transgressions; [[H6588]] do not [[H408]] make me [[H7760]] the reproach [[H2781]] of fools. [[H5036]] 
9 I have become mute; [[H481]] I do not [[H3808]] open [[H6605]] my mouth [[H6310]] because [[H3588]] it is You [[H859]] who have done it. [[H6213]] 
10 Remove [[H5493]] Your scourge [[H5061]] from me; [[H5921]] I [[H589]] am perishing [[H3615]] by the force [[H8409]] of Your hand. [[H3027]] 
11 You discipline [[H3256]] and correct [[H8433]] a man [[H376]] for [[H5921]] his iniquity, [[H5771]] consuming [[H4529]] like a moth [[H6211]] what he holds dear; [[H2530]] surely [[H389]] each [[H3605]] man [[H120]] [is] but a vapor. [[H1892]] Selah [[H5542]] 
12 Hear [[H8085]] my prayer, [[H8605]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and give ear [[H238]] to my cry for help; [[H7775]] do not [[H408]] be deaf [[H2790]] to [[H413]] my weeping. [[H1832]] For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am a foreigner [[H1616]] dwelling with You, [[H5973]] a sojourner [[H8453]] like all [[H3605]] my fathers. [[H1]] 
13 Turn Your gaze [[H8159]] away from me, [[H4480]] that I may again be cheered [[H1082]] before [[H2962]] I depart [[H1980]] and am no more.” [[H369]]
