# Psalms 10
[[Psalms 9|←]] • [[Psalms 11|→]]
1 Why, [[H4100]] O LORD, [[H3068]] do You stand [[H5975]] far off? [[H7350]] Why do You hide [[H5956]] in times [[H6256]] of trouble? [[H6869]] 
2 In pride [[H1346]] the wicked [[H7563]] pursue [[H1814]] the needy; [[H6041]] let them be caught [[H8610]] in the schemes [[H4209]] they devise. [[H2803]] 
3 For [[H3588]] the wicked man [[H7563]] boasts [[H1984]] in [[H5921]] the cravings [[H8378]] of his heart; [[H5315]] he blesses [[H1288]] the greedy [[H1214]] and reviles [[H5006]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
4 In his pride [[H1363]] the wicked [man] [[H7563]] does not [[H1077]] seek [Him]; [[H1875]] in all [[H3605]] his schemes [[H4209]] there is no [[H369]] God. [[H430]] 
5 He is secure [[H2342]] in his ways [[H1870]] at all times; [[H3605]] Your lofty [[H4791]] judgments [[H4941]] are far from him; [[H5048]] he sneers [[H6315]] at all [[H3605]] his foes. [[H6887]] 
6 He says [[H559]] to himself, [[H3820]] “I shall not [[H1077]] be moved; [[H4131]] from age [[H1755]] to age [[H1755]] I am free [[H3808]] of distress.” [[H7451]] 
7 His mouth [[H6310]] is full of [[H4390]] cursing, [[H423]] deceit, [[H4820]] and violence; [[H8496]] trouble [[H5999]] and malice [[H205]] are under [[H8478]] his tongue. [[H3956]] 
8 He lies [[H3427]] in wait [[H3993]] near the villages; [[H2691]] in ambush [[H4565]] he slays [[H2026]] the innocent; [[H5355]] his eyes [[H5869]] watch in stealth [[H6845]] for the helpless. [[H2489]] 
9 He lies in wait [[H693]] like a lion [[H738]] in a thicket; [[H5520]] he lurks [[H693]] to seize [[H2414]] the oppressed; [[H6041]] he catches [[H2414]] the lowly [[H6041]] in his dragnet. [[H4900]] 
10 They are crushed [[H1794]] and beaten down; [[H7817]] the hapless [[H2489]] fall prey [[H5307]] to his strength. [[H6099]] 
11 He says [[H559]] to himself, [[H3820]] “God [[H410]] has forgotten; [[H7911]] He hides [[H5641]] His face [[H6440]] and never [[H1077]] sees.” [[H7200]] 
12 Arise, [[H6965]] O LORD! [[H3068]] Lift up [[H5375]] Your hand, [[H3027]] O God. [[H410]] Do not [[H408]] forget [[H7911]] the helpless. [[H6041]] 
13 Why [[H5921]] has the wicked man [[H7563]] renounced [[H5006]] God? [[H430]] He says [[H559]] to himself, [[H3820]] “You will never [[H3808]] call [me] to account.” [[H1875]] 
14 But [[H3588]] You [[H859]] have regarded [[H7200]] trouble [[H5999]] and grief; [[H3708]] You consider it [[H5027]] to take [[H5414]] in hand. [[H3027]] The victim [[H2489]] entrusts himself [[H5800]] to You; [[H5921]] You [[H859]] are [[H1961]] the helper [[H5826]] of the fatherless. [[H3490]] 
15 Break [[H7665]] the arm [[H2220]] of the wicked [[H7563]] and evildoer; [[H7451]] call his wickedness [[H7562]] into account [[H1875]] until none is left [[H1077]] to find. [[H4672]] 
16 The LORD [[H3068]] is King [[H4428]] forever [[H5769]] and ever; [[H5703]] the nations [[H1471]] will vanish [[H6]] from His land. [[H776]] 
17 You have heard, [[H8085]] O LORD, [[H3068]] the desire [[H8378]] of the humble; [[H6035]] You will strengthen [[H3559]] their hearts. [[H3820]] You will incline [[H7181]] Your ear, [[H241]] 
18 to vindicate [[H8199]] the fatherless [[H3490]] and oppressed, [[H1790]] that the men [[H376]] of [[H4480]] the earth [[H776]] may strike terror [[H6206]] no more. [[H1077]]
