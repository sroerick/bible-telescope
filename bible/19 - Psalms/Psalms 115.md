# Psalms 115
[[Psalms 114|←]] • [[Psalms 116|→]]
1 Not [[H3808]] to us,  O LORD, [[H3068]] not to us, [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] to Your name [[H8034]] be [[H5414]] the glory, [[H3519]] because of [[H5921]] Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] because [[H5921]] of Your faithfulness. [[H571]] 
2 Why [[H4100]] should the nations [[H1471]] say, [[H559]] “Where [[H346]] is their God?” [[H430]] 
3 Our God [[H430]] is in heaven [[H8064]] and does [[H6213]] as [[H3605]] He pleases. [[H2654]] 
4 Their idols [[H6091]] are silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] made [[H4639]] by the hands [[H3027]] of men. [[H120]] 
5 They have mouths, [[H6310]] but cannot [[H3808]] speak; [[H1696]] they have eyes, [[H5869]] but cannot [[H3808]] see; [[H7200]] 
6 they have ears, [[H241]] but cannot [[H3808]] hear; [[H8085]] they have noses, [[H639]] but cannot [[H3808]] smell; [[H7306]] 
7 they have hands, [[H3027]] but cannot [[H3808]] feel; [[H4184]] they have feet, [[H7272]] but cannot [[H3808]] walk. [[H1980]] They cannot [[H3808]] utter a sound [[H1897]] with their throats. [[H1627]] 
8 Those who make them [[H6213]] will be [[H1961]] like them, [[H3644]] as will all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] trust [[H982]] in them.  
9 O Israel, [[H3478]] trust [[H982]] in the LORD! [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] is their help [[H5828]] and shield. [[H4043]] 
10 O house [[H1004]] of Aaron, [[H175]] trust [[H982]] in the LORD! [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] is their help [[H5828]] and shield. [[H4043]] 
11 You who fear [[H3373]] the LORD, [[H3068]] trust [[H982]] in the LORD! [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] is their help [[H5828]] and shield. [[H4043]] 
12 The LORD [[H3068]] is mindful of us; [[H2142]] He will bless us. [[H1288]] He will bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] He will bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Aaron; [[H175]] 
13 He will bless [[H1288]] those who fear [[H3373]] the LORD— [[H3068]] small [[H6996]] and [[H5973]] great alike. [[H1419]] 
14 May the LORD [[H3068]] give you increase, [[H3254]] both you [[H5921]] and [[H5921]] your children. [[H1121]] 
15 May you [[H859]] be blessed [[H1288]] by the LORD, [[H3068]] the Maker [[H6213]] of heaven [[H8064]] and earth. [[H776]] 
16 The highest heavens [[H8064]] belong to the LORD, [[H3068]] but the earth [[H776]] He has given [[H5414]] to mankind. [[H120]] 
17 It is not [[H3808]] the dead [[H4191]] who praise [[H1984]] the LORD, [[H3050]] nor [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] who descend [[H3381]] into silence. [[H1745]] 
18 But it is we [[H587]] who will bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3050]] both now [[H6258]] and forevermore. [[H5704]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
