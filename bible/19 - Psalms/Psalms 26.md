# Psalms 26
[[Psalms 25|←]] • [[Psalms 27|→]]
1 Of David. [[H1732]] Vindicate me, [[H8199]] O LORD! [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have walked [[H1980]] with integrity; [[H8537]] I have trusted [[H982]] in the LORD [[H3068]] without [[H3808]] wavering. [[H4571]] 
2 Test me, [[H974]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and try me; [[H5254]] examine [[H6884]] my heart [[H3629]] and mind. [[H3820]] 
3 For [[H3588]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] is before [[H5048]] my eyes, [[H5869]] and I have walked [[H1980]] in Your truth. [[H571]] 
4 I do not [[H3808]] sit [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] deceitful [[H7723]] men, [[H4962]] nor [[H3808]] keep company [[H935]] with [[H5973]] hypocrites. [[H5956]] 
5 I hate [[H8130]] the mob [[H6951]] of evildoers, [[H7489]] and refuse [[H3808]] to sit [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] the wicked. [[H7563]] 
6 I wash [[H7364]] my hands [[H3709]] in innocence [[H5356]] that I may come near [[H5437]] Your altar, [[H4196]] O LORD, [[H3068]] 
7 to raise [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] in thanksgiving [[H8426]] and declare [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] Your wonderful works. [[H6381]] 
8 O LORD, [[H3068]] I love [[H157]] the house [[H1004]] where You dwell, [[H4583]] the place [[H4725]] where Your glory [[H3519]] resides. [[H4908]] 
9 Do not [[H408]] take [[H622]] my soul [[H5315]] away with [[H5973]] sinners, [[H2400]] or my life [[H2416]] with [[H5973]] men [[H376]] of bloodshed, [[H1818]] 
10 in whose [[H834]] hands [[H3027]] are wicked schemes, [[H2154]] whose right hands [[H3225]] are full [[H4390]] of bribes. [[H7810]] 
11 But I [[H589]] will walk [[H1980]] with integrity; [[H8537]] redeem me [[H6299]] and be merciful to me. [[H2603]] 
12 My feet [[H7272]] stand [[H5975]] on level ground; [[H4334]] in the congregations [[H4721]] I will bless [[H1288]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
