[[Psalms 28|←]] • [[Psalms 30|→]]
1 A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] Ascribe [[H3051]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] O heavenly beings, [[H1121]] ascribe [[H3051]] to the LORD [[H3068]] glory [[H3519]] and strength. [[H5797]] 
2 Ascribe [[H3051]] to the LORD [[H3068]] the glory [[H3519]] due His name; [[H8034]] worship [[H7812]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the splendor [[H1927]] of His holiness. [[H6944]] 
3 The voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is over [[H5921]] the waters; [[H4325]] the God [[H410]] of glory [[H3519]] thunders; [[H7481]] the LORD [[H3068]] [is heard] over [[H5921]] many [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]] 
4 The voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [is] powerful; [[H3581]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [is] majestic. [[H1926]] 
5 The voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] breaks [[H7665]] the cedars; [[H730]] the LORD [[H3068]] shatters [[H7665]] the cedars [[H730]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]] 
6 He makes Lebanon [[H3844]] skip [[H7540]] like [[H3644]] a calf, [[H5695]] and Sirion [[H8303]] like [[H3644]] a young [[H1121]] wild ox. [[H7214]] 
7 The voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] strikes [[H2672]] with flames [[H3852]] of fire. [[H784]] 
8 The voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] shakes [[H2342]] the desert; [[H4057]] the LORD [[H3068]] shakes [[H2342]] the Desert [[H4057]] of Kadesh. [[H6946]] 
9 The voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] twists [[H2342]] the oaks [[H355]] and strips the forests [[H3295]] bare. [[H2834]] And in His temple [[H1964]] all [[H3605]] cry, [[H559]] “Glory!” [[H3519]] 
10 The LORD [[H3068]] sits enthroned [[H3427]] over the flood; [[H3999]] the LORD [[H3068]] is enthroned [[H3427]] as King [[H4428]] forever. [[H5769]] 
11 The LORD [[H3068]] gives [[H5414]] His people [[H5971]] strength; [[H5797]] the LORD [[H3068]] blesses [[H1288]] His people [[H5971]] with peace. [[H7965]]
