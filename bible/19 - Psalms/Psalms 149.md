# Psalms 149
[[Psalms 148|←]] • [[Psalms 150|→]]
1 Hallelujah! [[H1984]] Sing [[H7891]] to the LORD [[H3068]] a new [[H2319]] song— [[H7892]] His praise [[H8416]] in the assembly [[H6951]] of the godly. [[H2623]] 
2 Let Israel [[H3478]] rejoice [[H8055]] in their Maker; [[H6213]] let the children [[H1121]] of Zion [[H6726]] rejoice [[H1523]] in their King. [[H4428]] 
3 Let them praise [[H1984]] His name [[H8034]] with dancing, [[H4234]] and make music [[H2167]] to Him  with tambourine [[H8596]] and harp. [[H3658]] 
4 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] takes pleasure [[H7521]] in His people; [[H5971]] He adorns [[H6286]] the afflicted [[H6035]] with salvation. [[H3444]] 
5 Let the saints [[H2623]] exult [[H5937]] in glory; [[H3519]] let them shout for joy [[H7442]] upon [[H5921]] their beds. [[H4904]] 
6 May the high praises [[H7319]] of God [[H410]] be in their mouths, [[H1627]] and a two-edged [[H6374]] sword [[H2719]] in their hands, [[H3027]] 
7 to inflict [[H6213]] vengeance [[H5360]] on the nations [[H1471]] and punishment [[H8433]] on [[H1077]] the peoples, [[H3816]] 
8 to bind [[H631]] their kings [[H4428]] with chains, [[H2131]] and their nobles [[H3513]] with shackles [[H3525]] of iron, [[H1270]] 
9 to execute [[H6213]] the judgment [[H4941]] written [against them]. [[H3789]] This [[H1931]] honor [[H1926]] is for all [[H3605]] His saints. [[H2623]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
