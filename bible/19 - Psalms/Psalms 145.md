1 [A Psalm] of praise. [[H8416]] Of David. [[H1732]] I will exalt You, [[H7311]] my God [[H433]] [and] King; [[H4428]] I will bless [[H1288]] Your name [[H8034]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]] 
2 Every [[H3605]] day [[H3117]] I will bless You, [[H1288]] and I will praise [[H1984]] Your name [[H8034]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]] 
3 Great [[H1419]] [is] the LORD [[H3068]] and greatly [[H3966]] to be praised; [[H1984]] His greatness [[H1420]] [is] unsearchable. [[H2714]] 
4 One generation [[H1755]] will commend [[H7623]] Your works [[H4639]] to the next, [[H1755]] and they shall proclaim [[H5046]] Your mighty acts, [[H1369]] 
5 the glorious [[H3519]] splendor [[H1926]] of Your majesty. [[H1935]] And I will meditate [[H7878]] on Your wondrous [[H6381]] works. [[H1697]] 
6 They will proclaim [[H559]] the power [[H5807]] of Your awesome deeds, [[H3372]] and I will declare [[H5608]] Your greatness. [[H1420]] 
7 They will extol [[H5042]] the fame [[H2143]] of Your abundant [[H7227]] goodness [[H2898]] and joyfully sing of [[H7442]] Your righteousness. [[H6666]] 
8 The LORD [[H3068]] is gracious [[H2587]] and compassionate, [[H7349]] slow [[H750]] to anger [[H639]] and abounding [[H1419]] in loving devotion. [[H2617]] 
9 The LORD [[H3068]] is good [[H2896]] to all; [[H3605]] His compassion [[H7356]] rests on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] He has made. [[H4639]] 
10 All [[H3605]] You have made [[H4639]] will give You thanks, [[H3034]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and Your saints [[H2623]] shall bless You. [[H1288]] 
11 They will tell [[H559]] of the glory [[H3519]] of Your kingdom [[H4438]] and speak of [[H1696]] Your might, [[H1369]] 
12 to make known [[H3045]] to men [[H120]] Your mighty acts [[H1369]] and the glorious [[H3519]] splendor [[H1926]] of Your kingdom. [[H4438]] 
13 Your kingdom [[H4438]] is an everlasting [[H5769]] kingdom, [[H4438]] and Your dominion [[H4475]] [endures] through [[H3605]] all [[H3605]] generations. [[H1755]] The LORD is faithful in all His words and kind in all His actions.וָדֽוֹר׃ (wā·ḏō·wr)Conjunctive waw | Noun - masculine singularStrong's 1755: A revolution of time, an age, generation, a dwelling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            OpenBible.com [[H1755]] 
14 The LORD [[H3068]] upholds [[H5564]] all [[H3605]] who fall [[H5307]] and lifts up [[H2210]] all [[H3605]] who are bowed down. [[H3721]] 
15 The eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] look [[H7663]] to You, [[H413]] and You [[H859]] give [[H5414]] them [[H853]] their food [[H400]] in season. [[H6256]] 
16 You open [[H6605]] Your hand [[H3027]] and satisfy [[H7646]] the desire [[H7522]] of every [[H3605]] living thing. [[H2416]]

19 He fulfills [[H6213]] the desires [[H7522]] of those who fear Him; [[H3373]] He hears [[H8085]] their cry [[H7775]] and saves them. [[H3467]] 
20 The LORD [[H3068]] preserves [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] who love Him, [[H157]] but [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7563]] He will destroy. [[H8045]] 
21 My mouth [[H6310]] will declare [[H1696]] the praise [[H8416]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] let every [[H3605]] creature [[H1320]] bless [[H1288]] His holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]
