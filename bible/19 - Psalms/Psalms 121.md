# Psalms 121
[[Psalms 120|←]] • [[Psalms 122|→]]
1 A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] I lift up [[H5375]] my eyes [[H5869]] to [[H413]] the hills. [[H2022]] From where [[H370]] does my help [[H5828]] come? [[H935]] 
2 My help [[H5828]] comes from [[H5973]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the Maker [[H6213]] of heaven [[H8064]] and earth. [[H776]] 
3 He will not [[H408]] allow [[H5414]] your foot [[H7272]] to slip; [[H4132]] your Protector [[H8104]] will not [[H408]] slumber. [[H5123]] 
4 Behold, [[H2009]] the Protector [[H8104]] of Israel [[H3478]] will not [[H3808]] slumber [[H5123]] or sleep. [[H3462]] 
5 The LORD [[H3068]] [is] your keeper; [[H8104]] the LORD [[H3068]] [is] the shade [[H6738]] on [[H5921]] your right [[H3225]] hand. [[H3027]] 
6 The sun [[H8121]] will not [[H3808]] strike [[H5221]] you by day [[H3119]] nor the moon [[H3394]] by night. [[H3915]] 
7 The LORD [[H3068]] will guard you [[H8104]] from all [[H3605]] evil; [[H7451]] He will preserve [[H8104]] your soul. [[H5315]] 
8 The LORD [[H3068]] will watch over [[H8104]] your coming [[H935]] and going, [[H3318]] both now [[H6258]] and forevermore. [[H5704]]
