# Psalms 72
[[Psalms 71|←]] • [[Psalms 73|→]]
1 Of Solomon. [[H8010]] Endow [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] with Your justice, [[H4941]] O God, [[H430]] and the son [[H1121]] of the king [[H4428]] with Your righteousness. [[H6666]] 
2 He will judge [[H1777]] Your people [[H5971]] with righteousness [[H6664]] and Your afflicted [[H6041]] with justice. [[H4941]] 
3 May the mountains [[H2022]] bring [[H5375]] peace [[H7965]] to the people [[H5971]] and the hills [[H1389]] [bring] righteousness. [[H6666]] 
4 May he vindicate [[H8199]] the afflicted [[H6041]] among the people; [[H5971]] may he save [[H3467]] the children [[H1121]] of the needy, [[H34]] and crush [[H1792]] the oppressor. [[H6231]] 
5 May they fear him [[H3372]] as long as [[H5973]] the sun [shines], [[H8121]] as long as [[H6440]] the moon [remains], [[H3394]] through all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]] 
6 May he be like rain [[H4306]] that falls [[H3381]] on [[H5921]] freshly cut grass, [[H1488]] like spring showers [[H7241]] that water [[H2222]] the earth. [[H776]] 
7 May the righteous [[H6662]] flourish [[H6524]] in his days [[H3117]] and prosperity [[H7965]] abound, [[H7230]] until [[H5704]] the moon [[H3394]] is no more. [[H1097]] 
8 May he rule [[H7287]] from sea [[H3220]] to [[H5704]] sea, [[H3220]] and from the [Euphrates] [[H5104]] to [[H5704]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth. [[H776]] 
9 May the nomads [[H6728]] bow [[H3766]] before him, [[H6440]] and his enemies [[H341]] lick [[H3897]] the dust. [[H6083]] 
10 May the kings [[H4428]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] and distant shores [[H339]] bring [[H7725]] tribute; [[H4503]] may the kings [[H4428]] of Sheba [[H7614]] and Seba [[H5434]] offer [[H7126]] gifts. [[H814]] 
11 May all [[H3605]] kings [[H4428]] bow down to him [[H7812]] [and] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] serve him. [[H5647]] 
12 For [[H3588]] he shall deliver [[H5337]] the needy [[H34]] who cry out [[H7768]] and the afflicted [[H6041]] who have no [[H369]] helper. [[H5826]] 
13 He will have compassion [[H2347]] on [[H5921]] the poor [[H1800]] and needy [[H34]] and save [[H3467]] the lives [[H5315]] of the oppressed. [[H34]] 
14 He will rescue [[H1350]] them [[H5315]] from oppression [[H8496]] and violence, [[H2555]] for their blood [[H1818]] is precious [[H3365]] in his sight. [[H5869]] 
15 Long may he live! [[H2421]] May gold [[H2091]] from Sheba [[H7614]] be given [[H5414]] him.  May people ever [[H8548]] pray [[H6419]] for him; [[H1157]] may they bless him [[H1288]] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]] 
16 May there be [[H1961]] an abundance [[H6451]] of grain [[H1250]] in the land; [[H776]] may it sway [[H7493]] atop [[H7218]] the hills. [[H2022]] May its fruit trees [[H6529]] flourish [[H6692]] like [the forests of] Lebanon, [[H3844]] and its people [[H5892]] like the grass [[H6212]] of the field. [[H776]] 
17 May his name [[H8034]] endure [[H1961]] forever; [[H5769]] may his name [[H8034]] increase [[H5125]] as [[H6440]] long as the sun shines. [[H8121]] In him  may all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] be blessed; [[H1288]] may they call him blessed. [[H833]] 
18 Blessed be [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who alone [[H905]] does [[H6213]] marvelous deeds. [[H6381]] 
19 And blessed [[H1288]] [be] His glorious [[H3519]] name [[H8034]] forever; [[H5769]] may all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] be filled [[H4390]] with His glory. [[H3519]] Amen [[H543]] and amen. [[H543]] 
20 This concludes [[H3615]] the prayers [[H8605]] of David [[H1732]] son [[H1121]] of Jesse. [[H3448]]
