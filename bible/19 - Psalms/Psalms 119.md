# Psalms 119
[[Psalms 118|←]] • [[Psalms 120|→]]
1 Blessed [[H835]] [are] those whose way [[H1870]] is blameless, [[H8549]] who walk [[H1980]] in the law [[H8451]] of the LORD. [[H3069]] 
2 Blessed [[H835]] are those who keep [[H5341]] His testimonies, [[H5713]] and seek [[H1875]] Him with all [[H3605]] their heart. [[H3820]] 
3 They [[H637]] do [[H6466]] no [[H3808]] iniquity; [[H5766]] they walk [[H1980]] in His ways. [[H1870]] 
4 You [[H859]] have ordained [[H6680]] Your precepts, [[H6490]] that we should keep them [[H8104]] diligently. [[H3966]] 
5 Oh, that [[H305]] my ways [[H1870]] were committed [[H3559]] to keeping [[H8104]] Your statutes! [[H2706]] 
6 Then [[H227]] I would not [[H3808]] be ashamed [[H954]] when I consider [[H5027]] all [[H3605]] Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
7 I will praise You [[H3034]] with an upright [[H3476]] heart [[H3824]] when I learn [[H3925]] Your righteous [[H6664]] judgments. [[H4941]] 
8 I will keep [[H8104]] Your statutes; [[H2706]] do not [[H408]] utterly [[H5704]] forsake me. [[H5800]] 
9 How [[H4100]] can a young man [[H5288]] keep his way [[H734]] pure? [[H2135]] By guarding it [[H8104]] according to Your word. [[H1697]] 
10 With all [[H3605]] my heart [[H3820]] I have sought You; [[H1875]] do not [[H408]] let me stray [[H7686]] from Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
11 I have hidden [[H6845]] Your word [[H565]] in my heart [[H3820]] that [[H4616]] I might not [[H3808]] sin against You. [[H2398]] 
12 Blessed are [[H1288]] You, [[H859]] O LORD; [[H3069]] teach [[H3925]] me Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
13 With my lips [[H8193]] I proclaim [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] the judgments [[H4941]] of Your mouth. [[H6310]] 
14 I rejoice [[H7797]] in the way [[H1870]] of Your testimonies [[H5715]] as much as in [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] riches. [[H1952]] 
15 I will meditate [[H7878]] on Your precepts [[H6490]] and regard [[H5027]] Your ways. [[H734]] 
16 I will delight [[H8173]] in Your statutes; [[H2708]] I will not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] Your word. [[H1697]] 
17 Deal bountifully [[H1580]] with [[H5921]] Your servant, [[H5650]] that I may live [[H2421]] and keep [[H8104]] Your word. [[H1697]] 
18 Open [[H1540]] my eyes [[H5869]] that I may see [[H5027]] wondrous things [[H6381]] from Your law. [[H8451]] 
19 I [[H595]] am a stranger [[H1616]] on the earth; [[H776]] do not [[H408]] hide [[H5641]] Your commandments [[H4687]] from me. [[H4480]] 
20 My soul [[H5315]] is consumed [[H1638]] with longing [[H8375]] for [[H413]] Your judgments [[H4941]] at all [[H3605]] times. [[H6256]] 
21 You rebuke [[H1605]] the arrogant— [[H2086]] the cursed [[H779]] who stray [[H7686]] from Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
22 Remove [[H1556]] my [[H5921]] scorn [[H2781]] and contempt, [[H937]] for [[H3588]] I have kept [[H5341]] Your testimonies. [[H5713]] 
23 Though [[H1571]] rulers [[H8269]] sit [[H3427]] and slander me, [[H1696]] Your servant [[H5650]] meditates [[H7878]] on Your statutes; [[H2706]] 
24 Your testimonies [[H5713]] are indeed [[H1571]] my delight; [[H8191]] [they are] my [[H6098]] counselors. [[H582]] 
25 My soul [[H5315]] cleaves [[H1692]] to the dust; [[H6083]] revive me [[H2421]] according to Your word. [[H1697]] 
26 I recounted [[H5608]] my ways [[H1870]] and You answered me; [[H6030]] teach [[H3925]] me Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
27 Make clear to me [[H995]] the way [[H1870]] of Your precepts; [[H6490]] then I will meditate [[H7878]] on Your wonders. [[H6381]] 
28 My soul [[H5315]] melts [[H1811]] with sorrow; [[H8424]] strengthen me [[H6965]] according to Your word. [[H1697]] 
29 Remove [[H5493]] me from [[H4480]] the path [[H1870]] of deceit [[H8267]] and graciously grant me [[H2603]] Your law. [[H8451]] 
30 I have chosen [[H977]] the way [[H1870]] of truth; [[H530]] I have set [[H7737]] Your ordinances {before me}. [[H4941]] 
31 I cling [[H1692]] to Your testimonies, [[H5715]] O LORD; [[H3069]] let me not [[H408]] be put to shame. [[H954]] 
32 I run [[H7323]] in the path [[H1870]] of Your commandments, [[H4687]] for [[H3588]] You will enlarge [[H7337]] my heart. [[H3820]] 
33 Teach me, [[H3384]] O LORD, [[H3069]] the way [[H1870]] of Your statutes, [[H2706]] and I will keep [them] [[H5341]] to the end. [[H6118]] 
34 Give me understanding [[H995]] that I may observe [[H5341]] Your law, [[H8451]] and follow it [[H8104]] with all [[H3605]] my heart. [[H3820]] 
35 Direct me [[H1869]] in the path [[H5410]] of Your commandments, [[H4687]] for [[H3588]] there  I find delight. [[H2654]] 
36 Turn [[H5186]] my heart [[H3820]] to [[H413]] Your testimonies [[H5715]] and not [[H408]] to [[H413]] covetous gain. [[H1215]] 
37 Turn [[H5674]] my eyes [[H5869]] [away] [[H7200]] from worthless things; [[H7723]] revive me [[H2421]] with Your word. [[H1870]] 
38 Establish [[H6965]] Your word [[H565]] to Your servant, [[H5650]] to produce [[H834]] reverence for You. [[H3374]] 
39 Turn away [[H5674]] the disgrace [[H2781]] I dread, [[H3025]] for [[H3588]] Your judgments [[H4941]] are good. [[H2896]] 
40 How [[H2009]] I long [[H8373]] for Your precepts! [[H6490]] Revive me [[H2421]] in Your righteousness. [[H6666]] 
41 May Your loving devotion [[H2617]] come to me, [[H935]] O LORD, [[H3069]] Your salvation, [[H8668]] according to Your promise. [[H565]] 
42 Then I can answer [[H6030]] him who taunts, [[H2778]] for [[H3588]] I trust [[H982]] in Your word. [[H1697]] 
43 Never [[H408]] snatch [[H5337]] the word [[H1697]] of truth [[H571]] from my mouth, [[H6310]] for [[H3588]] I hope [[H3176]] in Your judgments. [[H4941]] 
44 I will always [[H8548]] obey [[H8104]] Your law, [[H8451]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]] 
45 And I will walk [[H1980]] in freedom, [[H7342]] for [[H3588]] I have sought [[H1875]] Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
46 I will speak [[H1696]] of Your testimonies [[H5713]] before [[H5048]] kings, [[H4428]] and I will not [[H3808]] be ashamed. [[H954]] 
47 I delight [[H8173]] in Your commandments [[H4687]] because [[H834]] I love them. [[H157]] 
48 I lift up [[H5375]] my hands [[H3709]] to [[H413]] Your commandments, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I love, [[H157]] and I meditate [[H7878]] on Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
49 Remember [[H2142]] Your word [[H1697]] to Your servant, [[H5650]] upon [[H5921]] which [[H834]] You have given me hope. [[H3176]] 
50 This [[H2063]] is my comfort [[H5165]] in affliction, [[H6040]] that [[H3588]] Your promise [[H565]] has given me life. [[H2421]] 
51 The arrogant [[H2086]] utterly [[H5704]] deride me, [[H3887]] but I do not [[H3808]] turn [[H5186]] from Your law. [[H8451]] 
52 I remember [[H2142]] Your judgments [[H4941]] of old, [[H5769]] O LORD, [[H3069]] and in them I find comfort. [[H5162]] 
53 Rage [[H2152]] has taken hold of me [[H270]] because of the wicked [[H7563]] who reject [[H5800]] Your law. [[H8451]] 
54 Your statutes [[H2706]] are [[H1961]] songs [[H2158]] to me  in the house [[H1004]] of my pilgrimage. [[H4033]] 
55 In the night, [[H3915]] O LORD, [[H3069]] I remember [[H2142]] Your name, [[H8034]] and I will keep [[H8104]] Your law. [[H8451]] 
56 This [[H2063]] is my practice, [[H1961]] for [[H3588]] I obey [[H5341]] Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
57 The LORD [[H3069]] is my portion; [[H2506]] I have promised [[H559]] to keep [[H8104]] Your words. [[H1697]] 
58 I have sought [[H2470]] Your face [[H6440]] with all [[H3605]] my heart; [[H3820]] be gracious to me [[H2603]] according to Your promise. [[H565]] 
59 I considered [[H2803]] my ways [[H1870]] and turned [[H7725]] my steps [[H7272]] to [[H413]] Your testimonies. [[H5713]] 
60 I hurried [[H2363]] without [[H3808]] hesitating [[H4102]] to keep [[H8104]] Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
61 Though the ropes [[H2256]] of the wicked [[H7563]] bind me, [[H5749]] I do not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] Your law. [[H8451]] 
62 At midnight [[H2676]] I rise [[H6965]] to give You thanks [[H3034]] for [[H5921]] Your righteous [[H6664]] judgments. [[H4941]] 
63 I [[H589]] am a friend [[H2270]] to all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] fear You, [[H3372]] and to those who keep [[H8104]] Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
64 The earth [[H776]] is filled [[H4390]] with Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] O LORD; [[H3069]] teach [[H3925]] me Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
65 You are [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] to [[H5973]] Your servant, [[H5650]] O LORD, [[H3069]] according to Your word. [[H1697]] 
66 Teach [[H3925]] me good [[H2898]] judgment [[H2940]] and knowledge, [[H1847]] for [[H3588]] I believe [[H539]] in Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
67 Before [[H2962]] I was afflicted, [[H6031]] I [[H589]] went astray; [[H7683]] but now [[H6258]] I keep [[H8104]] Your word. [[H565]] 
68 You [[H859]] are good, [[H2896]] and You do what is good; [[H2895]] teach [[H3925]] me Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
69 Though the arrogant [[H2086]] have smeared [[H2950]] me with lies, [[H8267]] I [[H589]] will keep [[H5341]] Your precepts [[H6490]] with all [[H3605]] my heart. [[H3820]] 
70 Their hearts [[H3820]] are hard [[H2954]] and callous, [[H2459]] but I [[H589]] delight [[H8173]] in Your law. [[H8451]] 
71 It was good [[H2896]] for me to [[H3588]] be afflicted, [[H6031]] that [[H4616]] I might learn [[H3925]] Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
72 The law [[H8451]] from Your mouth [[H6310]] is more precious [[H2896]] to me  than thousands [of pieces] [[H505]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver. [[H3701]] 
73 Your hands [[H3027]] have made me [[H6213]] and fashioned me; [[H3559]] give me understanding [[H995]] to learn [[H3925]] Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
74 May those who fear You [[H3373]] see me [[H7200]] and rejoice, [[H8055]] for [[H3588]] I have hoped [[H3176]] in Your word. [[H1697]] 
75 I know, [[H3045]] O LORD, [[H3069]] that [[H3588]] Your judgments [[H4941]] are righteous, [[H6664]] and that in faithfulness [[H530]] You have afflicted me. [[H6031]] 
76 May [[H1961]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] comfort me, [[H5162]] I pray, [[H4994]] according to Your promise [[H565]] to Your servant. [[H5650]] 
77 May Your compassion [[H7356]] come to me, [[H935]] that I may live, [[H2421]] for [[H3588]] Your law [[H8451]] [is] my delight. [[H8191]] 
78 May the arrogant [[H2086]] be put to shame [[H954]] for [[H3588]] subverting me [[H5791]] with a lie; [[H8267]] I [[H589]] will meditate [[H7878]] on Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
79 May those who fear You [[H3373]] turn [[H7725]] to me,  those who know [[H3045]] Your testimonies. [[H5713]] 
80 May my heart [[H3820]] be [[H1961]] blameless [[H8549]] in Your statutes, [[H2706]] that [[H4616]] I may not [[H3808]] be put to shame. [[H954]] 
81 My soul [[H5315]] faints [[H3615]] for Your salvation; [[H8668]] I wait [[H3176]] for Your word. [[H1697]] 
82 My eyes [[H5869]] fail, [[H3615]] looking for Your promise; [[H565]] I ask, [[H559]] “When [[H4970]] will You comfort me?” [[H5162]] 
83 Though [[H3588]] I am [[H1961]] like a wineskin [[H4997]] dried by smoke, [[H7008]] I do not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
84 How many [[H4100]] days [[H3117]] must Your servant wait? [[H5650]] When [[H4970]] will You execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] on my persecutors? [[H7291]] 
85 The arrogant [[H2086]] have dug [[H3738]] pits [[H7882]] for me  in violation of [[H3808]] Your law. [[H8451]] 
86 All [[H3605]] Your commandments [[H4687]] [are] faithful; [[H530]] I am persecuted [[H7291]] without cause— [[H8267]] help me! [[H5826]] 
87 They almost [[H4592]] wiped me [[H3615]] from the earth, [[H776]] but I [[H589]] have not [[H3808]] forsaken [[H5800]] Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
88 Revive me [[H2421]] according to Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] and I will obey [[H8104]] the testimony [[H5715]] of Your mouth. [[H6310]] 
89 Your word, [[H1697]] O LORD, [[H3069]] [is] everlasting; [[H5769]] it is firmly fixed [[H5324]] in the heavens. [[H8064]] 
90 Your faithfulness [[H530]] [continues] through all [[H1755]] generations; [[H1755]] You established [[H3559]] the earth, [[H776]] and it endures. [[H5975]] 
91 They stand [[H5975]] this day [[H3117]] according to Your ordinances, [[H4941]] for [[H3588]] all things [[H3605]] are servants to You. [[H5650]] 
92 If Your law [[H8451]] had not [[H3884]] been my delight, [[H8191]] then [[H227]] I would have perished [[H6]] in my affliction. [[H6040]] 
93 I will never [[H5769]] forget [[H7911]] Your precepts, [[H6490]] for [[H3588]] by them  You have revived me. [[H2421]] 
94 I am [[H589]] Yours;  save me, [[H3467]] for [[H3588]] I have sought [[H1875]] Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
95 The wicked [[H7563]] wait [[H6960]] to destroy [[H6]] me,  but I will ponder [[H995]] Your testimonies. [[H5713]] 
96 I have seen [[H7200]] an end [[H7093]] to all [[H3605]] perfection, [[H8502]] but Your commandment [[H4687]] is without limit. [[H3966]] 
97 Oh, how [[H4100]] I love [[H157]] Your law! [[H8451]] All [[H3605]] day long [[H3117]] it [[H1931]] is my meditation. [[H7881]] 
98 Your commandments [[H4687]] make me wiser [[H2449]] than my enemies, [[H341]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] are always [[H5769]] with me.  
99 I have more insight [[H7919]] than all [[H3605]] my teachers, [[H3925]] for [[H3588]] Your testimonies [[H5715]] are my meditation. [[H7881]] 
100 I discern [[H995]] more than the elders, [[H2205]] because [[H3588]] I obey [[H5341]] Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
101 I have kept [[H3607]] my feet [[H7272]] from every [[H3605]] evil [[H7451]] path, [[H734]] that [[H4616]] I may keep [[H8104]] Your word. [[H1697]] 
102 I have not [[H3808]] departed [[H5493]] from Your ordinances, [[H4941]] for [[H3588]] You Yourself [[H859]] have taught me. [[H3384]] 
103 How [[H4100]] sweet [[H4452]] are Your words [[H565]] to my taste, [[H2441]] [sweeter than] honey [[H1706]] in my mouth. [[H6310]] 
104 I gain understanding [[H995]] from Your precepts; [[H6490]] therefore [[H5921]] I hate [[H8130]] every [[H3605]] FALSE [[H8267]] way. [[H734]] 
105 Your word [[H1697]] is a lamp [[H5216]] to my feet [[H7272]] and a light [[H216]] to my path. [[H5410]] 
106 I have sworn [[H7650]] and confirmed [[H6965]] that I will keep [[H8104]] Your righteous [[H6664]] judgments. [[H4941]] 
107 I am severely [[H5704]] afflicted, [[H6031]] O LORD; [[H3069]] revive me [[H2421]] through Your word. [[H1697]] 
108 Accept [[H7521]] the freewill offerings [[H5071]] of my mouth, [[H6310]] O [[H4994]] LORD, [[H3069]] and teach [[H3925]] me Your judgments. [[H4941]] 
109 I constantly [take] [[H8548]] my life [[H5315]] in my hands, [[H3709]] yet I do not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] Your law. [[H8451]] 
110 The wicked [[H7563]] have set [[H5414]] a snare [[H6341]] for me,  but I have not [[H3808]] wandered [[H8582]] from Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
111 Your testimonies [[H5715]] are my heritage forever, [[H5157]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are the joy [[H8342]] of my heart. [[H3820]] 
112 I have inclined [[H5186]] my heart [[H3820]] to perform [[H6213]] Your statutes, [[H2706]] even [[H5769]] to the very end. [[H6118]] 
113 The double-minded [[H5588]] I despise, [[H8130]] but Your law [[H8451]] I love. [[H157]] 
114 You [[H859]] [are] my hiding place [[H5643]] and my shield; [[H4043]] I put my hope [[H3176]] in Your word. [[H1697]] 
115 Depart [[H5493]] from me, [[H4480]] you evildoers, [[H7489]] that I may obey [[H5341]] the commandments [[H4687]] of my God. [[H430]] 
116 Sustain me [[H5564]] as You promised, [[H565]] that I may live; [[H2421]] let me not [[H408]] be ashamed [[H954]] of my hope. [[H7664]] 
117 Uphold me, [[H5582]] and I will be delivered, [[H3467]] that I may always [[H8548]] regard [[H8159]] Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
118 You reject [[H5541]] all [[H3605]] who stray [[H7686]] from Your statutes, [[H2706]] for [[H3588]] their deceitfulness [[H8649]] is in vain. [[H8267]] 
119 All [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7563]] on earth [[H776]] You discard [[H7673]] like dross; [[H5509]] therefore [[H3651]] I love [[H157]] Your testimonies. [[H5713]] 
120 My flesh [[H1320]] trembles [[H5568]] in awe of You; [[H6343]] I stand in fear [[H3372]] of Your judgments. [[H4941]] 
121 I have done [[H6213]] what is just [[H4941]] and right; [[H6664]] do not [[H1077]] leave me [[H3240]] to my oppressors. [[H6231]] 
122 Ensure [[H6148]] Your servant’s [[H5650]] well-being; [[H2896]] do not [[H408]] let the arrogant [[H2086]] oppress me. [[H6231]] 
123 My eyes [[H5869]] fail, [[H3615]] looking for Your salvation, [[H3444]] [and] for Your righteous [[H6664]] promise. [[H565]] 
124 Deal [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] Your servant [[H5650]] according to Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] and teach me [[H3925]] Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
125 I [[H589]] am Your servant; [[H5650]] give me understanding [[H995]] that I may know [[H3045]] Your testimonies. [[H5713]] 
126 It is time [[H6256]] for the LORD [[H3069]] to act, [[H6213]] [for] they have broken [[H6565]] Your law. [[H8451]] 
127 Therefore [[H5921]] I love [[H157]] Your commandments [[H4687]] more than gold, [[H2091]] even the purest gold. [[H6337]] 
128 Therefore [[H5921]] I admire [[H3474]] all [[H3605]] Your precepts [[H6490]] and hate [[H8130]] every [[H3605]] FALSE [[H8267]] way. [[H734]] 
129 Wonderful are [[H6382]] Your testimonies; [[H5715]] therefore [[H5921]] I [[H5315]] obey them. [[H5341]] 
130 The unfolding [[H6608]] of Your words [[H1697]] gives light; [[H215]] it informs [[H995]] the simple. [[H6612]] 
131 I open [[H6473]] my mouth [[H6310]] and pant, [[H7602]] as [[H3588]] I long [[H2968]] for Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
132 Turn [[H6437]] to me [[H413]] and show me mercy, [[H2603]] as You do [[H4941]] to those who love [[H157]] Your name. [[H8034]] 
133 Establish [[H3559]] my steps [[H6471]] through Your promise; [[H565]] let no [[H408]] sin [[H205]] rule [[H7980]] over me.  
134 Redeem me [[H6299]] from the oppression [[H6233]] of man, [[H120]] that I may keep [[H8104]] Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
135 Make Your face [[H6440]] shine [[H215]] upon Your servant, [[H5650]] and teach [[H3925]] me [[H853]] Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
136 My eyes [[H5869]] shed [[H3381]] streams [[H6388]] of tears [[H4325]] because [[H5921]] Your law [[H8451]] is not [[H3808]] obeyed. [[H8104]] 
137 Righteous [[H6662]] are You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3069]] and upright [[H3477]] are Your judgments. [[H4941]] 
138 The testimonies [[H5713]] You have laid down [[H6680]] are righteous [[H6664]] and altogether [[H3966]] faithful. [[H530]] 
139 My zeal [[H7068]] has consumed me [[H6789]] because [[H3588]] my foes [[H6862]] forget [[H7911]] Your words. [[H1697]] 
140 Your promise [[H565]] is completely [[H3966]] pure; [[H6884]] therefore Your servant [[H5650]] loves it. [[H157]] 
141 I [[H595]] am lowly [[H6810]] and despised, [[H959]] but I do not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
142 Your righteousness [[H6666]] is an everlasting [[H5769]] righteousness, [[H6664]] and Your law [[H8451]] is true. [[H571]] 
143 Trouble [[H6862]] and distress [[H4689]] have found me, [[H4672]] but Your commandments [[H4687]] are my delight. [[H8191]] 
144 Your testimonies [[H5715]] are righteous [[H6664]] forever. [[H5769]] Give me understanding, [[H995]] that I may live. [[H2421]] 
145 I call [[H7121]] with all [[H3605]] my heart; [[H3820]] answer me, [[H6030]] O LORD! [[H3069]] I will obey [[H5341]] Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
146 I call to You; [[H7121]] save me, [[H3467]] that I may keep [[H8104]] Your testimonies. [[H5713]] 
147 I rise [[H6923]] before dawn [[H5399]] and cry for help; [[H7768]] in  Your word [[H1697]] I have put my hope. [[H3176]] 
148 My eyes [[H5869]] anticipate [[H6923]] the watches of night, [[H821]] that I may meditate [[H7878]] on Your word. [[H565]] 
149 Hear [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] O LORD, [[H3069]] according to Your loving devotion; [[H2617]] give me life [[H2421]] according to Your justice. [[H4941]] 
150 Those who follow [[H7291]] after wickedness [[H2154]] draw near; [[H7126]] they are far [[H7368]] from Your law. [[H8451]] 
151 You [[H859]] are near, [[H7138]] O LORD, [[H3069]] and all [[H3605]] Your commandments [[H4687]] are true. [[H571]] 
152 Long ago [[H6924]] I learned [[H3045]] from Your testimonies [[H5713]] that [[H3588]] You have established them [[H3245]] forever. [[H5769]] 
153 Look [[H7200]] upon my affliction [[H6040]] and rescue me, [[H2502]] for [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] forgotten [[H7911]] Your law. [[H8451]] 
154 Defend [[H7378]] my cause [[H7379]] and redeem me; [[H1350]] revive me [[H2421]] according to Your word. [[H565]] 
155 Salvation [[H3444]] is far [[H7350]] from the wicked [[H7563]] because [[H3588]] they do not [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
156 Great [[H7227]] are Your mercies, [[H7356]] O LORD; [[H3069]] revive me [[H2421]] according to Your ordinances. [[H4941]] 
157 [Though] my persecutors [[H7291]] and foes [[H6862]] are many, [[H7227]] I have not [[H3808]] turned [[H5186]] from Your testimonies. [[H5715]] 
158 I look on [[H7200]] the faithless [[H898]] with loathing [[H6962]] because [[H834]] they do not [[H3808]] keep [[H8104]] Your word. [[H565]] 
159 Consider [[H7200]] how [[H3588]] I love [[H157]] Your precepts, [[H6490]] O LORD; [[H3069]] give me life [[H2421]] according to Your loving devotion. [[H2617]] 
160 Your word [[H1697]] is the essence [[H7218]] of truth, [[H571]] and all [[H3605]] Your righteous [[H6664]] judgments [[H4941]] endure. [[H5769]] 
161 Rulers [[H8269]] persecute me [[H7291]] without cause, [[H2600]] but my heart [[H3820]] fears only [[H6342]] Your word. [[H1697]] 
162 I [[H595]] rejoice [[H7797]] in [[H5921]] Your promise [[H565]] like one who finds [[H4672]] great [[H7227]] spoil. [[H7998]] 
163 I hate [[H8130]] and abhor [[H8581]] falsehood, [[H8267]] [but] Your law [[H8451]] I love. [[H157]] 
164 Seven times [[H7651]] a day [[H3117]] I praise You [[H1984]] for [[H5921]] Your righteous [[H6664]] judgments. [[H4941]] 
165 Abundant [[H7227]] peace belongs [[H7965]] to those who love [[H157]] Your instruction; [[H8451]] nothing [[H369]] can make them stumble. [[H4383]] 
166 I wait [[H7663]] for Your salvation, [[H3444]] O LORD, [[H3069]] and I carry out [[H6213]] Your commandments. [[H4687]] 
167 I [[H5315]] obey [[H8104]] Your testimonies [[H5713]] and love [[H157]] them greatly. [[H3966]] 
168 I obey [[H8104]] Your precepts [[H6490]] and Your testimonies, [[H5713]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] my ways [[H1870]] are before You. [[H5048]] 
169 May my cry [[H7440]] come [[H7126]] before You, [[H6440]] O LORD; [[H3069]] give me understanding [[H995]] according to Your word. [[H1697]] 
170 May my plea [[H8467]] come [[H935]] before You; [[H6440]] rescue [[H5337]] me according to Your promise. [[H565]] 
171 My lips [[H8193]] pour forth [[H5042]] praise, [[H8416]] for [[H3588]] You teach me [[H3925]] Your statutes. [[H2706]] 
172 My tongue [[H3956]] sings [[H6030]] of Your word, [[H565]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] Your commandments [[H4687]] are righteous. [[H6664]] 
173 May Your hand [[H3027]] be ready [[H1961]] to help me, [[H5826]] for [[H3588]] I have chosen [[H977]] Your precepts. [[H6490]] 
174 I long [[H8373]] for Your salvation, [[H3444]] O LORD, [[H3069]] and Your law [[H8451]] is my delight. [[H8191]] 
175 Let me [[H5315]] live [[H2421]] to praise You; [[H1984]] may Your judgments [[H4941]] sustain me. [[H5826]] 
176 I have strayed [[H8582]] like a lost [[H6]] sheep; [[H7716]] seek [[H1245]] Your servant, [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] forgotten [[H7911]] Your commandments. [[H4687]]
