# Psalms 127
[[Psalms 126|←]] • [[Psalms 128|→]]
1 A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] Of Solomon. [[H8010]] Unless [[H518]] the LORD [[H3068]] builds [[H1129]] the house, [[H1004]] its builders [[H1129]] labor [[H5998]] in  vain; [[H7723]] unless [[H518]] the LORD [[H3068]] protects [[H8104]] the city, [[H5892]] its watchmen [[H8104]] stand guard [[H8245]] in vain. [[H7723]] 
2 In vain [[H7723]] you  rise [[H6965]] early [[H7925]] and stay up [[H3427]] late, [[H309]] toiling [[H6089]] for bread [[H3899]] to eat— [[H398]] for [[H3651]] He gives [[H5414]] sleep [[H8142]] to His beloved. [[H3039]] 
3 Children [[H1121]] are indeed [[H2009]] a heritage [[H5159]] from the LORD, [[H3068]] [and] the fruit [[H6529]] of the womb [[H990]] [is His] reward. [[H7939]] 
4 Like arrows [[H2671]] in the hand [[H3027]] of a warrior, [[H1368]] so [are] [[H3651]] children [[H1121]] [born in] one’s youth. [[H5271]] 
5 Blessed [[H835]] is the man [[H1397]] whose [[H834]] quiver [[H827]] is full [[H4390]] of them. [[H1992]] He will not [[H3808]] be put to shame [[H954]] when [[H3588]] he confronts [[H1696]] the enemies [[H341]] at the gate. [[H8179]]
