1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] Rescue me, [[H2502]] O LORD, [[H3068]] from evil [[H7451]] men. [[H120]] Protect me [[H5341]] from men [[H376]] of violence, [[H2555]] 
2 who [[H834]] devise [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] in their hearts [[H3820]] and stir up [[H1481]] war [[H4421]] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]] 
3 They make their tongues [[H3956]] as sharp [[H8150]] as [[H3644]] serpents; [[H5175]] the venom [[H2534]] of vipers [[H5919]] is on [[H8478]] their lips. [[H8193]] Selah [[H5542]] 
4 Guard me, [[H8104]] O LORD, [[H3068]] from the hands [[H3027]] of the wicked. [[H7563]] Keep me safe [[H5341]] from men [[H376]] of violence [[H2555]] who [[H834]] scheme [[H2803]] to make me stumble. [[H1760]] 
5 The proud [[H1343]] hide [[H2934]] a snare [[H6341]] for me;  the cords [[H2256]] of their net [[H7568]] are spread [[H6566]] along [[H3027]] the path, [[H4570]] and lures [[H4170]] are set out [[H7896]] for me.  Selah [[H5542]] 
6 I say [[H559]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] “You [[H859]] are my God.” [[H410]] Hear, [[H238]] O LORD, [[H3068]] my cry for help. [[H8469]] 
7 O GOD [[H3069]] the Lord, [[H136]] the strength [[H5797]] of my salvation, [[H3444]] You shield [[H5526]] my head [[H7218]] in the day [[H3117]] of battle. [[H5402]] 
8 Grant [[H5414]] not, [[H408]] O LORD, [[H3068]] the desires [[H3970]] of the wicked; [[H7563]] do not [[H408]] promote [[H6329]] their evil plans, [[H2162]] [lest] they be exalted. [[H7311]] Selah [[H5542]] 
9 May the heads [[H7218]] of those who surround me [[H4524]] be covered [[H3680]] in the trouble [[H5999]] their lips have caused. [[H8193]] 
10 May burning coals [[H1513]] fall [[H4131]] on them; [[H5921]] may they be thrown [[H5307]] into the fire, [[H784]] into the miry pits, [[H4113]] never [[H1077]] to rise again. [[H6965]] 
11 May no slanderer [[H376]] be established [[H3559]] in the land. [[H776]] May calamity [[H7451]] hunt down [[H6679]] the man [[H376]] of violence. [[H2555]] 
12 I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] upholds [[H6213]] justice [[H1779]] for the poor [[H6041]] [and defends] the cause [[H4941]] of the needy. [[H34]] 
13 Surely [[H389]] the righteous [[H6662]] will praise [[H3034]] Your name; [[H8034]] the upright [[H3477]] will dwell [[H3427]] in Your presence. [[H6440]]
