# Psalms 87
[[Psalms 86|←]] • [[Psalms 88|→]]
1 A Psalm [[H4210]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] A Song. [[H7892]] His foundation [[H3248]] [is] on the holy [[H6944]] mountains. [[H2042]] 
2 The LORD [[H3068]] loves [[H157]] the gates [[H8179]] of Zion [[H6726]] more than all [[H3605]] the dwellings [[H4908]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] 
3 Glorious things [[H3513]] are ascribed [[H1696]] to you,  O city [[H5892]] of God. [[H430]] Selah [[H5542]] 
4 I will mention [[H2142]] Rahab [[H7294]] and Babylon [[H894]] among those who know Me— [[H3045]] along with [[H2009]] Philistia, [[H6429]] Tyre, [[H6865]] and [[H5973]] Cush— [[H3568]] [when I say,] “This one [[H2088]] was born [[H3205]] [in Zion].” [[H8033]] 
5 And it will be said [[H559]] of Zion: [[H6726]] “This one [[H376]] and that one [[H376]] were born [[H3205]] in her,  and the Most High [[H5945]] Himself [[H1931]] will establish her.” [[H3559]] 
6 The LORD [[H3068]] will record [[H5608]] in the register [[H3789]] of the peoples: [[H5971]] “This [[H2088]] one was born [[H3205]] [in Zion].” [[H8033]] Selah [[H5542]] 
7 Singers [[H7891]] and pipers will say: [[H2490]] “All [[H3605]] my springs [of joy] [[H4599]] [are] in You.”
