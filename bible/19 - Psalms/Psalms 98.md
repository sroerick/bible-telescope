[[Psalms 97|←]] • [[Psalms 99|→]]
1 A Psalm. [[H4210]] Sing [[H7891]] to the LORD [[H3068]] a new [[H2319]] song, [[H7892]] for [[H3588]] He has done [[H6213]] wonders; [[H6381]] His right hand [[H3225]] and holy [[H6944]] arm [[H2220]] have gained Him the victory. [[H3467]] 
2 The LORD [[H3068]] has proclaimed [[H3045]] His salvation [[H3444]] [and] revealed [[H1540]] His righteousness [[H6666]] to [[H5869]] the nations. [[H1471]] 
3 He has remembered [[H2142]] His love [[H2617]] and faithfulness [[H530]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth [[H776]] have seen [[H7200]] the salvation [[H3444]] of our God. [[H430]] 
4 Make a joyful noise [[H7321]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the earth; [[H776]] break forth— [[H6476]] let your cry ring out [[H7442]] and sing praises! [[H2167]] 
5 Sing praises [[H2167]] to the LORD [[H3068]] with the lyre, [[H3658]] in melodious [[H2172]] song [[H6963]] with the harp. [[H3658]] 
6 With trumpets [[H2689]] and the blast [[H6963]] of the horn [[H7782]] shout for joy [[H7321]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the King. [[H4428]] 
7 Let the sea [[H3220]] resound, [[H7481]] and all that fills it, [[H4393]] the world, [[H8398]] and all who live in it. [[H3427]] 
8 Let the rivers [[H5104]] clap [[H4222]] their hands, [[H3709]] let the mountains [[H2022]] sing together [[H3162]] for joy [[H7442]] 
9 before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He comes [[H935]] to judge [[H8199]] the earth. [[H776]] He will judge [[H8199]] the world [[H8398]] with righteousness, [[H6664]] and the peoples [[H5971]] with equity. [[H4339]]
