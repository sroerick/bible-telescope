# Psalms 133
[[Psalms 132|←]] • [[Psalms 134|→]]
1 A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] Of David. [[H1732]] Behold, [[H2009]] how [[H4100]] good [[H2896]] and how [[H4100]] pleasant it is [[H5273]] when [[H1571]] brothers [[H251]] live [[H3427]] in harmony! [[H3162]] 
2 It is like fine [[H2896]] oil [[H8081]] on [[H5921]] the head, [[H7218]] running down [[H3381]] on [[H5921]] the beard, [[H2206]] running down [[H3381]] Aaron’s [[H175]] beard [[H2206]] over [[H5921]] the collar [[H6310]] of his robes. [[H4060]] 
3 It is like the dew [[H2919]] of Hermon [[H2768]] falling [[H3381]] on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2042]] of Zion. [[H6726]] For [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] the LORD [[H3068]] has bestowed [[H6680]] the blessing [[H1293]] of life [[H2416]] forevermore. [[H5704]]
