[[Psalms 75|←]] • [[Psalms 77|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] With stringed instruments. [[H5058]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]] A Song. [[H7892]] God [[H430]] is known [[H3045]] in Judah; [[H3063]] His name [[H8034]] is great [[H1419]] in Israel. [[H3478]] 
2 His tent [[H5520]] is [[H1961]] in Salem, [[H8004]] His dwelling place [[H4585]] in Zion. [[H6726]] 
3 There [[H8033]] He shattered [[H7665]] the flaming arrows, [[H7565]] the shield [[H4043]] and sword [[H2719]] and weapons of war. [[H4421]] Selah [[H5542]] 
4 You [[H859]] are resplendent with light, [[H215]] more majestic [[H117]] than mountains [[H2042]] filled with game. [[H2964]] 
5 The valiant [[H47]] lie plundered; [[H7997]] they sleep [[H5123]] their last sleep. [[H8142]] No [[H3808]] men [[H582]] of might [[H2428]] could lift [[H4672]] a hand. [[H3027]] 
6 At Your rebuke, [[H1606]] O God [[H430]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] both horse [[H5483]] and rider [[H7393]] lie stunned. [[H7290]] 
7 You [[H859]] alone [[H859]] are to be feared. [[H3372]] When [[H227]] You are angry, [[H639]] who [[H4310]] can stand [[H5975]] before You? [[H6440]] 
8 From heaven [[H8064]] You pronounced [[H8085]] judgment, [[H1779]] [and] the earth [[H776]] feared [[H3372]] and was still [[H8252]] 
9 when God [[H430]] rose up [[H6965]] to judge, [[H4941]] to save [[H3467]] all [[H3605]] the lowly [[H6035]] of the earth. [[H776]] Selah [[H5542]] 
10 Even [[H3588]] the wrath [[H2534]] of man [[H120]] shall praise You; [[H3034]] with the survivors [[H7611]] of wrath [[H2534]] You will clothe Yourself. [[H2296]] 
11 Make [[H5087]] and fulfill your vows [[H7999]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] let all [[H3605]] the neighboring lands [[H5439]] bring [[H2986]] tribute [[H7862]] to Him who is to be feared. [[H4172]] 
12 He breaks [[H1219]] the spirits [[H7307]] of princes; [[H5057]] He is feared [[H3372]] by the kings [[H4428]] of the earth. [[H776]]
