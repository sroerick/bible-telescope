[[Psalms 142|←]] • [[Psalms 144|→]]
1 A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] O LORD, [[H3068]] hear [[H8085]] my prayer. [[H8605]] In Your faithfulness, [[H530]] give ear [[H238]] to [[H413]] my plea; [[H8469]] in Your righteousness, [[H6666]] answer me. [[H6030]] 
2 Do not [[H408]] bring [[H935]] Your servant [[H5650]] into judgment, [[H4941]] for [[H3588]] no one [[H3808]] alive [[H2416]] is righteous [[H6663]] before You. [[H6440]] 
3 For [[H3588]] the enemy [[H341]] has pursued [[H7291]] my soul, [[H5315]] crushing [[H1792]] my life [[H2416]] to the ground, [[H776]] making me dwell [[H3427]] in darkness [[H4285]] like those long since [[H5769]] dead. [[H4191]] 
4 My spirit [[H7307]] grows faint [[H5848]] within me; [[H5921]] my heart [[H3820]] is dismayed [[H8074]] inside me. [[H8432]] 
5 I remember [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of old; [[H6924]] I meditate [[H1897]] on all [[H3605]] Your works; [[H6467]] I consider [[H7878]] the work [[H4639]] of Your hands. [[H3027]] 
6 I stretch out [[H6566]] my hands [[H3027]] to You; [[H413]] my soul [[H5315]] thirsts [[H5889]] for you  like a parched land. [[H776]] Selah [[H5542]] 
7 Answer [[H6030]] me quickly, [[H4118]] O LORD; [[H3068]] my spirit [[H7307]] fails. [[H3615]] Do not [[H408]] hide [[H5641]] Your face [[H6440]] from me, [[H4480]] or I will be like those [[H4911]] who go down [[H3381]] to the Pit. [[H953]] 
8 Let me hear [[H8085]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] in the morning, [[H1242]] for [[H3588]] I have put my trust [[H982]] in You.  Teach me [[H3045]] the way [[H1870]] I should walk, [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] to You [[H413]] I lift up [[H5375]] my soul. [[H5315]] 
9 Deliver me [[H5337]] from my enemies, [[H341]] O LORD; [[H3068]] I flee to You [[H413]] for refuge. [[H3680]] 
10 Teach [[H3925]] me to do [[H6213]] Your will, [[H7522]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are my God. [[H433]] May Your good [[H2896]] Spirit [[H7307]] lead [[H5148]] me on level [[H4334]] ground. [[H776]] 
11 For the sake [[H4616]] of Your name, [[H8034]] O LORD, [[H3068]] revive me. [[H2421]] In Your righteousness, [[H6666]] bring [[H3318]] my soul [[H5315]] out of trouble. [[H6869]] 
12 And in Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] cut off [[H6789]] my enemies. [[H341]] Wipe out [[H6]] all [[H3605]] who afflict [[H6887]] me, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am Your servant. [[H5650]]
