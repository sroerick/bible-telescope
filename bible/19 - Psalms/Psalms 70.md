# Psalms 70
[[Psalms 69|←]] • [[Psalms 71|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] Of David. [[H1732]] To bring remembrance. [[H2142]] [Make haste], O God, [[H430]] to deliver me! [[H5337]] Hurry, [[H2363]] O LORD, [[H3068]] to help me! [[H5833]] 
2 May those who seek [[H1245]] my life [[H5315]] be ashamed [[H954]] and confounded; [[H2659]] may those who wish [[H2655]] me harm [[H7451]] be repelled [[H5472]] and humiliated. [[H3637]] 
3 May those who say, [[H559]] “Aha, [[H1889]] aha!” [[H1889]] retreat [[H7725]] because of [[H5921]] their shame. [[H1322]] 
4 May all [[H3605]] who seek You [[H1245]] rejoice [[H7797]] and be glad [[H8055]] in You;  may those who love [[H157]] Your salvation [[H3444]] ever [[H8548]] say, [[H559]] “Let God [[H430]] be magnified!” [[H1431]] 
5 I [[H589]] am poor [[H6041]] and needy; [[H34]] hurry [[H2363]] to me,  O God. [[H430]] You [[H859]] are my help [[H5828]] and my deliverer; [[H6403]] O LORD, [[H3068]] do not [[H408]] delay. [[H309]]
