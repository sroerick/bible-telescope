[[Psalms 64|←]] • [[Psalms 66|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] A Song. [[H7892]] Praise [[H8416]] awaits You, [[H1747]] O God, [[H430]] in Zion; [[H6726]] to You  our vows [[H5088]] will be fulfilled. [[H7999]] 
2 O You who listen to [[H8085]] prayer, [[H8605]] all [[H3605]] men [[H1320]] will come [[H935]] to You. [[H5704]] 
3 When iniquities [[H1697]] prevail [[H1396]] against me, [[H4480]] You alone [[H859]] atone for [[H3722]] our transgressions. [[H6588]] 
4 Blessed [[H835]] is the one You choose [[H977]] and bring near [[H7126]] to dwell [[H7931]] in Your courts! [[H2691]] We are filled [[H7646]] with the goodness [[H2898]] of Your house, [[H1004]] the holiness [[H6918]] of Your temple. [[H1964]] 
5 With awesome deeds [[H3372]] of righteousness [[H6664]] You answer us, [[H6030]] O God [[H430]] of our salvation, [[H3468]] the hope [[H4009]] of all [[H3605]] the ends [[H7099]] of the earth [[H776]] and of the farthest [[H7350]] seas. [[H3220]] 
6 You formed [[H3559]] the mountains [[H2022]] by Your power, [[H3581]] having girded Yourself [[H247]] with might. [[H1369]] 
7 You stilled [[H7623]] the roaring [[H7588]] of the seas, [[H3220]] the pounding [[H7588]] of their waves, [[H1530]] and the tumult [[H1995]] of the nations. [[H3816]] 
8 Those who live [[H3427]] far away [[H7098]] fear [[H3372]] Your wonders; [[H226]] You make the dawn [[H4161]] and sunset [[H6153]] shout for joy. [[H7442]] 
9 You attend to [[H6485]] the earth [[H776]] and water it; [[H7783]] with abundance [[H7227]] You enrich it. [[H6238]] The streams [[H6388]] of God [[H430]] are full [[H4390]] of water, [[H4325]] for [[H3588]] You prepare [[H3559]] our grain [[H1715]] by providing [[H3559]] for [the earth]. [[H3651]] 
10 You soak [[H7301]] its furrows [[H8525]] and level [[H5181]] its ridges; [[H1417]] You soften it [[H4127]] with showers [[H7241]] and bless [[H1288]] its growth, [[H6780]] 
11 You crown [[H5849]] the year [[H8141]] with Your bounty, [[H2896]] and Your paths [[H4570]] overflow [[H7491]] with plenty. [[H1880]] 
12 The pastures [[H4999]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] overflow; [[H7491]] the hills [[H1389]] are robed [[H2296]] with joy. [[H1524]] 
13 The pastures [[H3733]] are clothed [[H3847]] with flocks, [[H6629]] and the valleys [[H6010]] are decked [[H5848]] with grain. [[H1250]] They shout in triumph; [[H7321]] indeed, [[H637]] they sing. [[H7891]]
