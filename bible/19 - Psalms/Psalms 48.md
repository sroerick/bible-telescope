# Psalms 48
[[Psalms 47|←]] • [[Psalms 49|→]]
1 A Song. [[H7892]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] Great is [[H1419]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and greatly [[H3966]] to be praised, [[H1984]] in the city [[H5892]] of our God, [[H430]] His holy [[H6944]] mountain. [[H2022]] 
2 Beautiful [[H3303]] in loftiness, [[H5131]] the joy [[H4885]] of all [[H3605]] the earth, [[H776]] like the peaks [[H3411]] of Zaphron [[H6828]] [is] Mount [[H2022]] Zion, [[H6726]] the city [[H7151]] of the great [[H7227]] King. [[H4428]] 
3 God [[H430]] is in her citadels; [[H759]] He has shown Himself [[H3045]] a fortress. [[H4869]] 
4 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the kings [[H4428]] assembled; [[H3259]] they all advanced [[H5674]] together. [[H3162]] 
5 They [[H1992]] saw [[H7200]] and [[H3651]] were astounded; [[H8539]] they fled [[H2648]] in terror. [[H926]] 
6 Trembling [[H7461]] seized [[H270]] them there, [[H8033]] anguish [[H2427]] like a woman in labor. [[H3205]] 
7 With a wind [[H7307]] from the east [[H6921]] You wrecked [[H7665]] the ships [[H591]] of Tarshish. [[H8659]] 
8 As [[H834]] we have heard, [[H8085]] so [[H3651]] we have seen [[H7200]] in the city [[H5892]] of the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] in the city [[H5892]] of our God: [[H430]] God [[H430]] will establish her [[H3559]] forever. [[H5704]] Selah [[H5542]] 
9 Within [[H7130]] Your temple, [[H1964]] O God, [[H430]] we contemplate [[H1819]] Your loving devotion. [[H2617]] 
10 Your name, [[H8034]] O God, [[H430]] like Your praise, [[H8416]] reaches to [[H5921]] the ends [[H7099]] of the earth; [[H776]] Your right hand [[H3225]] is full [[H4390]] of righteousness. [[H6664]] 
11 Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] is glad, [[H8055]] the towns [[H1323]] of Judah [[H3063]] rejoice, [[H1523]] on account of [[H4616]] Your judgments. [[H4941]] 
12 March around [[H5437]] Zion, [[H6726]] encircle her, [[H5362]] count [[H5608]] her towers, [[H4026]] 
13 consider [[H7896]] her ramparts, [[H2430]] tour [[H6448]] her citadels, [[H759]] that [[H4616]] you may tell [[H5608]] the next [[H314]] generation. [[H1755]] 
14 For [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] God [[H430]] [is] our God [[H430]] forever [[H5769]] and ever; [[H5703]] He [[H1931]] will be our guide [[H5090]] even until [[H5921]] death. [[H4192]]
