[[Psalms 107|←]] • [[Psalms 109|→]]
1 A Song. [[H7892]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] My heart [[H3820]] is steadfast, [[H3559]] O God; [[H430]] I will sing [[H7891]] and make music [[H2167]] with [[H637]] all my being. [[H3519]] 
2 Awake, [[H5782]] O harp [[H5035]] and lyre! [[H3658]] I will awaken [[H5782]] the dawn. [[H7837]] 
3 I will praise You, [[H3034]] O LORD, [[H3068]] among the peoples; [[H5971]] I will sing Your praises [[H2167]] among [[H1077]] the nations. [[H3816]] 
4 For [[H3588]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] is higher [[H1419]] than the heavens, [[H8064]] and Your truth [[H571]] reaches [[H5704]] to the skies. [[H7834]] 
5 Be exalted, [[H7311]] O God, [[H430]] above [[H5921]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and let Your glory [[H3519]] cover [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]] 
6 That [[H4616]] Your beloved [[H3039]] may be delivered, [[H2502]] save [me] [[H3467]] by Your right hand [[H3225]] and answer me! [[H6030]] 
7 God [[H430]] has spoken [[H1696]] in His sanctuary: [[H6944]] “I will triumph! [[H5937]] I will parcel out [[H2505]] Shechem, [[H7927]] and apportion [[H4058]] the Valley [[H6010]] of Succoth. [[H5523]] 
8 Gilead is Mine, [[H1568]] Manasseh is Mine; [[H4519]] Ephraim [[H669]] is My helmet [[H4581]] and Judah [[H3063]] My scepter. [[H2710]] 
9 Moab [[H4124]] is My washbasin; [[H5518]] on [[H5921]] Edom [[H123]] I toss [[H7993]] My sandal; [[H5275]] over [[H5921]] Philistia [[H6429]] I shout in triumph.” [[H7321]] 
10 Who [[H4310]] will bring [[H2986]] me to the fortified [[H4013]] city? [[H5892]] Who [[H4310]] will lead [[H5148]] me to [[H5704]] Edom? [[H123]] 
11 Have You [[H3808]] rejected us, [[H2186]] O God? [[H430]] Do You no longer [[H3808]] march out, [[H3318]] O God, [[H430]] with our armies? [[H6635]] 
12 Give [[H3051]] us  aid [[H5833]] against the foe, [[H6862]] for the help [[H8668]] of man [[H120]] is worthless. [[H7723]] 
13 With God [[H430]] we perform [[H6213]] with valor, [[H2428]] and He [[H1931]] will trample [[H947]] our enemies. [[H6862]]
