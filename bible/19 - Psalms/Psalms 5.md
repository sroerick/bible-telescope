# Psalms 5
[[Psalms 4|←]] • [[Psalms 6|→]]
1 For the choirmaster, [[H5329]] to be accompanied by [[H413]] flutes. [[H5155]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] Give ear [[H238]] to my words, [[H561]] O LORD; [[H3068]] consider [[H995]] my groaning. [[H1901]] 
2 Attend to [[H7181]] the sound [[H6963]] of my cry, [[H7773]] my King [[H4428]] and my God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] to You [[H413]] I pray. [[H6419]] 
3 In the morning, [[H1242]] O LORD, [[H3068]] You hear [[H8085]] my voice; [[H6963]] at daybreak [[H1242]] I lay [my plea] [[H6186]] before You  and wait in expectation. [[H6822]] 
4 For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are not [[H3808]] a God [[H410]] who delights [[H2655]] in wickedness; [[H7562]] no [[H3808]] evil [[H7451]] can dwell with You. [[H1481]] 
5 The boastful [[H1984]] cannot [[H3808]] stand [[H3320]] in Your presence; [[H5869]] You hate [[H8130]] all [[H3605]] workers [[H6466]] of iniquity. [[H205]] 
6 You destroy [[H6]] those who tell [[H1696]] lies; [[H3577]] the LORD [[H3068]] abhors [[H8581]] the man [[H376]] of bloodshed [[H1818]] and deceit. [[H4820]] 
7 But I, [[H589]] by the abundance [[H7230]] of Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] will enter [[H935]] Your house; [[H1004]] in reverence [[H3374]] I will bow down [[H7812]] toward [[H413]] Your holy [[H6944]] temple. [[H1964]] 
8 Lead me, [[H5148]] O LORD, [[H3068]] in Your righteousness [[H6666]] because of [[H4616]] my enemies; [[H8324]] make straight [[H3474]] Your way [[H1870]] before me. [[H6440]] 
9 For [[H3588]] not a word [[H369]] they speak [[H6310]] can be trusted; [[H3559]] destruction [[H1942]] is within them. [[H7130]] Their throats [[H1627]] are open [[H6605]] graves; [[H6913]] their tongues [[H3956]] practice flattery. [[H2505]] 
10 Declare them guilty, [[H816]] O God; [[H430]] let them fall [[H5307]] by their own devices. [[H4156]] Drive them out [[H5080]] for their many [[H7230]] transgressions, [[H6588]] for [[H3588]] they have rebelled against You. [[H4784]] 
11 But let all [[H3605]] who take refuge [[H2620]] in You  rejoice; [[H8055]] let them ever shout for joy. [[H7442]] May You shelter [[H5526]] them, [[H5921]] that those who love [[H157]] Your name [[H8034]] may rejoice [[H5970]] in You.  
12 For surely [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] bless [[H1288]] the righteous; [[H6662]] You surround them [[H5849]] with the shield [[H6793]] of your favor. [[H7522]]
