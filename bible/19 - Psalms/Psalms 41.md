# Psalms 41
[[Psalms 40|←]] • [[Psalms 42|→]]
1 For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] Blessed [[H835]] [is] he who cares [[H7919]] for [[H413]] the poor; [[H1800]] the LORD [[H3068]] will deliver him [[H4422]] in the day [[H3117]] of trouble. [[H7451]] 
2 The LORD [[H3068]] will protect [[H8104]] and preserve him; [[H2421]] He will bless him [[H833]] in the land [[H776]] and will not [[H408]] surrender him [[H5414]] to the will [[H5315]] of his foes. [[H341]] 
3 The LORD [[H3068]] will sustain [[H5582]] him on [[H5921]] his bed [[H6210]] of illness [[H1741]] and restore him [[H2015]] from his bed [[H4904]] of sickness. [[H2483]] 
4 I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] be gracious to me; [[H2603]] heal [[H7495]] me, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] I have sinned against You.” [[H2398]] 
5 My enemies [[H341]] say [[H559]] with malice: [[H7451]] “When [[H4970]] will he die [[H4191]] and be forgotten?” [[H6]] 
6 My visitor [[H518]] speaks [[H1696]] falsehood; [[H7723]] he gathers [[H6908]] slander [[H205]] in his heart; [[H3820]] he goes [[H3318]] out [[H2351]] and spreads it abroad. [[H1696]] 
7 All [[H3605]] who hate [[H8130]] me [[H5921]] whisper [[H3907]] against me; [[H5921]] they imagine [[H2803]] the worst [[H7451]] for me:  
8 “A vile [[H1100]] disease [[H1697]] has been poured [[H3332]] into him;  he will never [[H3808]] get up [[H6965]] from where [[H834]] he lies!” [[H7901]] 
9 Even [[H1571]] my close friend, [[H376]] whom [[H834]] I trusted, [[H982]] he who shared [[H398]] my bread, [[H3899]] has lifted up [[H1431]] [his] heel [[H6119]] against me. [[H5921]] 
10 But You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3069]] be gracious to me [[H2603]] and raise me up, [[H6965]] that I may repay [[H7999]] them. [[H1992]] 
11 By this [[H2063]] I know [[H3045]] You delight [[H2654]] in me,  for [[H3588]] my enemy [[H341]] does not [[H3808]] triumph [[H7321]] over me. [[H5921]] 
12 In my [[H589]] integrity [[H8537]] You uphold [[H8551]] me  and set me [[H5324]] in Your presence [[H6440]] forever. [[H5769]] 
13 Blessed be [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] from everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting. [[H5769]] Amen [[H543]] and Amen. [[H543]]
