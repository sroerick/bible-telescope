# Psalms 91
[[Psalms 90|←]] • [[Psalms 92|→]]
1 He who dwells [[H3427]] in the shelter [[H5643]] of the Most High [[H5945]] will abide [[H3885]] in the shadow [[H6738]] of the Almighty. [[H7706]] 
2 I will say [[H559]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] “[You are] my refuge [[H4268]] and fortress, [[H4686]] my God, [[H430]] in whom I trust.” [[H982]] 
3 Surely [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] will deliver you [[H5337]] from the snare [[H6341]] of the fowler, [[H3353]] and from the deadly [[H1942]] plague. [[H1698]] 
4 He will cover [[H5526]] you with His feathers; [[H84]] under [[H8478]] His wings [[H3671]] you will find refuge; [[H2620]] His faithfulness [[H571]] is a shield [[H6793]] and rampart. [[H5507]] 
5 You will not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] the terror [[H6343]] of the night, [[H3915]] or the arrow [[H2671]] that flies [[H5774]] by day, [[H3119]] 
6 the plague [[H1698]] that stalks [[H1980]] in darkness, [[H652]] or the calamity [[H6986]] that destroys [[H7736]] at noon. [[H6672]] 
7 Though a thousand [[H505]] may fall [[H5307]] at your side, [[H6654]] and ten thousand [[H7233]] at your right hand, [[H3225]] no [harm] [[H3808]] will come near [[H413]] you. [[H5066]] 
8 You will only [[H7535]] see it [[H5027]] with your eyes [[H5869]] and witness [[H7200]] the punishment [[H8011]] of the wicked. [[H7563]] 
9 Because [[H3588]] you [[H859]] have made [[H7760]] the LORD [[H3068]] your dwelling— [[H4583]] my refuge, [[H4268]] the Most High— [[H5945]] 
10 no [[H3808]] evil [[H7451]] will befall [[H579]] you, [[H413]] no [[H3808]] plague [[H5061]] will approach [[H7126]] your tent. [[H168]] 
11 For [[H3588]] He will command [[H6680]] His angels [[H4397]] concerning you  to guard you [[H8104]] in all [[H3605]] your ways. [[H1870]] 
12 They will lift you up [[H5375]] in [[H5921]] their hands, [[H3709]] so that you will not [[H6435]] strike [[H5062]] your foot [[H7272]] against a stone. [[H68]] 
13 You will tread [[H1869]] on [[H5921]] the lion [[H7826]] and cobra; [[H6620]] you will trample [[H7429]] the young lion [[H3715]] and serpent. [[H8577]] 
14 “Because [[H3588]] he loves Me, [[H2836]] I will deliver him; [[H6403]] because [[H3588]] he knows [[H3045]] My name, [[H8034]] I will protect him. [[H7682]] 
15 When he calls out to Me, [[H7121]] I will answer him; [[H6030]] I [[H595]] will be with [[H5973]] him in trouble. [[H6869]] I will deliver [[H2502]] and honor him. [[H3513]] 
16 With long [[H753]] life [[H3117]] I will satisfy him [[H7646]] and show [[H7200]] him My salvation.” [[H3444]]
