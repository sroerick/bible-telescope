1 Now the wife [[H802]] of one [[H259]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] “Your servant, [[H5650]] my husband, [[H376]] is dead, [[H4191]] and you [[H859]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] your servant [[H5650]] feared [[H3372]] the LORD. [[H3068]] And now his creditor [[H5383]] is coming [[H935]] to take [[H3947]] my two [[H8147]] children [[H3206]] as his slaves! [[H5650]] 
2 “How [[H4100]] can I [[H6213]] help you?”  asked [[H559]] Elisha. [[H477]] “Tell me, [[H5046]] what [[H4100]] do you have [[H3426]] in the house?” [[H1004]] She answered, [[H559]] “Your servant [[H8198]] has nothing [[H369]] in the house [[H1004]] but [[H518]] a jar [[H610]] of oil.” [[H8081]] 
3 “Go,” [[H1980]] said [Elisha], [[H559]] “borrow [[H7592]] empty [[H7386]] jars [[H3627]] from [[H4480]] all [[H3605]] your neighbors. [[H7934]] Do not [[H408]] gather just a few. [[H4591]] 
4 Then go inside, [[H935]] shut [[H5462]] the door [[H1817]] behind you [[H1157]] and [[H1157]] your sons, [[H1121]] and pour [[H3332]] oil into [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] jars, [[H3627]] setting the full ones [[H4392]] aside.” [[H5265]] 
5 So she left [[H1980]] him, [[H853]] and after she had shut [[H5462]] the door [[H1817]] behind her [[H1157]] and [[H1157]] her sons, [[H1121]] they [[H1992]] kept bringing [jars] [[H5066]] to her, [[H413]] and she [[H1931]] kept pouring. [[H3332]] 
6 When [[H1961]] all the jars [[H3627]] were full, [[H4390]] she said [[H559]] to [[H413]] her son, [[H1121]] “Bring [[H5066]] me another.” [[H5750]] But he replied, [[H559]] “There are no [[H369]] more [[H5750]] jars.” [[H3627]] Then the oil [[H8081]] stopped flowing. [[H5975]] 
7 She went [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and he said, [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] sell [[H4376]] the oil [[H8081]] and pay [[H7999]] your debt, [[H5386]] and you [[H859]] and your sons [[H1121]] can live [[H2421]] on the remainder.” [[H3498]] 
8 One day [[H3117]] Elisha [[H477]] went [[H5674]] to [[H413]] Shunem, [[H7766]] and a prominent [[H1419]] woman [[H802]] who lived there [[H8033]] persuaded [[H2388]] him  to have a meal. [[H398]] So whenever [[H1961]] he would pass by, [[H5674]] he would stop [[H5493]] there [[H8033]] to eat. [[H398]] 
9 Then [the woman] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] her husband, [[H376]] “Behold, [[H2009]] now [[H4994]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the one [[H1931]] who often [[H8548]] comes our way [[H5674]] is a holy [[H6918]] man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] 
10 Please [[H4994]] let us make [[H6213]] a small [[H6996]] room upstairs [[H5944]] and put [[H7760]] in it [[H8033]] a bed, [[H4296]] a table, [[H7979]] a chair, [[H3678]] and a lamp [[H4501]] for him.  Then when he comes [[H935]] to us, [[H413]] he can stay [[H5493]] there.” [[H8033]] 
11 One day [[H3117]] [Elisha] came to visit [[H935]] and went [[H5493]] to [[H413]] his upper room [[H5944]] to lie down. [[H7901]] 
12 And he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Gehazi [[H1522]] his servant, [[H5288]] “Call [[H7121]] the [[H2063]] Shunammite woman.” [[H7767]] And when he had called [[H7121]] her,  she stood [[H5975]] before him, [[H6440]] 
13 and [Elisha] said [[H559]] to Gehazi,  “Now [[H4994]] tell [[H559]] her, [[H413]] ‘Look, [[H2009]] you have gone to all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] trouble [[H2729]] for us. [[H413]] What [[H4100]] can we do for you? [[H6213]] Can we speak [[H1696]] on your behalf to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] or [[H176]] the commander [[H8269]] of the army?’” [[H6635]] “I [[H595]] have a home [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] my own people,” [[H5971]] she replied. [[H559]] 
14 So he asked, [[H559]] “Then what [[H4100]] should be done [[H6213]] for her?”  “Well, [[H61]] she has  no [[H369]] son,” [[H1121]] Gehazi [[H1522]] replied, [[H559]] “and her husband [[H376]] is old.” [[H2204]] 
15 “Call [[H7121]] her,”  said Elisha. [[H559]] So Gehazi called [[H7121]] her,  and she stood [[H5975]] in the doorway. [[H6607]] 
16 And Elisha declared, [[H559]] “At this [[H2088]] time [[H4150]] next year, [[H6256]] you [[H859]] will hold [[H2263]] a son {in your arms}.” [[H1121]] “No, [[H408]] my lord,” [[H113]] she said. [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] lie [[H3576]] to your maidservant, [[H8198]] O man [[H376]] of God.” [[H430]] 
17 But the woman [[H802]] did conceive, [[H2029]] and at that [[H2088]] time [[H4150]] the next year [[H6256]] she gave birth to [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] just as [[H834]] Elisha [[H477]] had told [[H1696]] her. [[H413]] 
18 And [[H1961]] the child [[H3206]] grew, [[H1431]] and one day [[H3117]] he went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] who was with [[H413]] the harvesters. [[H7114]] 
19 “My head! [[H7218]] My head!” [[H7218]] he complained [[H559]] to [[H413]] his father. [[H1]] So his father told [[H559]] a servant, [[H5288]] “Carry him [[H5375]] to [[H413]] his mother.” [[H517]] 
20 After [the servant] had picked him up [[H5375]] and carried him [[H935]] to [[H413]] his mother, [[H517]] [the boy] sat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] her lap [[H1290]] until [[H5704]] noon, [[H6672]] and then he died. [[H4191]] 
21 And she went up [[H5927]] and laid [[H7901]] him on [[H5921]] the bed [[H4296]] of the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] Then she shut [the door] [[H5462]] and went out. [[H3318]] 
22 And the woman called [[H7121]] her husband [[H376]] and said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] send [[H7971]] me  one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] the servants [[H5288]] and one [[H259]] of the donkeys, [[H860]] that I may go quickly [[H7323]] to [[H5704]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] and return.” [[H7725]] 
23 “Why [[H4069]] would you [[H859]] go [[H1980]] to him [[H413]] today?” [[H3117]] he replied. [[H559]] “It is not [[H3808]] a New Moon [[H2320]] or a Sabbath.” [[H7676]] “Everything is all right,” [[H7965]] she said. [[H559]] 
24 Then she saddled [[H2280]] the donkey [[H860]] and told [[H559]] her servant, [[H5288]] “Drive [[H5090]] onward; [[H1980]] do not [[H408]] slow [[H6113]] the pace [[H7392]] for me  unless [[H518]] I tell [[H559]] you.”  
25 So she set out [[H1980]] and went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] at [[H413]] Mount [[H2022]] Carmel. [[H3760]] When the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] saw [[H7200]] her [[H853]] at a distance, [[H5048]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his servant [[H5288]] Gehazi, [[H1522]] “Look, [[H2009]] there is [[H1975]] the Shunammite woman. [[H7767]] 
26 Please [[H4994]] run out [[H7323]] now [[H6258]] to meet her [[H7125]] and ask, [[H559]] ‘Are you all right? [[H7965]] Is your husband [[H376]] all right? [[H7965]] Is your child [[H3206]] all right?’” [[H7965]] And she answered, [[H559]] “Everything is all right.” [[H7965]] 
27 When she reached [[H935]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] at [[H413]] the mountain, [[H2022]] she clung [[H2388]] to his feet. [[H7272]] Gehazi [[H1522]] came over [[H5066]] to push her away, [[H1920]] but the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Leave her alone, [[H7503]] for [[H3588]] her soul [[H5315]] [is] in deep distress,  and the LORD [[H3069]] has hidden [[H5956]] it from me [[H4480]] and has not [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] me.  
28 Then she said, [[H559]] “Did I ask my lord [[H113]] for [[H7592]] a son? [[H1121]] Didn’t [[H3808]] I say, [[H559]] ‘Do not [[H3808]] deceive me?’” [[H7952]] 
29 So Elisha said [[H559]] to Gehazi, [[H1522]] “Tie up [[H2296]] your garment, [[H4975]] take [[H3947]] my staff [[H4938]] in your hand, [[H3027]] and go! [[H1980]] If [[H3588]] you meet [[H4672]] anyone, [[H376]] do not [[H3808]] greet him, [[H1288]] and if [[H3588]] anyone [[H376]] greets you, [[H1288]] do not [[H3808]] answer him. [[H6030]] Then lay [[H7760]] my staff [[H4938]] on [[H5921]] the boys [[H5288]] face. [[H6440]] 
30 And the mother [[H517]] of the boy [[H5288]] said, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives [[H2416]] and as you yourself [[H5315]] live, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] leave you.” [[H5800]] So he got up [[H6965]] and followed [[H1980]] her. [[H310]] 
31 Gehazi [[H1522]] went on [[H5674]] ahead of them [[H6440]] and laid [[H7760]] the staff [[H4938]] on [[H5921]] the boy’s [[H5288]] face, [[H6440]] but there was no [[H369]] sound [[H6963]] [or] [[H369]] response. [[H7182]] So he went back [[H7725]] to meet [Elisha] [[H7125]] and told him, [[H5046]] “The boy [[H5288]] has not [[H3808]] awakened.” [[H6974]] 
32 When Elisha [[H477]] reached [[H935]] the house, [[H1004]] there was [[H2009]] the boy [[H5288]] lying [[H7901]] dead [[H4191]] on [[H5921]] his bed. [[H4296]] 
33 So he went in, [[H935]] closed [[H5462]] the door [[H1817]] behind [[H1157]] the two of them, [[H8147]] and prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
34 Then [Elisha] got on the bed [[H5927]] and lay [[H7901]] on [[H5921]] the boy, [[H3206]] mouth [[H6310]] to [[H5921]] mouth, [[H6310]] eye [[H5869]] to [[H5921]] eye, [[H5869]] and hands [[H3709]] to [[H5921]] hands. [[H3709]] As he stretched himself out [[H1457]] over him, [[H5921]] the boy’s [[H3206]] body [[H1320]] became warm. [[H2552]] 
35 Elisha turned away [[H7725]] and paced [[H1980]] back and forth [[H259]] across the room. [[H1004]] Then he got on the bed [[H5927]] and stretched himself out [[H1457]] over [the boy] again, [[H5921]] and the boy [[H5288]] sneezed [[H2237]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] and opened [[H6491]] his eyes. [[H5869]] 
36 Elisha summoned [[H7121]] Gehazi [[H1522]] and said, [[H559]] “Call [[H7121]] the [[H2063]] Shunammite woman.” [[H7767]] So he called [[H7121]] her and she came. [[H935]] Then Elisha said, [[H559]] “Pick up [[H5375]] your son.” [[H1121]] 
37 She came in, [[H935]] fell [[H5307]] at [[H5921]] his feet, [[H7272]] and bowed [[H7812]] to the ground. [[H776]] Then she picked up [[H5375]] her son [[H1121]] and went out. [[H3318]] 
38 When Elisha [[H477]] returned [[H7725]] to Gilgal, [[H1537]] there was a famine [[H7458]] in the land. [[H776]] As the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] were sitting [[H3427]] at his feet, [[H6440]] he said [[H559]] to his attendant, [[H5288]] “Put on [[H8239]] the large [[H1419]] pot [[H5518]] and boil [[H1310]] some stew [[H5138]] for the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets.” [[H5030]] 
39 One [of them] [[H259]] went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the field [[H7704]] to gather [[H3950]] herbs, [[H219]] and he found [[H4672]] a wild [[H7704]] vine [[H1612]] from [[H4480]] which he gathered [[H3950]] as many wild [[H7704]] gourds [[H6498]] as his garment [could hold. [[H899]] Then he came back [[H935]] and cut them up [[H6398]] into [[H413]] the pot [[H5518]] of stew, [[H5138]] though [[H3588]] no one [[H3808]] knew [what they were]. [[H3045]] 
40 And they poured it out [[H3332]] for the men [[H376]] to eat, [[H398]] but when they tasted [[H398]] the stew [[H5138]] they [[H1992]] cried out, [[H6817]] “There is death [[H4194]] in the pot, [[H5518]] O man [[H376]] of God!” [[H430]] And they could not [[H3808]] eat [it]. [[H398]] 
41 Then Elisha said, [[H559]] “Get [[H3947]] some flour.” [[H7058]] He threw [[H7993]] it into [[H413]] the pot [[H5518]] and said, [[H559]] “Pour it out [[H3332]] for the people [[H5971]] to eat.” [[H398]] And there was [[H1961]] nothing [[H3808]] harmful [[H7451]] in the pot. [[H5518]] 
42 Now a man [[H376]] from  Baal-shalishah [[H1190]] came [[H935]] to the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] with a sack [[H6861]] of twenty [[H6242]] loaves [[H3899]] of barley [[H8184]] bread [[H3899]] from the first [[H1061]] ripe grain. [[H3759]] “Give [[H5414]] it to the people [[H5971]] to eat,” [[H398]] said Elisha. [[H559]] 
43 But his servant [[H8334]] asked, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] am I to set [[H5414]] twenty loaves [[H2088]] before [[H6440]] a hundred [[H3967]] men?” [[H376]] “Give [[H5414]] it to the people [[H5971]] to eat,” [[H398]] said Elisha, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘They will eat [[H398]] and have [some] left over.’” [[H3498]] 
44 So he set [it] [[H5414]] before them, [[H6440]] and they ate [[H398]] and had [some] left over, [[H3498]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
