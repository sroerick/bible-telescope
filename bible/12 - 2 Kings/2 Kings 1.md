1 After [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Ahab, [[H256]] Moab [[H4124]] rebelled [[H6586]] against Israel. [[H3478]] 
2 Now Ahaziah [[H274]] had fallen [[H5307]] through [[H1157]] the lattice [[H7639]] of his upper room [[H5944]] in Samaria [[H8111]] and injured himself. [[H2470]] So he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] and instructed them: [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] inquire [[H1875]] of Baal-zebub, [[H1176]] the god [[H430]] of Ekron, [[H6138]] whether [[H518]] I will recover [[H2421]] from this [[H2088]] injury.” [[H2483]] 
3 But the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite, [[H8664]] “Go up [[H5927]] to meet [[H7125]] the messengers [[H4397]] of the king [[H4428]] of Samaria [[H8111]] and ask them, [[H1696]] ‘[Is [it] because [[H1097]] [there is] no [[H369]] God [[H430]] in Israel [[H3478]] that you [[H859]] are on your way [[H1980]] to inquire [[H1875]] of Baal-zebub, [[H1176]] the god [[H430]] of Ekron? [[H6138]] 
4 Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘You will not [[H3808]] get up [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the bed [[H4296]] on which [[H834]] you are lying. [[H5927]] You will surely die.’” [[H4191]] So Elijah [[H452]] departed. [[H1980]] 
5 When the messengers [[H4397]] returned [[H7725]] to the king, [[H413]] he asked them, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] have you returned?” [[H7725]] 
6 They replied, [[H559]] “A man [[H376]] came up [[H5927]] to meet us [[H7125]] and said, [[H559]] ‘Go [[H1980]] back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] who [[H834]] sent [[H7971]] you [[H853]] and tell [[H1696]] him [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Is it because [[H4480]] there is no [[H1097]] God [[H430]] in Israel [[H3478]] that you are [[H859]] sending [[H7971]] these men to inquire [[H1875]] of Baal-zebub, [[H1176]] the god [[H430]] of Ekron? [[H6138]] Therefore [[H3651]] you will not [[H3808]] get up [[H3381]] from the bed [[H4296]] on which [[H834]] you are lying. [[H5927]] You will surely die. [[H4191]] 
7 The king asked them, [[H1696]] “What [[H4100]] sort [[H4941]] of man [[H376]] came up [[H5927]] to meet [[H7125]] you and spoke [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to you?” [[H413]] 
8 “[He was] a hairy [[H8181]] man,” [[H376]] they answered, [[H559]] “with a leather [[H5785]] belt [[H232]] around his waist.” [[H4975]] “It is [[H1931]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite,” [[H8664]] said [the king]. [[H559]] 
9 Then King Ahaziah sent [[H7971]] to Elijah [[H413]] a captain [[H8269]] with his company of fifty men. [[H2572]] So the captain went up [[H5927]] to [Elijah], [[H413]] who was sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] top [[H7218]] of a hill, [[H2022]] and said [[H1696]] to him, [[H413]] “Man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] the king [[H4428]] declares, [[H1696]] ‘Come down!’” [[H3381]] 
10 Elijah [[H452]] answered [[H6030]] the captain, [[H8269]] “If [[H518]] I [[H589]] am a man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] may fire [[H784]] come down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] and consume [[H398]] you [[H853]] and [[H853]] [your] fifty [men].” [[H2572]] And fire [[H784]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] and consumed [[H398]] [the captain] [[H853]] and his men. [[H2572]] 
11 So the king sent [[H7971]] to Elijah [[H413]] another [[H312]] captain [[H8269]] [with his] fifty [men]. [[H2572]] And [the captain] [[H6030]] said [[H1696]] to [Elijah], [[H413]] “Man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] the king [[H4428]] declares, [[H559]] ‘Come down [[H3381]] at once!’” [[H4120]] 
12 Again Elijah [[H452]] replied, [[H6030]] “If [[H518]] I [[H589]] am a man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] may fire [[H784]] come down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] and consume [[H398]] you [[H853]] and [[H853]] [your] fifty [men].” [[H2572]] And the fire [[H784]] of God [[H430]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] and consumed [[H398]] him [[H853]] and [[H853]] [his] fifty men. [[H2572]] 
13 So [[H7725]] the king sent [[H7971]] a third [[H7992]] captain [[H8269]] with his fifty men. [[H2572]] And the third [[H7992]] captain [[H8269]] went up, [[H5927]] fell [[H3766]] on [[H5921]] his knees [[H1290]] before [[H5048]] Elijah, [[H452]] and begged him, [[H2603]] “Man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] may my life [[H5315]] and the lives [[H5315]] of these [[H428]] fifty [[H2572]] servants [[H5650]] please [[H4994]] be precious [[H3365]] in your sight. [[H5869]] 
14 Behold, [[H2009]] fire [[H784]] has come down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] and consumed [[H398]] the first [[H7223]] two [[H8147]] captains [[H8269]] of fifty, [[H2572]] with all their men. [[H2572]] But now [[H6258]] may my life [[H5315]] be precious [[H3365]] in your sight.” [[H5869]] 
15 Then the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Elijah, [[H452]] “Go down [[H3381]] with him. [[H854]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of him.” [[H6440]] So [Elijah] arose [[H6965]] and went down [[H3381]] with him [[H854]] to [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]] 
16 And Elijah said [[H1696]] to King Ahaziah, [[H413]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Is there really no [[H1097]] God [[H430]] in Israel [[H3478]] for you to inquire [[H1875]] of His word? [[H1697]] Is that why [[H3282]] you have sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to inquire [[H1875]] of  Baal-zebub, [[H1176]] the god [[H430]] of Ekron? [[H6138]] Therefore [[H3651]] you will not [[H3808]] get up from [[H3381]] the bed [[H4296]] on which [[H834]] you are lying. [[H5927]] You will surely die. [[H4191]] 
17 So [Ahaziah] died [[H4191]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] Elijah [[H452]] had spoken. [[H1696]] Since [[H3588]] he had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] son, [[H1121]] Jehoram [[H3088]] succeeded him [[H4427]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] over Judah. [[H3063]] 
18 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Ahaziah, [[H274]] along with his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]
