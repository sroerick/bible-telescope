[[2 Kings 23|←]] • [[2 Kings 25|→]]
1 During Jehoiakim’s reign, [[H3117]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] invaded. [[H5927]] So Jehoiakim [[H3079]] became [[H1961]] his vassal [[H5650]] for three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] until he turned [[H7725]] and rebelled [[H4775]] against [Nebuchadnezzar].  
2 And the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] Chaldean, [[H3778]] Aramean, [[H758]] Moabite, [[H4124]] and Ammonite [[H1121]] [raiders] against Jehoiakim [[H1416]] [in order] [[H7971]] to destroy [[H6]] Judah, [[H3063]] according to the word [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] His servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]] 
3 Surely [[H389]] this happened [[H1961]] to Judah [[H3063]] at [[H5921]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] command, [[H6310]] to remove [[H5493]] them from [[H5921]] His presence [[H6440]] because of the sins [[H2403]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had done, [[H6213]] 
4 and also for [[H1571]] the innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] he had shed. [[H8210]] For he had filled [[H4390]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with innocent [[H5355]] blood, [[H1818]] and the LORD [[H3068]] was unwilling [[H14]] to forgive. [[H5545]] 
5 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoiakim, [[H3079]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] 
6 And Jehoiakim [[H3079]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and his son [[H1121]] Jehoiachin [[H3078]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
7 Now the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] did not [[H3808]] march out [[H3318]] of his land [[H776]] again, [[H3254]] because [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had taken [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] his territory, [[H1961]] from the Brook [[H5158]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to [[H5704]] the Euphrates [[H6578]] River. [[H5104]] 
8 Jehoiachin [[H3078]] was eighteen [[H8083]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] three [[H7969]] months. [[H2320]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Nehushta [[H5179]] daughter [[H1323]] of Elnathan; [[H494]] she was from Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
9 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] his father [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]] 
10 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the servants [[H5650]] of Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] marched up [[H5927]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the city [[H5892]] came [[H935]] under siege. [[H4692]] 
11 And King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] of Babylon [[H894]] came [[H935]] to [[H5921]] the city [[H5892]] while his servants [[H5650]] were besieging it. [[H6696]] 
12 Jehoiachin [[H3078]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] his mother, [[H517]] his servants, [[H5650]] his commanders, [[H8269]] and his officials [[H5631]] [all] surrendered [[H3318]] to [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]] So in the eighth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of [Jehoiachin's] reign, [[H4427]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] took him captive. [[H3947]] 
13 As [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had declared, [[H1696]] [Nebuchadnezzar] also carried off [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] the treasures [[H214]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [and] [[H214]] the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and he cut into pieces [[H7112]] all [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] articles [[H3627]] that [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] had made [[H6213]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
14 He carried into exile [[H1540]] all [[H3605]] Jerusalem— [[H3389]] all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] and [[H853]] mighty warriors, [[H1368]] all [[H3605]] the craftsmen [[H2796]] and metalsmiths— [[H4525]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] captives [in all]. [[H1473]] Only [[H2108]] the poorest [[H1803]] people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] remained. [[H7604]] 
15 Nebuchadnezzar carried away [[H1540]] Jehoiachin [[H3078]] to Babylon, [[H894]] as well as [[H853]] the king’s [[H4428]] mother, [[H517]] [his] [[H4428]] wives, [[H802]] his officials, [[H5631]] and the leading men [[H853]] of the land. [[H776]] He took them into exile [[H1473]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Babylon. [[H894]] 
16 The king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] also brought [[H935]] into exile [[H1473]] to Babylon [[H894]] all [[H3605]] seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] valiant warriors [[H582]] and a thousand [[H505]] craftsmen [[H2796]] and metalsmiths— [[H4525]] all [[H3605]] strong [[H1368]] and fit [[H6213]] for battle. [[H4421]] 
17 Then the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] made Mattaniah, [[H4983]] [Jehoiachin's] uncle, [[H1730]] king [[H4427]] in his place [[H8478]] and changed [[H5437]] his name [[H8034]] to Zedekiah. [[H6667]] 
18 Zedekiah [[H6667]] was twenty-one [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] eleven [[H259]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Hamutal [[H2537]] daughter [[H1323]] of Jeremiah; [[H3414]] she was from Libnah. [[H3841]] 
19 And [Zedekiah] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] had done. [[H6213]] 
20 For [[H3588]] because [[H5921]] of the anger [[H639]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] [all this] happened [[H1961]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah, [[H3063]] until [[H5704]] He finally banished [[H7993]] them [[H853]] from [[H5921]] His presence. [[H6440]] And Zedekiah also [[H6667]] rebelled [[H4775]] against the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]
