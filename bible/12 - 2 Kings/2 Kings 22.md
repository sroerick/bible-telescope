1 Josiah [[H2977]] was eight [[H8083]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] thirty-one [[H7970]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Jedidah [[H3040]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Adaiah; [[H5718]] she was from Bozkath. [[H1218]] 
2 And he did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] of David [[H1732]] his forefather; [[H1]] he did not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left. [[H8040]] 
3 Now [[H1961]] in the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4428]] King [[H4428]] Josiah [[H2977]] sent [[H7971]] the scribe, [[H5608]] Shaphan [[H8227]] son [[H1121]] of Azaliah, [[H683]] the son [[H1121]] of Meshullam, [[H4918]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] 
4 “Go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] and have him count [[H8552]] the money [[H3701]] that has been brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] the doorkeepers [[H5592]] have collected [[H622]] from the people. [[H5971]] 
5 And let them deliver it [[H5414]] into [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of the supervisors [[H6485]] of those doing [[H6213]] the work [[H4399]] on the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] who in turn are to give [[H5414]] it [[H853]] to the workmen [[H6213]] repairing [[H2388]] the damages [[H919]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] 
6 to the carpenters, [[H2796]] builders, [[H1129]] and masons— [[H1443]] to buy [[H7069]] timber [[H6086]] and dressed [[H4274]] stone [[H68]] to repair [[H2388]] the temple. [[H1004]] 
7 But [[H389]] they need not [[H3808]] account [[H2803]] for the money [[H3701]] put [[H5414]] into [[H5921]] their hands, [[H3027]] since [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] work [[H6213]] with integrity.” [[H530]] 
8 Then Hilkiah [[H2518]] the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] said to [[H559]] Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] “I have found [[H4672]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD!” [[H3068]] And he [[H2518]] gave [[H5414]] [it] [[H5612]] to [[H413]] Shaphan, [[H8227]] who read it. [[H7121]] 
9 And Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe [[H5608]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] and reported, [[H7725]] “Your servants [[H5650]] have paid out [[H5413]] the money [[H3701]] that was found [[H4672]] in the temple [[H1004]] and have put [[H5414]] it into [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of the workers [[H6213]] and supervisors [[H6485]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
10 Moreover, Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe [[H5608]] told [[H5046]] the king, [[H4428]] “Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest [[H3548]] has given [[H5414]] me  a book.” [[H5612]] And Shaphan [[H8227]] read it [[H7121]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the king. [[H4428]] 
11 When the king [[H4428]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the Book [[H5612]] of the Law, [[H8451]] he tore [[H7167]] his clothes [[H899]] 
12 [and] [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest, [[H3548]] Ahikam [[H296]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] Achbor [[H5907]] son [[H1121]] of Micaiah, [[H4320]] Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Asaiah [[H6222]] the servant [[H5650]] of the king: [[H4428]] 
13 “Go [[H1980]] and inquire [[H1875]] of the LORD [[H3068]] for me, [[H1157]] for [[H1157]] the people, [[H5971]] and for [[H1157]] all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] concerning [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] in this [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] that has been found. [[H4672]] For [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] [is] the wrath [[H2534]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] burns [[H3341]] against us  because [[H834]] our fathers [[H1]] have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] by doing [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] about us. [[H5921]] 
14 So Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest, [[H3548]] Ahikam, [[H296]] Achbor, [[H5907]] Shaphan, [[H8227]] and Asaiah [[H6222]] went [[H1980]] and spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Huldah [[H2468]] the prophetess, [[H5031]] the wife [[H802]] of Shallum [[H7967]] son [[H1121]] of Tikvah, [[H8616]] the son [[H1121]] of Harhas, [[H2745]] the keeper [[H8104]] of the wardrobe. [[H899]] She [[H1931]] lived [[H3427]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] in the Second District. [[H4932]] 
15 And [Huldah] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Tell [[H559]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] sent [[H7971]] you [[H853]] 
16 that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] I am about to bring [[H935]] calamity [[H7451]] on [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and on [[H5921]] its people, [[H3427]] according to all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the book [[H5612]] that [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] has read, [[H7121]] 
17 because [[H8478]] they have forsaken Me [[H5800]] and burned incense [[H6999]] to other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] that [[H4616]] they might provoke Me to anger [[H3707]] with all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] of their hands. [[H3027]] My wrath [[H2534]] will be kindled [[H3341]] against this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and will not [[H3808]] be quenched.’ [[H3518]] 
18 But as for [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] who sent [[H7971]] you [[H853]] to inquire [[H1875]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] tell him [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘As for the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] you heard, [[H8085]] 
19 because [[H3282]] your heart [[H3824]] was tender [[H7401]] and you humbled yourself [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] when you heard [[H8085]] what [[H834]] I spoke [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and against [[H5921]] its people, [[H3427]] that they would become [[H1961]] a desolation [[H8047]] and a curse, [[H7045]] and because you have torn [[H7167]] your clothes [[H899]] and wept [[H1058]] before Me, [[H6440]] I [[H595]] have heard [you], [[H8085]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
20 ‘Therefore [[H3651]] I will indeed gather [[H622]] you to [[H5921]] your fathers, [[H1]] and you will be gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] your grave [[H6913]] in peace. [[H7965]] Your eyes [[H5869]] will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the calamity [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] will bring [[H935]] on [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place.’” [[H4725]] So they brought [[H7725]] her answer [[H1697]] back to the king. [[H4428]]
