[[2 Kings 2|←]] • [[2 Kings 4|→]]
1 In the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoshaphat's [[H3092]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Jehoram [[H3088]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Samaria [[H8111]] twelve [[H8147]] years. [[H8141]] 
2 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] but [[H7535]] not [[H3808]] as his father [[H1]] and mother [had done]. [[H517]] For he removed [[H5493]] the sacred pillar [[H4676]] of Baal [[H1168]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] had made. [[H6213]] 
3 Nevertheless, [[H7535]] he clung [[H1692]] to the sins [[H2403]] that [[H834]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit; [[H2398]] he did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from them. [[H4480]] 
4 Now Mesha [[H4338]] king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] was [[H1961]] a sheep breeder, [[H5349]] and he would render [[H7725]] to the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] a hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] lambs [[H3733]] and the wool [[H6785]] of a hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] rams. [[H352]] 
5 But after [[H1961]] the death [[H4194]] of Ahab, [[H256]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] rebelled [[H6586]] against the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
6 So at that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] King [[H4428]] Jehoram [[H3088]] set out [[H3318]] from Samaria [[H8111]] and mobilized [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
7 And he sent [[H7971]] a message to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] of Judah: [[H3063]] “The king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] has rebelled [[H6586]] against me.  Will you go [[H1980]] with me [[H854]] to fight [[H4421]] against [[H413]] Moab?” [[H4124]] “I will go,” [[H5927]] replied Jehoshaphat. [[H559]] “I [am] [[H3644]] as you [are], [[H3644]] my people [[H5971]] as your people, [[H5971]] my horses [[H5483]] as your horses.” [[H5483]] 
8 Then he asked, [[H559]] “Which [[H335]] way [[H1870]] shall we go up?” [[H5927]] “By way [[H1870]] of the Desert [[H4057]] of Edom,” [[H123]] replied Joram. [[H559]] 
9 So the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the king [[H4428]] of Edom [[H123]] set out, [[H1980]] and after they had traveled a roundabout [[H5437]] route [[H1870]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] they had no [[H3808]] water [[H4325]] for their army [[H4264]] or for their [[H834]] animals. [[H929]] 
10 “Alas,” [[H162]] said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] has summoned [[H7121]] these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] kings [[H4428]] to deliver [[H5414]] them [[H853]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Moab!” [[H4124]] 
11 But Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] asked, [[H559]] “Is there no [[H369]] prophet [[H5030]] of the LORD [[H3068]] here? [[H6311]] Let us inquire [[H1875]] of the LORD [[H3068]] through him.” [[H854]] And one [[H259]] of the servants [[H5650]] of the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] answered, [[H6030]] “Elisha [[H477]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphat [[H8202]] is here. [[H6311]] [He] [[H834]] used to pour [[H3332]] water [[H4325]] on [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of Elijah.” [[H452]] 
12 Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] affirmed, [[H559]] “The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is [[H3426]] with him.” [[H854]] So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] and the king [[H4428]] of Edom [[H123]] went down [[H3381]] to him. [[H413]] 
13 Elisha, however, [[H477]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “What have we to do [[H4100]] with [each other]?  Go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the prophets [[H5030]] of your father [[H1]] and [[H413]] of your mother!” [[H517]] “No,” [[H408]] replied [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “for [[H3588]] it is the LORD [[H3068]] who has summoned [[H7121]] these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] kings [[H4428]] to deliver [[H5414]] them [[H853]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Moab.” [[H4124]] 
14 Then Elisha [[H477]] said, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] lives, [[H2416]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] I stand, [[H5975]] were it not [[H3884]] for my regard [[H5375]] for the presence [[H6440]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] I would not [[H518]] look [[H5027]] at you [[H413]] or [[H518]] acknowledge you. [[H7200]] 
15 But now, [[H6258]] bring [[H3947]] me  a harpist.” [[H5059]] And while the harpist [[H5059]] played, [[H5059]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon Elisha [[H5921]] 
16 and he said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Dig [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] valley [[H5158]] full of ditches.’ [[H1356]] 
17 For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] says, [[H559]] ‘You will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] wind [[H7307]] or rain, [[H1653]] but the [[H1931]] valley [[H5158]] will be filled [[H4390]] with water, [[H4325]] and you will drink— [[H8354]] you [[H859]] and your cattle [[H4735]] and your animals.’ [[H929]] 
18 This [[H2063]] is a simple matter [[H7043]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and He will also deliver [[H5414]] the Moabites [[H4124]] into your hand. [[H3027]] 
19 And you shall attack [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] fortified [[H4013]] city [[H5892]] and every [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] of importance. [[H4004]] You shall cut down [[H5307]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] tree, [[H6086]] stop up [[H5640]] every [[H3605]] spring, [[H4599]] and ruin [[H3510]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] field [[H2513]] with stones.” [[H68]] 
20 The next morning, [[H1242]] at the time of the morning sacrifice, [[H5927]] water [[H4325]] suddenly [[H2009]] flowed [[H935]] from the direction [[H1870]] of Edom [[H123]] and filled [[H4390]] the land. [[H776]] 
21 Now all [[H3605]] the Moabites [[H4124]] had heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the kings [[H4428]] had come up [[H5927]] to fight against them. [[H3898]] So all [[H3605]] who could bear arms, [[H2296]] [young] and old, [[H4605]] were summoned [[H6817]] and stationed [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] the border. [[H1366]] 
22 When they got up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] the sun [[H8121]] was shining [[H2224]] on [[H5921]] the water, [[H4325]] and [it] [[H4325]] looked [[H7200]] [as] red [[H122]] as blood [[H1818]] to the Moabites [[H4124]] across the way. [[H5048]] 
23 “This [[H2088]] is blood!” [[H1818]] they exclaimed. [[H559]] “The kings [[H4428]] have clashed swords [[H2717]] and slaughtered [[H5221]] each [[H376]] other. [[H7453]] Now [[H6258]] to the plunder, [[H7998]] Moab!” [[H4124]] 
24 But when the Moabites came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the Israelites [[H3478]] rose up [[H6965]] and attacked [[H5221]] them, [[H4124]] and they fled [[H5127]] before them. [[H6440]] So [the Israelites] invaded [their] land [[H935]] and struck down [[H5221]] the Moabites. [[H4124]] 
25 They destroyed [[H2040]] the cities, [[H5892]] and each man [[H376]] threw [[H7993]] stones [[H68]] on every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] field [[H2513]] until it was covered. [[H4390]] They stopped up [[H5640]] every [[H3605]] spring [[H4599]] and cut down [[H5307]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] tree. [[H6086]] Only [[H5704]] Kir-haraseth [[H7025]] was left [[H7604]] with stones in place, [[H68]] but men with slings [[H7051]] surrounded it [[H5437]] and attacked it [as well]. [[H5221]] 
26 When the king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the battle [[H4421]] was too fierce [[H2388]] for him, [[H4480]] he took [[H3947]] with him [[H854]] seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] swordsmen [[H376]] to break through [[H1234]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Edom, [[H123]] but they could not prevail. [[H3201]] 
27 So he took [[H3947]] his firstborn [[H1060]] son, [[H1121]] who [[H834]] was to succeed him, [[H4427]] and offered [[H5927]] him as a burnt offering [[H5930]] on [[H5921]] the city wall. [[H2346]] And there was [[H1961]] great [[H1419]] fury [[H7110]] against [[H5921]] the Israelites, [[H3478]] so they withdrew [[H5265]] and returned [[H7725]] to [their own] land. [[H776]]
