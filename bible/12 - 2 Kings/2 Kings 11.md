1 When Athaliah [[H6271]] the mother [[H517]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] her son [[H1121]] was dead, [[H4191]] she proceeded [[H6965]] to annihilate [[H6]] all [[H3605]] the royal [[H4467]] heirs. [[H2233]] 
2 But Jehosheba [[H3089]] daughter [[H1323]] of King [[H4428]] Joram, [[H3141]] the sister [[H269]] of Ahaziah, [[H274]] took [[H3947]] Joash [[H3101]] son [[H1121]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] and stole him away [[H1589]] from among [[H8432]] the sons [[H1121]] of the king [[H4428]] [who were] being murdered. [[H4191]] [She put] him and his nurse [[H3243]] in a bedroom [[H2315]] to hide [[H5641]] him [[H853]] from [[H6440]] Athaliah, [[H6271]] and he was not [[H3808]] killed. [[H4191]] 
3 And [Joash] remained [[H1961]] hidden [[H2244]] with [his nurse] [[H854]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] for six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] while Athaliah [[H6271]] ruled [[H4427]] the land. [[H776]] 
4 Then in the seventh [[H7637]] year, [[H8141]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] sent for [[H7971]] the captains [[H8269]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] the Carites, [[H3746]] and the guards, [[H7323]] and had them brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] [There] [[H1004]] he made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with them [[H1992]] and put them under oath. [[H7650]] He showed [[H7200]] them [[H853]] the king's [[H4428]] son [[H1121]] 
5 and commanded them, [[H6680]] “This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] you are to do: [[H6213]] A third [[H7992]] of you [[H4480]] who come on duty [[H935]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] shall guard [[H8104]] the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] 
6 a third [shall be] [[H7992]] at the gate [[H8179]] of Sur, [[H5495]] and a third [[H7992]] at the gate [[H8179]] behind [[H310]] the guards. [[H7323]] You are to take turns [[H4535]] guarding [[H8104]] the temple— [[H1004]] 
7 the two [[H8147]] divisions [[H3027]] that would go off duty [[H3318]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] are to guard [[H8104]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] for [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]] 
8 You must surround [[H5362]] the king [[H4428]] with weapons [[H3627]] in hand, [[H3027]] and anyone [[H376]] who approaches [[H935]] the ranks [[H7713]] must be put to death. [[H4191]] You must stay [[H1961]] close [[H854]] to the king [[H4428]] wherever he goes.” [[H3318]] 
9 So the commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] had ordered. [[H6680]] Each of them [[H376]] took [[H3947]] his men— [[H376]] those coming on duty [[H935]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] and [[H5973]] those going off duty— [[H3318]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest. [[H3548]] 
10 Then the priest [[H3548]] gave [[H5414]] to the commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] the spears [[H2595]] and [[H853]] shields [[H7982]] of King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] from [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
11 And the guards [[H7323]] stood [[H5975]] with weapons [[H3627]] in hand [[H3027]] surrounding [[H5439]] the king [[H4428]] by the altar [[H4196]] and the temple, [[H1004]] from the south [[H3233]] side [[H3802]] to [[H5704]] the north [[H8042]] side [[H3802]] of the temple. [[H1004]] 
12 Then [Jehoiada] brought out [[H3318]] the king’s [[H4428]] son, [[H1121]] put [[H5414]] the crown [[H5145]] on him, [[H5921]] presented him with the Testimony, [[H5715]] and proclaimed him king. [[H4427]] They anointed him, [[H4886]] and [the people] clapped [[H5221]] their hands [[H3709]] and declared, [[H559]] “Long live [[H2421]] the king!” [[H4428]] 
13 When Athaliah [[H6271]] heard [[H8085]] the noise [[H6963]] from the guards [[H7323]] [and] the people, [[H5971]] she went out [[H935]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
14 And she looked out [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] the king, [[H4428]] standing [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the pillar, [[H5982]] according to the custom. [[H4941]] The officers [[H8269]] and trumpeters [[H2689]] were beside [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] were rejoicing [[H8056]] and blowing [[H8628]] trumpets. [[H2689]] Then Athaliah [[H6271]] tore [[H7167]] her clothes [[H899]] and screamed, [[H7121]] Treason! [[H7195]] Treason! [[H7195]] 
15 And Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] ordered [[H6680]] the commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] in charge of [[H6485]] the army, [[H2428]] “Bring her out [[H3318]] between the ranks, [[H7713]] and put to [[H4191]] the sword [[H2719]] anyone who follows [[H935]] her.” [[H310]] For [[H3588]] the priest [[H3548]] had said, [[H559]] “She must not [[H408]] be put to death [[H4191]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] 
16 So they seized [[H7760]] [Athaliah] [[H3027]] as she reached [[H935]] the horses' [[H5483]] entrance [[H3996]] to the palace grounds, [[H4428]] and there [[H8033]] she was put to death. [[H4191]] 
17 Then Jehoiada [[H3077]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] between [[H996]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the king, [[H4428]] and the people [[H5971]] that they would be [[H1961]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] people. [[H5971]] He also made a covenant between [[H996]] the king [[H4428]] and [[H996]] the people. [[H5971]] 
18 So all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] went [[H935]] to the temple [[H1004]] of Baal [[H1168]] and tore it down. [[H5422]] They smashed the altars [[H4196]] and idols [[H6754]] into pieces, [[H7665]] and they killed [[H2026]] Mattan [[H4977]] the priest [[H3548]] of Baal [[H1168]] in front of [[H6440]] the altars. [[H4196]] And Jehoiada the priest [[H3548]] posted [[H7760]] guards [[H6486]] for [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
19 He took with him [[H3947]] the commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] the Carites, [[H3746]] the guards, [[H7323]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] and they brought [[H3381]] the king {down} [[H4428]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and entered [[H935]] the royal [[H4428]] palace [[H1004]] by way [[H1870]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the guards. [[H7323]] Then [Joash] took his seat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the royal [[H4428]] throne, [[H3678]] 
20 and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] rejoiced. [[H8055]] And the city [[H5892]] was quiet, [[H8252]] because Athaliah [[H6271]] had been put to [[H4191]] the sword [[H2719]] at the royal [[H4428]] palace. [[H1004]] 
21 Joash [[H3060]] [was] seven [[H7651]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king. [[H4427]]
