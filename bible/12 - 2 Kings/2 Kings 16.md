[[2 Kings 15|←]] • [[2 Kings 17|→]]
1 In the seventeenth [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] [of the reign] of Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah, [[H7425]] Ahaz [[H271]] son [[H1121]] of Jotham [[H3147]] became king [[H4427]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
2 Ahaz [[H271]] was twenty [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] sixteen [[H8337]] years. [[H8141]] And unlike David [[H1732]] his forefather, [[H1]] he did not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God. [[H430]] 
3 Instead, he walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and even [[H1571]] sacrificed [[H5674]] his son [[H1121]] in the fire, [[H784]] according to the abominations [[H8441]] of the nations [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had driven out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
4 And he sacrificed [[H2076]] and burned incense [[H6999]] on the high places, [[H1116]] on [[H5921]] the hills, [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree. [[H6086]] 
5 Then [[H227]] Rezin [[H7526]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] and Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah [[H7425]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] came up [[H5927]] to wage war [[H4421]] against Jerusalem. [[H3389]] They besieged [[H6696]] Ahaz [[H271]] but could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] overcome [him]. [[H3898]] 
6 At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Rezin [[H7526]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] recovered [[H7725]] Elath [[H359]] for Aram, [[H758]] drove out [[H5394]] the men of Judah, [[H3064]] and sent [[H935]] the Edomites [[H726]] into Elath, [[H359]] where [[H8033]] they live [[H3427]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
7 So Ahaz [[H271]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Tiglath-pileser [[H8407]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] saying, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] am your servant [[H5650]] and your son. [[H1121]] Come up [[H5927]] and save me [[H3467]] from the hands [[H3709]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] [and] [[H4428]] Israel, [[H3478]] who are rising up [[H6965]] against me.” [[H5921]] 
8 Ahaz [[H271]] also took [[H3947]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3069]] and in the treasuries [[H214]] of the king’s [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and he sent it [[H7971]] as a gift [[H7810]] to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] 
9 So the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] listened [[H8085]] to him, [[H413]] marched up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Damascus, [[H1834]] and captured it. [[H8610]] He took its people [[H1540]] to Kir as captives [[H7024]] and [[H853]] put Rezin [[H7526]] to death. [[H4191]] 
10 Then King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] went [[H1980]] to Damascus [[H1834]] to meet [[H7125]] Tiglath-pileser [[H8407]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] On seeing [[H7200]] the altar [[H4196]] in Damascus, [[H1834]] King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] sent [[H7971]] Uriah [[H223]] the priest [[H3548]] a model [[H1823]] of the altar [[H4196]] and complete plans [[H8403]] for its construction. [[H4639]] 
11 And Uriah [[H223]] built [[H1129]] the altar [[H4196]] according to all [[H3605]] the instructions [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] had sent [[H7971]] from Damascus, [[H1834]] [and] [[H3651]] he completed it [[H6213]] by the time [[H5704]] King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] had returned. [[H935]] 
12 When the king [[H4428]] came back [[H935]] from Damascus [[H1834]] and saw [[H7200]] the altar, [[H4196]] he [[H4428]] approached [[H7126]] [it] [[H4196]] and presented offerings [[H5927]] on it. [[H5921]] 
13 He offered [[H6999]] his burnt offering [[H5930]] and his grain offering, [[H4503]] poured out [[H5258]] his drink offering, [[H5262]] and sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] of his peace offerings [[H8002]] on [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] 
14 He also took [[H7126]] the bronze [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] that [[H834]] stood before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] from the front [[H6440]] of the temple [[H1004]] (between [[H996]] the [new] altar [[H4196]] and [[H996]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD) [[H3068]] and he put [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] the north [[H6828]] side [[H3409]] of the [new] altar. [[H4196]] 
15 Then King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] commanded [[H6680]] Uriah [[H223]] the priest, [[H3548]] “Offer [[H6999]] on [[H5921]] the great [[H1419]] altar [[H4196]] the morning [[H1242]] burnt offering, [[H5930]] the evening [[H6153]] grain offering, [[H4503]] and the king’s [[H4428]] burnt offering [[H5930]] and grain offering, [[H4503]] as well as the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] grain offerings, [[H4503]] and drink offerings [[H5262]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]] Sprinkle [[H2236]] on the altar [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the blood [[H1818]] of the burnt offerings [[H5930]] [and] [[H3605]] sacrifices. [[H2077]] But I will use [[H1961]] the bronze [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] to seek guidance. [[H1239]] 
16 So Uriah [[H223]] the priest [[H3548]] did [[H6213]] just as [[H3605]] King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] had commanded. [[H6680]] 
17 King [[H4428]] Ahaz also [[H271]] cut off [[H7112]] the frames [[H4526]] of the movable stands [[H4350]] and removed [[H5493]] the bronze basin [[H853]] from each of them. [[H5921]] He took down [[H3381]] the Sea [[H3220]] from [[H5921]] the bronze [[H5178]] bulls [[H1241]] that [[H834]] were under it  and put [[H5414]] it [[H853]] on [[H5921]] a stone [[H68]] base. [[H4837]] 
18 And [[H853]] on account [[H6440]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] he removed [[H5437]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] canopy [[H4329]] they had built [[H1129]] in the temple [[H1004]] and closed the royal [[H4428]] entryway [[H3996]] outside [[H2435]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
19 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Ahaz, [[H271]] along with his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] 
20 And Ahaz [[H271]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] [them] [[H1]] in the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] and his son [[H1121]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
