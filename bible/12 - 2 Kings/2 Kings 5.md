1 Now Naaman, [[H5283]] the commander [[H8269]] of the army [[H6635]] of the king [[H4428]] of Aram, [[H758]] was [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] man [[H376]] in his master’s [[H113]] sight [[H6440]] and highly regarded; [[H5375]] for [[H3588]] through him  the LORD [[H3068]] had given [[H5414]] victory [[H8668]] to Aram. [[H758]] And he was [[H1961]] a mighty warrior, [[H1368]] [but he was] a leper. [[H6879]] 
2 At this time the Arameans [[H758]] had gone [[H3318]] out in bands [[H1416]] and had taken [[H7617]] a young [[H6996]] girl [[H5291]] from the land [[H776]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and she was serving [[H1961]] Naaman’s [[H5283]] wife. [[H802]] 
3 She said [[H559]] to [[H413]] her mistress, [[H1404]] “If only [[H305]] my master [[H113]] would go to the prophet [[H5030]] who [[H834]] is in Samaria, [[H8111]] he would cure [[H622]] him [[H853]] of his leprosy.” [[H6883]] 
4 And Naaman went [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] his master [[H113]] what [[H2063]] the girl [[H5291]] from the land [[H776]] of Israel [[H3478]] had said. [[H1696]] 
5 “Go now,” [[H1980]] said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] of Aram, [[H758]] “and I will send you with [[H7971]] a letter [[H5612]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel.” [[H3478]] So [Naaman] departed, [[H1980]] taking [[H3947]] with him [[H3027]] ten [[H6235]] talents [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] six [[H8337]] thousand [shekels] [[H505]] of gold, [[H2091]] and ten [[H6235]] sets [[H2487]] of clothing. [[H899]] 
6 And the letter [[H5612]] that he took [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] stated: [[H559]] “With [[H6258]] this [[H2088]] letter [[H5612]] I have sent [[H7971]] my servant [[H5650]] Naaman, [[H5283]] so that you may cure him [[H622]] of his leprosy.” [[H6883]] 
7 When the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] read [[H7121]] the letter, [[H5612]] he tore [[H7167]] his clothes [[H899]] and asked, [[H559]] “Am I [[H589]] God, [[H430]] killing [[H4191]] and giving life, [[H2421]] that [[H3588]] this [man] [[H2088]] expects [[H7971]] me [[H413]] to cure [[H622]] a leper? [[H6883]] Surely you can [[H3045]] see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is seeking a quarrel [[H579]] with me!  
8 Now [[H1961]] when Elisha [[H477]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] had torn [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] he sent [[H7971]] a message to [[H413]] the king: [[H4428]] “Why [[H4100]] have you torn [[H7167]] your clothes? [[H899]] Please [[H4994]] let [the man] come [[H935]] to me, [[H413]] and he will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] a prophet [[H5030]] in Israel. [[H3478]] 
9 So Naaman [[H5283]] came [[H935]] with his horses [[H5483]] and chariots [[H7393]] and stood [[H5975]] at the door [[H6607]] of Elisha’s [[H477]] house. [[H1004]] 
10 Then Elisha [[H477]] sent [[H7971]] him [[H413]] a messenger, [[H4397]] who said, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] and wash yourself [[H7364]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] in the Jordan, [[H3383]] and your flesh [[H1320]] will be restored, [[H7725]] and you will be clean.” [[H2891]] 
11 But Naaman [[H5283]] went away [[H1980]] angry, [[H7107]] saying, [[H559]] “I thought that [[H559]] he would surely come out, [[H3318]] stand [[H5975]] and call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] and wave [[H5130]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H413]] the spot [[H4725]] to cure [[H622]] my leprosy. [[H6879]] 
12 [Are] not [[H3808]] Abanah [[H71]] and Pharpar, [[H6554]] the rivers [[H5104]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] better [[H2896]] than all [[H3605]] the waters [[H4325]] of Israel? [[H3478]] Could I not [[H3808]] have washed [[H7364]] in them  and been cleansed?” [[H2891]] So he turned [[H6437]] and went away [[H1980]] in a rage. [[H2534]] 
13 Naaman's servants, however, [[H5650]] approached him [[H5066]] and said, [[H1696]] “My father, [[H1]] if the prophet [[H5030]] had told [[H1696]] you [[H413]] to do some great [[H1419]] thing, [[H1697]] would you not [[H3808]] have done [it]? [[H6213]] How much more, then, [[H637]] when [[H3588]] he tells [[H559]] you, [[H413]] ‘Wash [[H7364]] and be cleansed’?” [[H2891]] 
14 So Naaman went down [[H3381]] and dipped himself [[H2881]] in the Jordan [[H3383]] seven [[H7651]] times, [[H6471]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and his flesh [[H1320]] was restored [[H7725]] and became like [that] [[H1320]] of a little [[H6996]] child, [[H5288]] and he was clean. [[H2891]] 
15 Then Naaman [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] his attendants [[H4264]] went back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] stood [[H5975]] before him, [[H6440]] and declared, [[H559]] “Now [[H4994]] I know [[H3045]] for sure [[H2009]] that there is no [[H369]] God [[H430]] in all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] except [[H3588]] in Israel. [[H3478]] So [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] accept [[H3947]] a gift [[H1293]] from [[H853]] your servant. [[H5650]] 
16 But Elisha replied, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] before whom [[H6440]] I stand, [[H5975]] I will not [[H518]] accept it.” [[H3947]] And although Naaman urged [[H6484]] him  to accept it, [[H3947]] he refused. [[H3985]] 
17 “If you will not,” [[H3808]] said [[H559]] Naaman, [[H5283]] “please [[H4994]] let me, your servant, [[H5650]] be given [[H5414]] as much soil [[H127]] as a pair [[H6776]] of mules [[H6505]] can carry. [[H4853]] For [[H3588]] your servant [[H5650]] will never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] make [[H6213]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] or a sacrifice [[H2077]] to any other [[H312]] god [[H430]] but [[H3588]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
18 Yet may the LORD [[H3068]] forgive [[H5545]] your servant [[H5650]] this [[H2088]] one thing: [[H1697]] When my master [[H113]] goes into [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] of Rimmon [[H7417]] to worship [[H7812]] there, [[H8033]] and he [[H1931]] leans [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] my arm, [[H3027]] and I bow down [[H7812]] in the temple [[H1004]] of Rimmon, [[H7417]] may the LORD [[H3068]] forgive [[H5545]] your servant [[H5650]] in this [[H2088]] matter. [[H1697]] 
19 “Go [[H1980]] in peace,” [[H7965]] said [Elisha], [[H559]] and [Naaman] departed. [[H1980]] But after he had traveled a short distance, [[H776]] 
20 Gehazi, [[H1522]] the servant [[H5288]] of Elisha [[H477]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Look, [[H2009]] my master [[H113]] has spared [[H2820]] this [[H2088]] Aramean, [[H761]] Naaman, [[H5283]] while not accepting [[H3947]] what [[H834]] he brought. [[H935]] As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] I will run [[H7323]] after him [[H310]] and get [[H3947]] something [[H3972]] from him. [[H853]] 
21 So Gehazi [[H1522]] pursued [[H7291]] Naaman. [[H5283]] And when Naaman [[H5283]] saw [him] [[H7200]] running [[H7323]] toward him, [[H310]] he got down [[H5307]] from [[H5921]] the chariot [[H4818]] to meet him [[H7125]] and asked, [[H559]] “Is everything all right?” [[H7965]] 
22 “Everything [is] all right,” [[H7965]] Gehazi replied. [[H559]] “My master [[H113]] has sent [[H7971]] me to say, [[H559]] ‘I have just now [[H6258]] discovered [[H2009]] that two [[H8147]] young men [[H5288]] from the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] have come [[H935]] to me [[H413]] from the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim. [[H669]] Please [[H4994]] give [[H5414]] them  a talent [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] and two [[H8147]] sets [[H2487]] of clothing.” [[H899]] 
23 But Naaman [[H5283]] insisted, [[H559]] “Please, [[H2974]] take [[H3947]] two talents.” [[H3603]] And he urged [[H6555]] Gehazi {to accept them}.  Then he tied up [[H6887]] two talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] in two [[H8147]] bags [[H2754]] along with two [[H8147]] sets [[H2487]] of clothing [[H899]] and gave [[H5414]] them to [[H413]] two [[H8147]] of his servants, [[H5288]] who carried them [[H5375]] ahead of Gehazi. [[H6440]] 
24 When Gehazi came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the hill, [[H6076]] he took [[H3947]] the gifts from [the servants] [[H3027]] and stored them [[H6485]] in the house. [[H1004]] Then he dismissed [[H7971]] the men, [[H582]] and they departed. [[H1980]] 
25 When Gehazi [[H1931]] went in [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H413]] his master, [[H113]] Elisha [[H477]] asked [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “Gehazi, [[H1522]] where [have you been]?” [[H575]] “Your servant [[H5650]] did not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] anywhere,” [[H575]] he replied. [[H559]] 
26 But Elisha questioned him, [[H559]] “Did not [[H3808]] my spirit [[H3820]] go [with you] [[H1980]] when [[H834]] the man [[H376]] got down [[H2015]] from [[H5921]] his chariot [[H4818]] to meet you? [[H7125]] Is this the time [[H6256]] to accept [[H3947]] money [[H3701]] and clothing, [[H899]] olive groves [[H2132]] and vineyards, [[H3754]] sheep [[H6629]] and oxen, [[H1241]] menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants? [[H8198]] 
27 Therefore, the leprosy [[H6883]] of Naaman [[H5283]] will cling [[H1692]] to you  and your descendants [[H2233]] forever!” [[H5769]] And as Gehazi left [[H3318]] his presence, [[H6440]] [he was] leprous— [[H6879]] [as white] as snow. [[H7950]]
