[[2 Kings 24|←]] • [[1 Chronicles 1|→]]
1 So [[H1961]] in the ninth [[H8671]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah’s reign, [[H4427]] on the tenth [[H6218]] day of the tenth [[H6224]] month, [[H2320]] King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] of Babylon [[H894]] marched [[H935]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with his entire [[H3605]] army. [[H2428]] They encamped [[H2583]] outside [the city] [[H5921]] and built [[H1129]] a siege wall [[H1785]] all around it. [[H5439]] 
2 And the city [[H5892]] was kept [[H935]] under siege [[H4692]] until [[H5704]] King [[H4428]] Zedekiah’s [[H6667]] eleventh [[H6249]] year. [[H8141]] 
3 By the ninth [day] [[H8672]] of the [fourth] month, [[H2320]] the famine [[H7458]] in the city [[H5892]] was so severe [[H2388]] that the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] food. [[H3899]] 
4 Then the city [[H5892]] was breached; [[H1234]] and though the Chaldeans [[H3778]] had surrounded [[H5439]] the city, [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] fled by night [[H3915]] by way [[H1870]] of the gate [[H8179]] between [[H996]] the two walls [[H2346]] near [[H5921]] the king’s [[H4428]] garden. [[H1588]] They fled [[H1980]] toward [[H1870]] the Arabah, [[H6160]] 
5 but the army [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] pursued [[H7291]] [the king] [[H4428]] and overtook [[H5381]] him [[H853]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Jericho, [[H3405]] and all [[H3605]] his army [[H2428]] was separated [[H6327]] from him. [[H5921]] 
6 The Chaldeans seized [[H8610]] the king [[H4428]] and brought him up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] at Riblah, [[H7247]] where they pronounced [[H1696]] judgment [[H4941]] on him. [[H854]] 
7 And [[H853]] they slaughtered [[H7819]] the sons [[H1121]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] before his eyes. [[H5869]] Then [[H853]] they put out [[H5786]] [his] [[H6667]] eyes, [[H5869]] bound him [[H631]] in bronze shackles, [[H5178]] and took [[H935]] him to Babylon. [[H894]] 
8 On the seventh [[H7651]] day of the fifth [[H2549]] month, [[H2320]] in the nineteenth [[H8672]] year [[H8141]] of Nebuchadnezzar's [[H5019]] reign [[H4428]] over Babylon, [[H894]] Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard, [[H2876]] a servant [[H5650]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] entered [[H935]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
9 He burned down [[H8313]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] the houses [[H1004]] of Jerusalem— [[H3389]] every [[H3605]] significant [[H1419]] building. [[H1004]] 
10 And the whole [[H3605]] army [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] under [[H834]] the commander [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] broke down [[H5422]] the walls [[H2346]] around [[H5439]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
11 Then Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] carried into exile [[H1540]] the people [[H5971]] who remained [[H7604]] in the city, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] the deserters [[H5307]] who [[H834]] had defected [[H5307]] to [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and the rest [[H3499]] of the population. [[H1995]] 
12 But the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] left behind [[H7604]] some of the poorest [[H1803]] of the land [[H776]] to tend the vineyards [[H3755]] and fields. [[H1461]] 
13 Moreover, [[H853]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] broke up [[H7665]] the bronze [[H5178]] pillars [[H5982]] and [[H853]] the stands [[H4350]] and the bronze [[H5178]] sea [[H3220]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and they carried [[H5375]] the bronze [[H5178]] to Babylon. [[H894]] 
14 They also took away [[H3947]] the pots, [[H5518]] shovels, [[H3257]] wick trimmers, [[H4212]] dishes, [[H3709]] and all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] of bronze [[H5178]] used in temple service. [[H8334]] 
15 The captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] also took away [[H3947]] the censers [[H4289]] and sprinkling bowls— [[H4219]] anything [made of] [[H834]] pure gold [[H2091]] or fine silver. [[H3701]] 
16 As for the two [[H8147]] pillars, [[H5982]] the [[H259]] Sea, [[H3220]] and the movable stands [[H4350]] that [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made [[H6213]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] {the weight} of the bronze [[H5178]] from all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] articles [[H3627]] [was beyond] measure. [[H4948]] 
17 Each [[H259]] pillar [[H5982]] was eighteen [[H8083]] cubits [[H520]] tall. [[H6967]] The bronze [[H5178]] capital [[H3805]] atop [one pillar] [[H5921]] was three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H6967]] with a network [[H7639]] of bronze [[H5178]] pomegranates [[H7416]] all [[H3605]] around. [[H5439]] The second [[H8145]] pillar, [[H5982]] with its network, [[H7639]] was similar. [[H428]] 
18 The captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] also took away [[H3947]] Seraiah [[H8304]] the chief [[H7218]] priest, [[H3548]] Zephaniah [[H6846]] the priest [[H3548]] of the second rank, [[H4932]] and the three [[H7969]] doorkeepers. [[H8104]] 
19 Of those [[H4480]] still in the city, [[H5892]] he took [[H3947]] a [[H259]] court official [[H5631]] who [[H834]] had been appointed [[H6496]] over [[H5921]] the men [[H582]] of war [[H4421]] and five [[H2568]] royal [[H4428]] advisors, [[H7200]] as well as [[H853]] the scribe [[H5608]] of the captain [[H8269]] of the army, [[H6635]] who enlisted [[H6633]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] and sixty [[H8346]] men [[H376]] [who were] found [[H4672]] in the city. [[H5892]] 
20 Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] took [[H3947]] them [[H853]] and brought [[H1980]] them [[H853]] to [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] at Riblah. [[H7247]] 
21 There at Riblah [[H7247]] in the land [[H776]] of Hamath, [[H2574]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] struck [[H5221]] them {down} [[H853]] and put them to death. [[H4191]] So Judah [[H3063]] was taken into exile, [[H1540]] away from [[H5921]] her land. [[H127]] 
22 Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] appointed [[H6485]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] over [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] he had left behind [[H7604]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
23 When all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the armies [[H2428]] and their men [[H376]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had appointed [[H6485]] Gedaliah {as governor}, [[H1436]] they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] at Mizpah— [[H4709]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] Seraiah [[H8304]] son [[H1121]] of Tanhumeth [[H8576]] the Netophathite, [[H5200]] and Jaazaniah [[H2970]] son [[H1121]] of the Maacathite, [[H4602]] as well as their men. [[H376]] 
24 And Gedaliah [[H1436]] took an oath [[H7650]] before them  and their men, [[H376]] assuring [[H559]] them,  “Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of the servants [[H5650]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] Live [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] and serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and it will be well [[H3190]] with you.”  
25 In the seventh [[H7637]] month, however, [[H2320]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] the son [[H1121]] of Elishama, [[H476]] of the royal [[H4410]] family, [[H2233]] came [[H935]] with [[H854]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] and struck down [[H5221]] and killed [[H4191]] Gedaliah, [[H1436]] along with the Judeans [[H3064]] and Chaldeans [[H3778]] who [[H834]] were [[H1961]] with [[H854]] him at Mizpah. [[H4709]] 
26 Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] small [[H6996]] and [[H5704]] great, [[H1419]] together with the commanders [[H8269]] of the army, [[H2428]] arose [[H6965]] and fled [[H935]] to Egypt [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] fear [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] 
27 On the twenty-seventh [[H6242]] day of the twelfth [[H8147]] month [[H2320]] of the thirty-seventh [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of the exile [[H1546]] of Judah’s [[H3063]] King [[H4428]] Jehoiachin, [[H3078]] in the year [[H8141]] Evil-merodach [[H192]] became king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] he released [[H5375]] King [[H4428]] Jehoiachin [[H3078]] of Judah [[H3063]] from [[H1004]] prison. [[H3608]] 
28 And he spoke [[H1696]] kindly [[H2896]] to Jehoiachin [[H854]] and set [[H5414]] his throne [[H3678]] over [[H5921]] the thrones [[H3678]] of the kings [[H4428]] who [[H834]] were with [[H854]] him in Babylon. [[H894]] 
29 So Jehoiachin changed [[H8132]] his prison [[H3608]] clothes, [[H899]] and for the rest [[H3605]] of his life [[H2416]] he dined [[H398]] regularly [[H8548]] before the [king]. [[H6440]] 
30 And the king [[H4428]] provided [Jehoiachin] [[H5414]] a daily [[H3117]] portion [[H1697]] for the rest [[H3605]] of his life. [[H2416]]
