[[2 Kings 20|←]] • [[2 Kings 22|→]]
1 Manasseh [[H4519]] was twelve [[H8147]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] fifty-five [[H2572]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Hephzibah. [[H2657]] 
2 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] by following the abominations [[H8441]] of the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had driven out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
3 For he rebuilt [[H7725]] the high places [[H1116]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] had destroyed, [[H6]] and he raised up [[H6965]] altars [[H4196]] for Baal. [[H1168]] He made [[H6213]] an Asherah pole, [[H842]] as [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Ahab [[H256]] of Israel [[H3478]] had done, [[H6213]] and he worshiped [[H7812]] and served [[H5647]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven. [[H8064]] 
4 [Manasseh] also built [[H1129]] altars [[H4196]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] of which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said, [[H559]] “In Jerusalem [[H3389]] I will put [[H7760]] My Name.” [[H8034]] 
5 In both [[H8147]] courtyards [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] he built [[H1129]] altars [[H4196]] to all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven. [[H8064]] 
6 He sacrificed [[H5674]] his own son [[H1121]] in the fire, [[H784]] practiced sorcery [[H6049]] and divination, [[H5172]] and consulted [[H6213]] mediums [[H178]] and spiritists. [[H3049]] He did [[H6213]] great [[H7235]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] provoking Him to anger. [[H3707]] 
7 Manasseh even took the carved [[H6459]] Asherah pole [[H842]] he had made [[H6213]] and set it up [[H7760]] in the temple, [[H1004]] of which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] and his son [[H1121]] Solomon, [[H8010]] “In this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] I have chosen [[H977]] out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I will establish [[H7760]] My Name [[H8034]] forever. [[H5769]] 
8 I will never [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] cause the feet [[H7272]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] to wander [[H5110]] from [[H4480]] the land [[H127]] I gave [[H5414]] their fathers, [[H1]] if [[H518]] only [[H7535]] they are careful [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] I have commanded them— [[H6680]] the whole [[H3605]] Law [[H8451]] that [[H834]] My servant [[H5650]] Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] them. [[H853]] 
9 But [the people] did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] led them astray, [[H8582]] so that they did [[H6213]] greater evil [[H7451]] than [[H4480]] the nations [[H1471]] the LORD [[H3068]] had destroyed [[H8045]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] 
10 And the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] His servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]] 
11 “Since [[H3282]] Manasseh [[H4519]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] has committed [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] abominations, [[H8441]] acting more wickedly [[H7489]] than the Amorites [[H567]] who [[H834]] preceded him, [[H6440]] and [[H1571]] with his idols [[H1544]] has caused Judah [[H3063]] to sin, [[H2398]] 
12 this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I am bringing [[H935]] [such] calamity [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah [[H3063]] that [the news] [[H834]] will reverberate [[H6750]] in the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] who hear it. [[H8085]] 
13 I will stretch out [[H5186]] over [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] the measuring line [[H6957]] used against Samaria [[H8111]] and the plumb line [[H4949]] used against the house [[H1004]] of Ahab, [[H256]] and I will wipe out [[H4229]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] as [[H834]] one wipes out [[H4229]] a bowl— [[H6747]] wiping [it] [[H4229]] and turning [it] [[H2015]] upside down. [[H6440]] 
14 So I will forsake [[H5203]] the remnant [[H7611]] of My inheritance [[H5159]] and deliver them [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies. [[H341]] And they will become [[H1961]] plunder [[H957]] and spoil [[H4933]] to all [[H3605]] their enemies, [[H341]] 
15 because [[H3282]] they have done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in My sight [[H5869]] and have provoked [[H3707]] Me {to anger} [[H853]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] their fathers [[H1]] came [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day.’” [[H3117]] 
16 Moreover, [[H1571]] Manasseh [[H4519]] shed [[H8210]] so much [[H7235]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] that [[H5704]] he filled [[H4390]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] from end to end, [[H6310]] in addition to [[H905]] the sin [[H2403]] that [[H834]] he had caused Judah [[H3063]] to commit, [[H2398]] doing [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
17 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments [[H834]] and the sin [[H2403]] that [[H834]] he committed, [[H2398]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] 
18 And Manasseh [[H4519]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in his palace [[H1004]] garden, [[H1588]] the garden [[H1588]] of Uzza. [[H5798]] And his son [[H1121]] Amon [[H526]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
19 Amon [[H526]] was twenty-two [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] two [[H8147]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Meshullemeth [[H4922]] daughter [[H1323]] of Haruz; [[H2743]] she was from [[H4480]] Jotbah. [[H3192]] 
20 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Manasseh [[H4519]] had done. [[H6213]] 
21 He walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] of his father, [[H1]] and he served [[H5647]] and worshiped [[H7812]] the idols [[H1544]] his father [[H1]] had served. [[H5647]] 
22 He abandoned [[H5800]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of his fathers, [[H1]] and did not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
23 Then the servants [[H5650]] of Amon [[H526]] conspired [[H7194]] against him [[H5921]] and killed [[H4191]] the king [[H4428]] in his palace. [[H1004]] 
24 But the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] killed [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] who had conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] King [[H4428]] Amon, [[H526]] and they made his son [[H1121]] Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
25 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Amon, [[H526]] along with his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] 
26 And he was buried [[H6912]] in his tomb [[H6900]] in the garden [[H1588]] of Uzza, [[H5798]] and his son [[H1121]] Josiah [[H2977]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
