1 In the twenty-seventh [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of Jeroboam's [[H3379]] reign [[H4428]] over Israel, [[H3478]] Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Amaziah [[H558]] became king [[H4427]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
2 He was [[H1961]] sixteen [[H8337]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] fifty-two [[H2572]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Jecoliah; [[H3203]] she was from Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
3 And he did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] his father [[H1]] Amaziah [[H558]] had done. [[H6213]] 
4 Nevertheless, [[H7535]] the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] taken away; [[H5493]] the people [[H5971]] continued [[H5750]] sacrificing [[H2076]] and burning incense [[H6999]] [there]. [[H1116]] 
5 And the LORD [[H3068]] afflicted [[H5060]] the king [[H4428]] with leprosy [[H6879]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] he died, [[H4194]] so that he lived [[H3427]] in a separate [[H2669]] house [[H1004]] while [his] [[H4428]] son [[H1121]] Jotham [[H3147]] had charge of [[H5921]] the palace [[H1004]] and governed [[H8199]] the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]] 
6 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Azariah, [[H5838]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] 
7 And Azariah [[H5838]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And his son [[H1121]] Jotham [[H3147]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
8 In the thirty-eighth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of Azariah's [[H5838]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1121]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] [and he reigned] in Samaria [[H8111]] six [[H8337]] months. [[H2320]] 
9 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] his fathers [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]] He did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from the sins that [[H2403]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit. [[H2398]] 
10 Then Shallum [[H7967]] son [[H1121]] of Jabesh [[H3003]] conspired [[H7194]] against Zechariah [[H5921]] and struck him down [[H5221]] and killed him [[H4191]] in front of [[H6904]] the people [[H5971]] and became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
11 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Zechariah, [[H2148]] they are indeed [[H2009]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
12 So the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Jehu [[H3058]] was fulfilled: [[H1961]] “Four generations [[H7243]] of your sons [[H1121]] will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel.” [[H3478]] 
13 In the thirty-ninth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of Uzziah's [[H5818]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Shallum [[H7967]] son [[H1121]] of Jabesh [[H3003]] became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Samaria [[H8111]] one full month. [[H3391]] 
14 Then Menahem [[H4505]] son [[H1121]] of Gadi [[H1424]] went up [[H5927]] from Tirzah [[H8656]] to Samaria, [[H8111]] struck down [[H5221]] and killed [[H4191]] Shallum [[H7967]] son [[H1121]] of Jabesh, [[H3003]] and became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
15 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Shallum, [[H7967]] along with the conspiracy [[H7195]] he led, [[H7194]] they are indeed [[H2009]] written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
16 At that time [[H227]] Menahem, [[H4505]] starting from Tirzah, [[H8656]] attacked [[H5221]] Tiphsah [[H8607]] and [[H853]] everyone [[H3605]] in its [[H834]] vicinity, [[H1366]] because [[H3588]] they would not [[H3808]] open [their gates]. [[H6605]] So he attacked [Tiphsah] [[H5221]] and ripped open [[H1234]] all [[H3605]] the pregnant women. [[H2030]] 
17 In the thirty-ninth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Azariah [[H5838]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Menahem [[H4505]] son [[H1121]] of Gadi [[H1424]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] [and he reigned] in Samaria [[H8111]] ten [[H6235]] years. [[H8141]] 
18 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and throughout [[H3605]] his reign [[H3117]] he did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] the sins that [[H2403]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit. [[H2398]] 
19 Then Pul [[H6322]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] invaded [[H935]] the land, [[H776]] and Menahem [[H4505]] gave [[H5414]] Pul [[H6322]] a thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] in order to gain his support [[H1961]] and strengthen [[H2388]] his own grip [[H3027]] on the kingdom. [[H4467]] 
20 Menahem [[H4505]] exacted [[H3318]] this money [[H3701]] from [[H5921]] each [[H3605]] of the wealthy [[H2428]] men [[H1368]] of Israel— [[H3478]] fifty [[H2572]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver [[H3701]] from each [[H259]] man— [[H376]] to give [[H5414]] to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] So the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] withdrew [[H7725]] and did not [[H3808]] remain [[H5975]] in the land. [[H776]] 
21 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Menahem, [[H4505]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]] 
22 And Menahem [[H4505]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and his son [[H1121]] Pekahiah [[H6494]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
23 In the fiftieth [[H2572]] year [[H8141]] of Azariah's [[H5838]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Pekahiah [[H6494]] son [[H1121]] of Menahem [[H4505]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] and reigned in Samaria [[H8111]] two years. [[H8141]] 
24 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from the sins that [[H2403]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit. [[H2398]] 
25 Then his officer, [[H7991]] Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah, [[H7425]] conspired [[H7194]] against him [[H5921]] along with [[H854]] Argob, [[H709]] Arieh, [[H745]] and [[H5973]] fifty [[H2572]] men [[H376]] of [[H1121]] Gilead. [[H1569]] And at the citadel [[H759]] of the king’s [[H4428]] palace [[H1004]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] [Pekah] struck down [[H5221]] and killed [Pekahiah] [[H4191]] and became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
26 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Pekahiah, [[H6494]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] they are indeed [[H2009]] written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
27 In the fifty-second [[H2572]] year [[H8141]] of Azariah's [[H5838]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah [[H7425]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] [and reigned] in Samaria [[H8111]] twenty [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]] 
28 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] the sins that [[H2403]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit. [[H2398]] 
29 In the days [[H3117]] of Pekah [[H6492]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Tiglath-pileser [[H8407]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] came [[H935]] and captured [[H3947]] Ijon, [[H5859]] Abel-beth-maacah, [[H62]] Janoah, [[H3239]] Kedesh, [[H6943]] Hazor, [[H2674]] Gilead, [[H1568]] and Galilee, [[H1551]] including all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] and he took the people [[H1540]] to Assyria {as captives}. [[H804]] 
30 Then Hoshea [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Elah [[H425]] led [[H7194]] a conspiracy [[H7195]] against [[H5921]] Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah. [[H7425]] In the twentieth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] [of the reign] of Jotham [[H3147]] son [[H1121]] of Uzziah, [[H5818]] [Hoshea] attacked [Pekah], [[H5221]] killed him, [[H4191]] and became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
31 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Pekah, [[H6492]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] they are indeed [[H2009]] written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
32 In the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah [[H7425]] over Israel, [[H3478]] Jotham [[H3147]] son [[H1121]] of Uzziah [[H5818]] became king [[H4427]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
33 He was [[H1961]] twenty-five [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] sixteen [[H8337]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Jerusha [[H3388]] daughter [[H1323]] of Zadok. [[H6659]] 
34 And he did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] his father [[H1]] Uzziah [[H5818]] had done. [[H6213]] 
35 Nevertheless, [[H7535]] the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] taken away; [[H5493]] the people [[H5971]] continued [[H5750]] sacrificing [[H2076]] and burning incense [[H6999]] [there]. [[H1116]] Jotham [[H1931]] rebuilt [[H1129]] the Upper [[H5945]] Gate [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
36 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jotham, [[H3147]] along with his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] 
37 (In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] began [[H2490]] to send [[H7971]] Rezin [[H7526]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] and Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah [[H7425]] against Judah.) [[H3063]] 
38 And Jotham [[H3147]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] [them] [[H1]] in the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] his forefather. [[H1]] And his son [[H1121]] Ahaz [[H271]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
