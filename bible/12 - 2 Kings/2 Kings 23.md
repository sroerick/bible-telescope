1 Then the king [[H4428]] summoned [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah. [[H3063]] 
2 And [he] [[H4428]] went up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] the people [[H3427]] of Judah [[H3063]] [and] [[H3605]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] as well as [[H854]] the priests [[H3548]] and the prophets— [[H5030]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] small [[H6996]] and [[H5704]] great— [[H1419]] and in their hearing [[H241]] he read [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the Book [[H5612]] of the Covenant [[H1285]] that had been found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
3 So the king [[H4428]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the pillar [[H5982]] and made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] to follow [[H1980]] the LORD [[H3068]] and to keep [[H8104]] His commandments, [[H4687]] decrees, [[H5715]] and statutes [[H2708]] with all [[H3605]] [his] heart [[H3820]] and all [[H3605]] [his] soul, [[H5315]] and to carry out [[H6965]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant [[H1285]] that were written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] book. [[H5612]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] entered [[H5975]] into the covenant. [[H1285]] 
4 Then the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] the priests [[H3548]] second in rank, [[H4932]] and the doorkeepers [[H8104]] to remove [[H3318]] from the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] made [[H6213]] for Baal, [[H1168]] Asherah, [[H842]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven. [[H8064]] And he burned them [[H8313]] outside [[H2351]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] in the fields [[H7709]] of the Kidron [[H6939]] and carried [[H5375]] their ashes [[H6083]] to Bethel. [[H1008]] 
5 [Josiah] also did away with [[H7673]] the idolatrous priests [[H3649]] ordained [[H5414]] by the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] to burn incense [[H6999]] on the high places [[H1116]] of the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the places all around [[H4524]] Jerusalem— [[H3389]] those who had burned incense [[H6999]] to Baal, [[H1168]] to the sun [[H8121]] and moon, [[H3394]] to the constellations, [[H4208]] and to all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven. [[H8064]] 
6 He brought [[H3318]] the Asherah pole [[H842]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] the Kidron [[H6939]] Valley [[H5158]] outside [[H2351]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and [there] [[H6939]] he burned [[H8313]] it, [[H853]] ground [[H1854]] [it] to powder, [[H6083]] and threw [[H7993]] its dust [[H6083]] on [[H5921]] the graves [[H6913]] of the common [[H1121]] people. [[H5971]] 
7 He also tore down [[H5422]] the quarters [[H1004]] of the male cult prostitutes [[H6945]] that [were] [[H834]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] where [[H834]] the women [[H802]] had woven [[H707]] tapestries [[H1004]] for Asherah. [[H842]] 
8 Then Josiah brought [[H935]] all [[H3605]] the priests [[H3548]] from the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and desecrated [[H2930]] the high places, [[H1116]] from [[H834]] Geba [[H1387]] to [[H5704]] Beersheba, [[H884]] where [[H8033]] the priests [[H3548]] had burned incense. [[H6999]] He tore down [[H5422]] the high places [[H1116]] of the gates [[H8179]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of Joshua, [[H3091]] the governor [[H8269]] of the city, [[H5892]] which was [[H834]] to [[H5921]] the left [[H8040]] of the city [[H5892]] gate. [[H8179]] 
9 Although [[H389]] the priests [[H3548]] of the high places [[H1116]] did not [[H3808]] come up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] they ate [[H398]] unleavened bread [[H4682]] with [[H8432]] their fellow priests. [[H251]] 
10 He also desecrated [[H2930]] Topheth [[H8612]] in the Valley of Ben-hinnom [[H1516]] so that no [[H1115]] one [[H376]] could sacrifice [[H5674]] his son [[H1121]] or daughter [[H1323]] in the fire [[H784]] to Molech. [[H4432]] 
11 And he removed [[H7673]] from the entrance [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] the horses [[H5483]] that [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had dedicated [[H5414]] to the sun. [[H8121]] They were [[H834]] in the court [[H6503]] near [[H413]] the chamber [[H3957]] of  an official [[H5631]] named Nathan-melech. [[H5419]] And [[H853]] [Josiah] burned up [[H8313]] the chariots [[H4818]] of the sun. [[H8121]] 
12 He pulled down [[H5422]] the altars [[H4196]] that [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had set up [[H6213]] on [[H5921]] the roof [[H1406]] near the upper chamber [[H5944]] of Ahaz, [[H271]] and the altars [[H4196]] Manasseh [[H4519]] had set up [[H6213]] in the two [[H8147]] courtyards [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] The king [[H4428]] pulverized [[H7323]] them there [[H8033]] and threw [[H7993]] their dust [[H6083]] into [[H413]] the Kidron [[H6939]] Valley. [[H5158]] 
13 The king [[H4428]] also desecrated [[H2930]] the high places [[H1116]] east [[H5921]] of [[H6440]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to the south [[H3225]] of the Mount [[H2022]] of Corruption, [[H4889]] which [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] of Israel [[H3478]] had built [[H1129]] for Ashtoreth [[H6253]] the abomination [[H8251]] of the Sidonians, [[H6722]] for Chemosh [[H3645]] the abomination [[H8251]] of the Moabites, [[H4124]] and for Molech [[H4445]] the abomination [[H8441]] of the Ammonites. [[H1121]] 
14 He smashed the sacred pillars [[H4676]] to pieces, [[H7665]] cut down [[H3772]] the Asherah poles, [[H842]] and covered [[H4390]] the sites [[H4725]] with human [[H120]] bones. [[H6106]] 
15 He even [[H1571]] pulled down [[H5422]] the altar [[H4196]] at Bethel, [[H1008]] the high place [[H1116]] set up [[H6213]] by Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] who [[H834]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to sin. [[H2398]] Then he burned [[H8313]] the high place, [[H1116]] ground [it] [[H1854]] to powder, [[H6083]] and burned [[H8313]] the Asherah pole. [[H842]] 
16 And as Josiah [[H2977]] turned, [[H6437]] he saw [[H7200]] the tombs [[H6913]] there [[H8033]] on the hillside, [[H2022]] and he sent [[H7971]] someone to take [[H3947]] the bones [[H6106]] out of [[H4480]] the tombs, [[H6913]] and he burned [[H8313]] them on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] to defile it, [[H2930]] according to the word [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] proclaimed [[H7121]] by the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] who [[H834]] had foretold [[H7121]] these [[H428]] things. [[H1697]] 
17 Then [the king] asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] is this [[H1975]] monument [[H6725]] I [[H589]] see?” [[H7200]] And the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] replied, [[H559]] “It is the tomb [[H6913]] of the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] who [[H834]] came [[H935]] from Judah [[H3063]] and pronounced [[H7121]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] that [[H834]] you have done [[H6213]] to [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of  Bethel.” [[H1008]] 
18 “Let him rest,” [[H3240]] said [Josiah]. [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] let anyone [[H376]] disturb [[H5128]] his bones.” [[H6106]] So they left his bones [[H6106]] undisturbed, [[H4422]] along with those [[H6106]] of the prophet [[H5030]] who [[H834]] had come [[H935]] from Samaria. [[H8111]] 
19 Just as Josiah [[H6213]] had done [[H6213]] at Bethel, [[H1008]] [he] [[H2977]] also [[H1571]] removed [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] the shrines [[H1004]] of the high places [[H1116]] which [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] had set up [[H6213]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] provoking the LORD to anger. [[H3707]] 
20 On [[H5921]] the altars [[H4196]] he slaughtered [[H2076]] all [[H3605]] the priests [[H3548]] of the high places, [[H1116]] and he burned [[H8313]] human [[H120]] bones [[H6106]] on them. [[H5921]] Then he returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
21 The king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] “Keep [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] as [it is] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] Book [[H5612]] of the Covenant.” [[H1285]] 
22 No [[H3808]] such [[H2088]] Passover [[H6453]] had been observed [[H6213]] from the days [[H3117]] of the judges [[H8199]] who [[H834]] had governed [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] through all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah. [[H3063]] 
23 But [[H3588]] in the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Josiah [[H2977]] this [[H2088]] Passover [[H6453]] was observed [[H6213]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
24 Furthermore, [[H1571]] Josiah [[H2977]] removed [[H1197]] the mediums [[H178]] and [[H853]] spiritists, [[H3049]] the household gods [[H8655]] and [[H853]] idols, [[H1544]] and all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8251]] that [[H834]] were seen [[H7200]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] He did this [[H4616]] to carry out [[H6965]] the words [[H1697]] of the law [[H8451]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] that [[H834]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest [[H3548]] had found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
25 Neither [[H3808]] before [[H6440]] nor [[H3808]] after [Josiah] [[H310]] was there [[H6965]] any king [[H4428]] like him, [[H3644]] who [[H834]] turned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] his heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] his soul [[H5315]] and with all [[H3605]] his strength, [[H3966]] according to all [[H3605]] the Law [[H8451]] of Moses. [[H4872]] 
26 Nevertheless, [[H389]] the LORD [[H3068]] did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] from the fury [[H2740]] of His burning [[H1419]] anger, [[H639]] which [[H834]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Judah [[H3063]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Manasseh [[H4519]] had done [[H3708]] to provoke Him to anger. [[H3707]] 
27 For the LORD [[H3068]] had said, [[H559]] “I will also [[H1571]] remove [[H5493]] Judah [[H3063]] from [[H5921]] My sight, [[H6440]] just as [[H834]] I have removed [[H5493]] Israel. [[H3478]] I will reject [[H3988]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] I have chosen, [[H977]] and the temple [[H1004]] of which [[H834]] I said, [[H559]] My Name [[H8034]] shall be [[H1961]] there. [[H8033]] 
28 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] 
29 At the end of [Josiah's] reign, [[H3117]] Pharaoh  Neco [[H6549]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] marched up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] help the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] at [[H5921]] the Euphrates [[H6578]] River. [[H5104]] King [[H4428]] Josiah [[H2977]] went out [[H1980]] to confront him, [[H7125]] but Neco faced [[H7200]] him [[H853]] and killed him [[H4191]] at Megiddo. [[H4023]] 
30 From Megiddo [[H4023]] his servants [[H5650]] carried his body [[H4191]] in a chariot, [[H7392]] brought him to [[H935]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and buried [[H6912]] him in his own tomb. [[H6900]] Then the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] took [[H3947]] Jehoahaz [[H3059]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] anointed him, [[H4886]] and made him king [[H4427]] in place of [[H8478]] his father. [[H1]] 
31 Jehoahaz [[H3059]] was twenty-three [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] three [[H7969]] months. [[H2320]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Hamutal [[H2537]] daughter [[H1323]] of Jeremiah; [[H3414]] she was from Libnah. [[H3841]] 
32 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] his forefathers [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]] 
33 And Pharaoh  Neco [[H6549]] imprisoned Jehoahaz [[H631]] at Riblah [[H7247]] in the land [[H776]] of Hamath [[H2574]] so that he could not reign [[H4427]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and he imposed [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] [Judah] [[H776]] a levy [[H6066]] of a hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] and a talent [[H3603]] of gold. [[H2091]] 
34 Then Pharaoh  Neco [[H6549]] made Eliakim [[H471]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4427]] in place of [[H8478]] his father [[H1]] Josiah, [[H2977]] and he changed [[H5437]] Eliakim’s name [[H8034]] to Jehoiakim. [[H3079]] But Neco took [[H3947]] Jehoahaz [[H3059]] and carried him off [[H935]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] where he died. [[H4191]] 
35 So Jehoiakim [[H3079]] paid [[H5414]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] to Pharaoh [Neco], [[H6547]] but [[H389]] to meet [[H5921]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] demand [[H6310]] he taxed [[H6186]] the land [[H776]] and exacted [[H5065]] the silver [[H3701]] and the gold [[H2091]] from the people, [[H5971]] each [[H376]] according to his wealth. [[H6187]] 
36 Jehoiakim [[H3079]] was twenty-five [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] eleven [[H259]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Zebidah [[H2080]] daughter [[H1323]] of Pedaiah; [[H6305]] she was from [[H4480]] Rumah. [[H7316]] 
37 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] his fathers [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]]
