# Habakkuk 1
[[Nahum 3|←]] • [[Habakkuk 2|→]]
1 [This is] the oracle [[H4853]] that [[H834]] Habakkuk [[H2265]] the prophet [[H5030]] received in a vision: [[H2372]] 
2 How long, [[H5704]] O LORD, [[H3068]] must I call for help [[H7768]] but You do not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] or cry out [[H2199]] to You, [[H413]] “Violence!” [[H2555]] but You do not [[H3808]] save? [[H3467]] 
3 Why [[H4100]] do You make me see [[H7200]] iniquity? [[H205]] Why do You tolerate [[H5027]] wrongdoing? [[H5999]] Destruction [[H7701]] and violence [[H2555]] [are] before me. [[H5048]] Strife [[H7379]] is ongoing, [[H1961]] and conflict [[H4066]] abounds. [[H5375]] 
4 Therefore [[H5921]] the law [[H8451]] is paralyzed, [[H6313]] and justice [[H4941]] never [[H3808]] goes forth. [[H3318]] For [[H3588]] the wicked [[H7563]] hem in [[H3803]] the righteous; [[H6662]] therefore, [[H5921]] justice [[H4941]] is [[H3318]] perverted. [[H6127]] 
5 Look [[H7200]] at the nations [[H1471]] and observe— [[H5027]] be utterly astounded! [[H8539]] For [[H3588]] [I am] doing [[H6466]] a work [[H6467]] in your days [[H3117]] that you would never [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] even if [[H3588]] you were told. [[H5608]] 
6 For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I am raising up [[H6965]] the Chaldeans— [[H3778]] that ruthless [[H4751]] and impetuous [[H4116]] nation [[H1471]] that marches [[H1980]] through the breadth [[H4800]] of the earth [[H776]] to seize [[H3423]] dwelling places [[H4908]] not [[H3808]] their own.  
7 They [[H1931]] are dreaded [[H366]] and feared; [[H3372]] their justice [[H4941]] and sovereignty [[H7613]] proceed [[H3318]] from themselves. [[H4480]] 
8 Their horses [[H5483]] are swifter [[H7043]] than leopards, [[H5246]] fiercer [[H2300]] than wolves [[H2061]] of the night. [[H6153]] Their horsemen [[H6571]] charge ahead, [[H6335]] and their cavalry [[H6571]] comes [[H935]] from afar. [[H7350]] They fly [[H5774]] like a vulture, [[H5404]] swooping down [[H2363]] to devour. [[H398]] 
9 All [[H3605]] of them come [[H935]] bent [[H4041]] on violence; [[H2555]] their hordes [[H6440]] [advance like] the east [wind]; [[H6921]] they gather [[H622]] prisoners [[H7628]] like sand. [[H2344]] 
10 They [[H1931]] scoff at [[H7046]] kings [[H4428]] and {make} rulers [[H7336]] an object of scorn. [[H4890]] They [[H1931]] laugh [[H7832]] at every [[H3605]] fortress [[H4013]] and build up [[H6651]] siege ramps [[H6083]] to seize it. [[H3920]] 
11 Then [[H227]] they sweep by [[H2498]] like the wind [[H7307]] and pass on through. [[H5674]] They [[H2098]] are guilty; [[H816]] their own strength [[H3581]] is their god. [[H430]] 
12 Are You [[H859]] not [[H3808]] from everlasting, [[H6924]] O LORD, [[H3069]] my God, [[H430]] my Holy One? [[H6918]] We will not die. [[H4191]] O LORD, [[H3069]] You have appointed them [[H7760]] to execute judgment; [[H4941]] O Rock, [[H6697]] You have established them [[H3245]] for correction. [[H3198]] 
13 Your eyes [[H5869]] are too pure [[H2890]] to [[H4480]] look on [[H7200]] evil, [[H7451]] and You cannot [[H3808]] tolerate [[H5027]] wrongdoing. [[H5999]] So why [[H4100]] do You tolerate [[H5027]] the faithless? [[H898]] Why are You silent [[H2790]] while the wicked [[H7563]] swallow up [[H1104]] those more righteous than themselves? [[H6662]] 
14 You have made [[H6213]] men [[H120]] like the fish [[H1709]] of the sea, [[H3220]] like sea creatures [[H7431]] with no [[H3808]] ruler. [[H4910]] 
15 [The Chaldeans] bring all of them [[H3605]] up [[H5927]] with a hook; [[H2443]] they catch them [[H1641]] in their net, [[H2764]] and gather them [[H622]] in their dragnet; [[H4365]] so [[H5921]] they are glad [[H8055]] and rejoice. [[H1523]] 
16 Therefore [[H5921]] they sacrifice [[H2076]] to their dragnet [[H2764]] and burn incense [[H6999]] to their fishing net, [[H4365]] for [[H3588]] by these [[H1992]] things their portion [[H2506]] is sumptuous [[H8082]] and their food [[H3978]] is rich. [[H1277]] 
17 Will they, [[H5921]] therefore, [[H3651]] empty [[H7324]] their net [[H2764]] and continue [[H8548]] to slay [[H2026]] nations [[H1471]] without [[H3808]] mercy? [[H2550]]
