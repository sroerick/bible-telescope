1 I will stand [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] my guard post [[H4931]] and station [[H3320]] myself on [[H5921]] the ramparts. [[H4692]] I will watch [[H6822]] to see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] He will say [[H1696]] to me  and how [[H4100]] I will answer [[H7725]] my reproof. [[H8433]] 
2 Then the LORD [[H3068]] answered me: [[H6030]] “Write down [[H3789]] this vision [[H2377]] and clearly [[H874]] inscribe it on [[H5921]] tablets, [[H3871]] so that [[H4616]] a herald [[H7121]] may run [[H7323]] with it.  
3 For [[H3588]] the vision [[H2377]] awaits [[H5750]] an appointed time; [[H4150]] it testifies [[H6315]] of the end, [[H7093]] and will not [[H3808]] lie. [[H3576]] Though [[H518]] it lingers, [[H4102]] wait [[H2442]] for it,  since [[H3588]] it will surely come [[H935]] and not [[H3808]] delay. [[H309]] 
4 Look at [[H2009]] the proud one; [[H6075]] his soul [[H5315]] is not [[H3808]] upright— [[H3474]] but the righteous [[H6662]] will live [[H2421]] by his faith— [[H530]] 
5 furthermore, [[H637]] wine [[H3196]] betrays; [[H898]] an arrogant [[H3093]] man [[H1397]] is never [[H3808]] at rest. [[H5115]] He [[H834]] enlarges [[H7337]] his appetite [[H5315]] like Sheol, [[H7585]] and like Death, [[H4194]] he [[H1931]] is never [[H3808]] satisfied. [[H7646]] He gathers [[H622]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] to himself [[H413]] and collects [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] as his own. [[H413]] 
6 Will not [[H3808]] all [[H3605]] of these [[H428]] take up [[H5375]] a taunt [[H4912]] against him, [[H5921]] with mockery [[H4426]] and riddles [[H2420]] against him,  saying: [[H559]] ‘Woe [[H1945]] to him who amasses [[H7235]] what is not his [[H3808]] and makes himself rich [[H3513]] with many loans! [[H5671]] How [[H5704]] long will this go on?’ [[H4970]] 
7 Will not [[H3808]] your creditors [[H5391]] suddenly [[H6621]] arise [[H6965]] and those who disturb you [[H2111]] awaken? [[H6974]] Then you will become [[H1961]] their prey. [[H4933]] 
8 Because [[H3588]] you [[H859]] have plundered [[H7997]] many [[H7227]] nations, [[H1471]] the remnant [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] will plunder you [[H7997]] for your bloodshed [[H1818]] against man [[H120]] and your violence [[H2555]] against the land [[H776]] and city [[H7151]] and all [[H3605]] their dwellers. [[H3427]] 
9 Woe [[H1945]] to him who builds [[H1214]] his house [[H1004]] by unjust [[H7451]] gain, [[H1215]] to place [[H7760]] his nest [[H7064]] on high [[H4791]] [and] escape [[H5337]] the hand [[H3709]] of disaster! [[H7451]] 
10 You have plotted [[H3289]] shame [[H1322]] for your house [[H1004]] by cutting off [[H7096]] many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] and sinning [[H2398]] [against] your soul. [[H5315]] 
11 For [[H3588]] the stones [[H68]] will cry out [[H2199]] from the wall, [[H7023]] and the rafters [[H3714]] will echo it [[H6030]] from the woodwork. [[H6086]] 
12 Woe [[H1945]] to him who builds [[H1129]] a city [[H5892]] with bloodshed [[H1818]] and establishes [[H3559]] a town [[H7151]] by iniquity! [[H5766]] 
13 Is it not [[H3808]] indeed [[H2009]] from [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] that the labor [[H3021]] of the people [[H5971]] only feeds [[H1767]] the fire, [[H784]] and nations [[H3816]] weary themselves [[H3286]] in [[H1767]] vain? [[H7385]] 
14 For [[H3588]] the earth [[H776]] will be filled [[H4390]] with the knowledge [[H3045]] of [[H853]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] as the waters [[H4325]] cover [[H3680]] the sea. [[H3220]] 
15 Woe [[H1945]] to him who gives drink [[H8248]] to his neighbors, [[H7453]] pouring it [[H5596]] from the wineskin [[H2573]] until [[H637]] they are drunk, [[H7937]] in order to [[H4616]] gaze [[H5027]] at [[H5921]] their nakedness! [[H4589]] 
16 You will be filled [[H7646]] with shame [[H7036]] instead of glory. [[H3519]] You [[H859]] too [[H1571]] must drink [[H8354]] and expose your uncircumcision! [[H6188]] The cup [[H3563]] in the LORD’s [[H3068]] right hand [[H3225]] will come around [[H5437]] to you, [[H5921]] and utter disgrace [[H7022]] will cover your glory. [[H3519]] 
17 For [[H3588]] your violence [[H2555]] against Lebanon [[H3844]] will overwhelm you, [[H3680]] and the destruction [[H7701]] of animals [[H929]] will terrify you, [[H2865]] because of the blood [[H1818]] of men [[H120]] and violence [[H2555]] against lands, [[H776]] cities, [[H7151]] and everyone [[H3605]] in them. [[H3427]] 
18 What [[H4100]] use [[H3276]] is an idol, [[H6459]] that [[H3588]] a craftsman [[H3336]] should carve it— [[H6458]] [or] an image, [[H4541]] a teacher [[H3384]] of lies? [[H8267]] For [[H3588]] its maker [[H3335]] trusts [[H982]] in his own creation; [[H3335]] he makes [[H6213]] idols [[H457]] that cannot speak. [[H483]] 
19 Woe [[H1945]] to him who says [[H559]] to wood, [[H6086]] ‘Awaken!’ [[H6974]] or to silent [[H1748]] stone, [[H68]] ‘Come alive!’ [[H5782]] Can it [[H1931]] give guidance? [[H3384]] Behold, [[H2009]] it [is] [[H1931]] overlaid [[H8610]] with gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] yet there is no [[H369]] breath [[H7307]] in [[H7130]] it at all. [[H3605]] 
20 But the LORD [[H3068]] is in His holy [[H6944]] temple; [[H1964]] let all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] be silent [[H2013]] before Him.” [[H6440]]
