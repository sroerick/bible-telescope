# Habakkuk 3
[[Habakkuk 2|←]] • [[Zephaniah 1|→]]
1 [This is] a prayer [[H8605]] of Habakkuk [[H2265]] the prophet, [[H5030]] according to [[H5921]] Shigionoth: [[H7692]] 
2 O LORD, [[H3068]] I have heard [[H8085]] the report of You; [[H8088]] I stand in awe, [[H3372]] O LORD, [[H3068]] of Your deeds. [[H6467]] Revive them [[H2421]] in [[H7130]] these years; [[H8141]] make them known [[H3045]] in [[H7130]] these years. [[H8141]] In Your wrath, [[H7267]] remember [[H2142]] mercy! [[H7355]] 
3 God [[H433]] came [[H935]] from Teman, [[H8487]] and the Holy One [[H6918]] from Mount [[H2022]] Paran. [[H6290]] Selah [[H5542]] His glory [[H1935]] covered [[H3680]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and His praise [[H8416]] filled [[H4390]] the earth. [[H776]] 
4 [His] radiance [[H5051]] was [[H1961]] like the sunlight; [[H216]] rays [flashed] [[H7161]] from His hand, [[H3027]] where [[H8033]] His power [[H5797]] is hidden. [[H2253]] 
5 Plague [[H1698]] went [[H1980]] before Him, [[H6440]] and pestilence [[H7565]] followed [[H3318]] in His steps. [[H7272]] 
6 He stood [[H5975]] and measured [[H4058]] the earth; [[H776]] He looked [[H7200]] and startled [[H5425]] the nations; [[H1471]] the ancient [[H5703]] mountains [[H2042]] were scattered; [[H6327]] the perpetual [[H5769]] hills [[H1389]] bowed. [[H7817]] His  ways [are] [[H1979]] everlasting. [[H5769]] 
7 I saw [[H7200]] the tents [[H168]] of Cushan [[H3572]] in [[H8478]] distress; [[H205]] the curtains [[H3407]] of Midian [[H4080]] were trembling. [[H7264]] 
8 Were You angry [[H2734]] at the rivers, [[H5104]] O LORD? [[H3068]] Was Your wrath [[H639]] against the streams? [[H5104]] Did You rage [[H5678]] against the sea [[H3220]] when [[H3588]] You rode [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] Your horses, [[H5483]] on Your chariots [[H4818]] of salvation? [[H3444]] 
9 You brandished [[H6181]] Your bow; [[H7198]] You called for [[H562]] many arrows. [[H4294]] Selah [[H5542]] You split [[H1234]] the earth [[H776]] with rivers. [[H5104]] 
10 The mountains [[H2022]] saw You [[H7200]] [and] quaked; [[H2342]] torrents [[H2230]] of water [[H4325]] swept by. [[H5674]] The deep [[H8415]] roared [[H5414]] with its voice [[H6963]] and lifted [[H5375]] its hands [[H3027]] on high. [[H7315]] 
11 Sun [[H8121]] and moon [[H3394]] stood still [[H5975]] in their places [[H2073]] at the flash [[H216]] of Your flying [[H1980]] arrows, [[H2671]] at the brightness [[H5051]] of Your shining [[H1300]] spear. [[H2595]] 
12 You marched [[H6805]] across the earth [[H776]] with fury; [[H2195]] You threshed [[H1758]] the nations [[H1471]] in wrath. [[H639]] 
13 You went forth [[H3318]] for the salvation [[H3468]] of Your people, [[H5971]] to save [[H3468]] Your anointed. [[H4899]] You crushed [[H4272]] the head [[H7218]] of the house [[H1004]] of the wicked [[H7563]] and stripped him [[H6168]] from head [[H6677]] to [[H5704]] foot. [[H3247]] Selah [[H5542]] 
14 With his own spear [[H4294]] You pierced [[H5344]] his head, [[H7218]] when his warriors [[H6518]] stormed out [[H5590]] to scatter us, [[H6327]] gloating [[H5951]] as though ready [[H3644]] to secretly [[H4565]] devour [[H398]] the weak. [[H6041]] 
15 You trampled [[H1869]] the sea [[H3220]] with Your horses, [[H5483]] churning [[H2563]] the great [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]] 
16 I heard [[H8085]] and trembled [[H7264]] within; [[H990]] my lips [[H8193]] quivered [[H6750]] at the sound. [[H6963]] Decay [[H7538]] entered [[H935]] my bones; [[H6106]] I trembled [[H7264]] where I stood. [[H8478]] Yet I must wait patiently [[H5117]] for the day [[H3117]] of distress [[H6869]] to come upon [[H5927]] the people [[H5971]] who invade us. [[H1464]] 
17 Though [[H3588]] the fig tree [[H8384]] does not [[H3808]] bud [[H6524]] and no [[H369]] fruit [[H2981]] [is] on the vines, [[H1612]] though the olive [[H2132]] crop [[H4639]] fails [[H3584]] and the fields [[H7709]] produce [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] food, [[H400]] though the sheep [[H6629]] are cut off [[H1504]] from the fold [[H4356]] and no [[H369]] cattle [[H1241]] [are] in the stalls, [[H7517]] 
18 yet I [[H589]] will exult [[H5937]] in the LORD; [[H3068]] I will rejoice [[H1523]] in the God [[H430]] of my salvation! [[H3468]] 
19 GOD [[H3069]] the Lord [[H136]] is my strength; [[H2428]] He makes [[H7760]] my feet [[H7272]] like those of a deer; [[H355]] He makes me walk [[H1869]] upon [[H5921]] the heights! [[H1116]] For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] With stringed instruments. [[H5058]]
