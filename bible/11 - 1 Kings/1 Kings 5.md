1 Now when Hiram [[H2438]] king [[H4428]] of Tyre [[H6865]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] [Solomon] had been anointed [[H4886]] king [[H4428]] in his father’s [[H1]] place, [[H8478]] he sent [[H7971]] envoys [[H5650]] to [[H413]] Solomon; [[H8010]] for [[H3588]] Hiram [[H2438]] had always [[H3605]] been [[H1961]] friends [[H157]] with David. [[H1732]] 
2 And Solomon [[H8010]] relayed [[H7971]] this message [[H559]] to [[H413]] Hiram: [[H2438]] 
3 “As you [[H859]] are aware, [[H3045]] because [[H6440]] of the wars waged [[H4421]] on all sides [[H5437]] against my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] he could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] until [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] had put [[H5414]] his enemies under [[H8478]] his feet. [[H3709]] 
4 But now [[H6258]] the LORD [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] has given me rest [[H5117]] on every side, [[H5439]] and there is no [[H369]] adversary [[H7854]] or crisis. [[H6294]] 
5 So behold, [[H2005]] I plan [[H559]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] according to what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] my father [[H1]] David: [[H1732]] ‘I will put [[H5414]] your son [[H1121]] on [[H5921]] your throne [[H3678]] in your place, [[H8478]] and he [[H1931]] will build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] for My Name. [[H8034]] 
6 Now therefore, [[H6258]] order [[H6680]] that cedars [[H730]] of [[H4480]] Lebanon [[H3844]] be cut down [[H3772]] for me.  My servants [[H5650]] will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] your servants, [[H5650]] and I will pay [[H5414]] your servants [[H5650]] whatever wages [[H7939]] you set, [[H559]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] [there are] none [[H369]] among us  as skilled [[H3045]] in logging [[H3772]] as the Sidonians. [[H6722]] 
7 When Hiram [[H2438]] received [[H8085]] Solomon’s [[H8010]] message, [[H1697]] he rejoiced [[H8055]] greatly [[H3966]] and said, [[H559]] “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] this day! [[H3117]] He [[H834]] has given [[H5414]] David [[H1732]] a wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] over [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] great [[H7227]] people!” [[H5971]] 
8 Then Hiram [[H2438]] sent [[H7971]] a reply to [[H413]] Solomon, [[H8010]] saying: [[H559]] “I have received [[H8085]] your message; [[H834]] I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] you desire [[H2656]] regarding the cedar [[H730]] and cypress [[H1265]] timber. [[H6086]] 
9 My servants [[H5650]] will haul the logs [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] Lebanon [[H3844]] to the sea, [[H3220]] and I [[H589]] will float them [[H7760]] in rafts [[H1702]] by sea [[H3220]] to [[H5704]] the place [[H4725]] you specify. [[H7971]] There [[H8033]] I will separate [the logs], [[H5310]] and you [[H859]] can take them away. [[H5375]] And in exchange, you [[H859]] can meet [[H6213]] my needs [[H2656]] by providing [[H5414]] my household [[H1004]] with food. [[H3899]] 
10 So [[H1961]] Hiram [[H2438]] provided [[H5414]] Solomon [[H8010]] with all [[H3605]] the cedar [[H730]] and cypress [[H1265]] timber [[H6086]] he wanted, [[H2656]] 
11 and year [[H8141]] after year [[H8141]] Solomon [[H8010]] would provide [[H5414]] Hiram [[H2438]] with twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] cors [[H3734]] of wheat [[H2406]] as food [[H4361]] for his household, [[H1004]] as well as twenty [thousand] [[H6242]] baths [[H3734]] of pure olive oil. [[H8081]] 
12 And the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] Solomon [[H8010]] wisdom, [[H2451]] as [[H834]] He had promised [[H1696]] him.  There was [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] between [[H996]] Hiram [[H2438]] and Solomon, [[H8010]] and the two [[H8147]] of them made [[H3772]] a treaty. [[H1285]] 
13 Then King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] conscripted [[H5927]] a labor force [[H4522]] of thirty [[H7970]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] from all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
14 He sent them [[H7971]] to Lebanon [[H3844]] in monthly [[H2320]] shifts [[H2487]] of ten [[H6235]] thousand, [[H505]] so that they would spend [[H1961]] one month [[H2320]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] [and] two [[H8147]] months [[H2320]] at home. [[H1004]] And Adoniram [was] [[H141]] in charge [[H5921]] of the labor force. [[H4522]] 
15 Solomon [[H8010]] had [[H1961]] 70,000 {} [[H7657]] porters [[H5375]] and 80,000 {} [[H8084]] stonecutters [[H2672]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] 
16 not including [[H905]] his [[H8010]] 3,300 {} [[H7969]] foremen [[H8269]] who supervised [[H7287]] the workers. [[H5971]] 
17 And the king [[H4428]] commanded them [[H6680]] to quarry [[H5265]] large, [[H1419]] costly [[H3368]] stones [[H68]] to lay the foundation [[H3245]] of the temple [[H1004]] with dressed [[H1496]] stones. [[H68]] 
18 So Solomon’s [[H8010]] and Hiram’s [[H2438]] builders, [[H1129]] along with the Gebalites, [[H1382]] quarried the stone [[H6458]] and prepared [[H3559]] the timber [[H6086]] and stone [[H68]] for the construction [[H1129]] of the temple. [[H1004]]
