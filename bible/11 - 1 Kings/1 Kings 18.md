1 After [[H1961]] a long [[H7227]] time, [[H3117]] in the third [[H7992]] year [of the drought], [[H8141]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Elijah: [[H452]] “Go [[H1980]] and present [[H7200]] yourself to [[H413]] Ahab, [[H256]] and I will send [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth.” [[H127]] 
2 So Elijah [[H452]] went [[H1980]] to present [[H7200]] himself to [[H413]] Ahab. [[H256]] The famine [[H7458]] was severe [[H2389]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] 
3 and Ahab [[H256]] summoned [[H7121]] Obadiah, [[H5662]] who [[H834]] was in charge of [[H5921]] the palace. [[H1004]] (Now Obadiah [[H5662]] greatly [[H3966]] feared [[H3373]] the LORD, [[H3068]] 
4 for when Jezebel [[H348]] had slaughtered [[H3772]] the prophets [[H5030]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] Obadiah [[H5662]] had taken [[H3947]] a hundred [[H3967]] prophets [[H5030]] and hidden them, [[H2244]] fifty [[H2572]] men [[H376]] per cave, [[H4631]] providing [[H3557]] them with food [[H3899]] and water.) [[H4325]] 
5 Then Ahab [[H256]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Obadiah, [[H5662]] “Go [[H1980]] throughout the land [[H776]] to [[H413]] every [[H3605]] spring [[H4599]] and [[H413]] every [[H3605]] valley. [[H5158]] Perhaps [[H194]] we will find [[H4672]] grass [[H2682]] to keep the horses [[H5483]] and mules [[H6505]] alive [[H2421]] so that we will not [[H3808]] have to destroy [[H3772]] any livestock. [[H929]] 
6 So they divided [[H2505]] the land [[H776]] to explore. [[H5674]] Ahab [[H256]] went [[H1980]] one [[H259]] way [[H1870]] by himself, [[H905]] and Obadiah [[H5662]] went [[H1980]] the other [[H259]] way [[H1870]] by himself. [[H905]] 
7 Now as Obadiah [[H5662]] went [[H1961]] on [his] way, [[H1870]] Elijah [[H452]] suddenly [[H2009]] met him. [[H7125]] When Obadiah recognized him, [[H5234]] he fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H6440]] and said, [[H559]] “Is it [[H2088]] you, [[H859]] my lord [[H113]] Elijah?” [[H452]] 
8 “[It is] I,” [[H589]] he answered. [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] tell [[H559]] your master, [[H113]] ‘Elijah [[H452]] is here!’” [[H2009]] 
9 But Obadiah replied, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] have I sinned, [[H2398]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are handing your servant [[H5650]] over to [[H5414]] Ahab [[H256]] to put me to death? [[H4191]] 
10 As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] lives, [[H2416]] there is [[H3426]] no [[H518]] nation [[H1471]] or kingdom [[H4467]] where [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] has not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] someone to search for you. [[H1245]] When they said, [[H559]] ‘[He is] not [here],’ [[H369]] he made that kingdom [[H4467]] or nation [[H1471]] swear [[H7650]] they had not [[H3808]] found you. [[H4672]] 
11 And now [[H6258]] you [[H859]] say, [[H559]] ‘Go [[H1980]] tell [[H559]] your master [that] [[H113]] Elijah [[H452]] is here!’ [[H2009]] 
12 I do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] where [[H5921]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] may carry you off [[H5375]] when I [[H589]] leave [[H1980]] you. [[H853]] Then when I go [[H935]] [and] tell [[H5046]] Ahab [[H256]] and he does not [[H3808]] find you, [[H4672]] he will kill me. [[H2026]] But I, your servant, [[H5650]] have feared [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] from my youth. [[H5271]] 
13 Was it not [[H3808]] reported [[H5046]] to my lord [[H113]] what [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] when Jezebel [[H348]] slaughtered [[H2026]] the prophets [[H5030]] of the LORD? [[H3068]] I hid [[H2244]] a hundred [[H3967]] prophets [[H5030]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] fifty [[H2572]] men [[H376]] to a cave, [[H4631]] and I provided [[H3557]] them with food [[H3899]] and water. [[H4325]] 
14 And now [[H6258]] you [[H859]] say, [[H559]] ‘Go [[H1980]] tell [[H559]] your lord [[H113]] that Elijah [[H452]] is here!’ [[H2009]] He will kill me!” [[H2026]] 
15 Then Elijah [[H452]] said, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] lives, [[H2416]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] I stand, [[H5975]] I will present myself [[H7200]] to Ahab [[H413]] today.” [[H3117]] 
16 So Obadiah [[H5662]] went [[H1980]] to [[H7125]] inform [[H5046]] Ahab, [[H256]] [who] [[H256]] went [[H1980]] to meet [[H7125]] Elijah. [[H452]] 
17 When Ahab [[H256]] saw [[H7200]] Elijah, [[H452]] [he] [[H256]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Is that [[H2088]] you, [[H859]] O troubler [[H5916]] of Israel?” [[H3478]] 
18 “I have not [[H3808]] troubled [[H5916]] Israel,” [[H3478]] [Elijah] replied, [[H559]] “but [[H3588]] you [[H859]] and your father’s [[H1]] house [have], [[H1004]] for you have forsaken [[H5800]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and have followed [[H1980]] the Baals. [[H1168]] 
19 Now [[H6258]] summon [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] to meet [[H6908]] me [[H413]] on [[H413]] Mount [[H2022]] Carmel, [[H3760]] along with [[H853]] the four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] prophets [[H5030]] of Baal [[H1168]] and four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] prophets [[H5030]] of Asherah [[H842]] who eat [[H398]] at Jezebels [[H348]] table. [[H7979]] 
20 So Ahab [[H256]] summoned [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and assembled [[H6908]] the prophets [[H5030]] on [[H413]] Mount [[H2022]] Carmel. [[H3760]] 
21 Then Elijah [[H452]] approached [[H5066]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] and said, [[H559]] “How long [[H5704]] will you [[H859]] waver [[H6452]] between [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] opinions? [[H5587]] If [[H518]] the LORD [[H3068]] is God, [[H430]] follow [[H1980]] Him. [[H310]] But if [[H518]] Baal [is], [[H1168]] follow [[H1980]] him.” [[H310]] But the people [[H5971]] did not [[H3808]] answer [[H6030]] a word. [[H1697]] 
22 Then Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] “I [[H589]] am the only [[H905]] remaining [[H3498]] prophet [[H5030]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] but Baal [has] [[H1168]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] prophets. [[H5030]] 
23 Get [[H5414]] two [[H8147]] bulls [[H6499]] for us.  Let [the prophets of Baal] choose [[H977]] one [[H259]] bull [[H6499]] for themselves, [[H1992]] cut it into pieces, [[H5408]] and place [[H7760]] it on [[H5921]] the wood, [[H6086]] but not [[H3808]] light [[H7760]] the fire. [[H784]] And I [[H589]] will prepare [[H6213]] the other [[H259]] bull [[H6499]] and place [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] the wood, [[H6086]] but not [[H3808]] light [[H7760]] the fire. [[H784]] 
24 Then you may call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of your god, [[H430]] and I [[H589]] will call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] The God [[H430]] who [[H834]] answers [[H6030]] by fire, [[H784]] He [[H1931]] is [[H1961]] God.” [[H430]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] answered, [[H559]] “What you say [[H1697]] is good.” [[H2896]] 
25 Then Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] to the prophets [[H5030]] of Baal, [[H1168]] “Since [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are so numerous, [[H7227]] choose [[H977]] for yourselves  one [[H259]] bull [[H6499]] and prepare [[H6213]] it first. [[H7223]] Then call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of your god, [[H430]] but do not [[H3808]] light [[H7760]] the fire.” [[H784]] 
26 And they took [[H3947]] the bull [[H6499]] that [[H834]] was given [[H5414]] them,  prepared [it], [[H6213]] and called [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of Baal [[H1168]] from morning [[H1242]] until [[H5704]] noon, [[H6672]] shouting, [[H559]] “O Baal, [[H1168]] answer us!” [[H6030]] But there was no [[H369]] sound, [[H6963]] and no one [[H369]] answered [[H6030]] as they leaped [[H6452]] around [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] they had made. [[H6213]] 
27 At noon [[H6672]] Elijah [[H452]] began to taunt [[H2048]] them,  saying, [[H559]] “Shout [[H7121]] louder, [[H1419]] for [[H3588]] he is [[H1931]] a god! [[H430]] Perhaps he is deep in thought, [[H7879]] or occupied, [[H7873]] or on a journey. [[H1870]] Perhaps [[H194]] he is [[H1931]] sleeping [[H3463]] and must be awakened!” [[H3364]] 
28 So they shouted louder [[H7121]] and cut [[H1413]] themselves with knives [[H2719]] and lances, [[H7420]] as [was] their custom, [[H4941]] until [[H5704]] the blood [[H1818]] gushed out [[H8210]] upon them. [[H5921]] 
29 Midday passed, [[H5674]] and they kept on raving [[H5012]] until [[H5704]] the [time] [[H5927]] of the [evening] sacrifice. [[H4503]] But [there was] no [[H369]] response, [[H6963]] no [[H369]] one answered, [[H6030]] no [[H369]] one paid attention. [[H7182]] 
30 Then Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] to all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] “Come near [[H5066]] to me.” [[H413]] So all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] approached him, [[H5066]] and he repaired [[H7495]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that had been torn down. [[H2040]] 
31 And Elijah [[H452]] took [[H3947]] twelve [[H8147]] stones— [[H68]] one for each [[H4557]] tribe [[H7626]] of Jacob's [[H3290]] descendants [[H1121]] to [[H413]] whom [[H834]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had come [[H1961]] and said, [[H559]] “Israel [[H3478]] shall be [[H1961]] your name.” [[H8034]] 
32 And with the stones, [[H68]] [Elijah] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Then he dug [[H6213]] a trench [[H8585]] around [[H5439]] the altar [[H4196]] large enough to hold [[H1004]] two seahs [[H5429]] of seed. [[H2233]] 
33 Next, he arranged [[H6186]] the wood, [[H6086]] cut up [[H5408]] the bull, [[H6499]] placed [[H7760]] it on [[H5921]] the wood, [[H6086]] 
34 and said, [[H559]] “Fill [[H4390]] four [[H702]] waterpots [[H4325]] and pour [the water] [[H3332]] on [[H5921]] the offering [[H5930]] and on [[H5921]] the wood.” [[H6086]] “Do [it] a second time,” [[H8138]] he said, [[H559]] and they did it a second time. [[H8138]] “Do [it] a third time,” [[H8027]] he said, [[H559]] and they did it a third time. [[H8027]] 
35 So the water [[H4325]] ran down [[H1980]] around [[H5439]] the altar [[H4196]] and even [[H1571]] filled [[H4390]] the trench. [[H8585]] 
36 At the time of [[H5927]] the evening sacrifice, [[H4503]] Elijah [[H452]] the prophet [[H5030]] approached [[H5066]] the altar and said, [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Israel, [[H3478]] let it be known [[H3045]] this day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are God [[H430]] in Israel [[H3478]] and that I [am] [[H589]] Your servant [[H5650]] and have done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] at Your command. [[H1697]] 
37 Answer me, [[H6030]] O LORD! [[H3068]] Answer me, [[H6030]] so that this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] the LORD, [[H3068]] are God, [[H430]] and that You [[H859]] have turned [[H5437]] their hearts [[H3820]] back again.” [[H322]] 
38 Then the fire [[H784]] of the LORD [[H3068]] fell [[H5307]] and consumed [[H398]] the sacrifice, [[H5930]] the wood, [[H6086]] the stones, [[H68]] and the dust, [[H6083]] and it licked up [[H3897]] the water [[H4325]] in the trench. [[H8585]] 
39 When all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] saw this, [[H7200]] they fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H5921]] and said, [[H559]] “The LORD, [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] is God! [[H430]] The LORD, [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] is God!” [[H430]] 
40 Then Elijah [[H452]] ordered them, [[H559]] “Seize [[H8610]] the prophets [[H5030]] of Baal! [[H1168]] Do not [[H408]] let a single one [[H376]] escape.” [[H4422]] So they seized them, [[H8610]] and Elijah [[H452]] brought them down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the Kishon [[H7028]] Valley [[H5158]] and slaughtered [[H7819]] them there. [[H8033]] 
41 And Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] to Ahab, [[H256]] “Go up, [[H5927]] eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] for [[H3588]] there is the sound [[H6963]] of a heavy [[H1995]] rain.” [[H1653]] 
42 So Ahab [[H256]] went up [[H5927]] to eat [[H398]] and drink. [[H8354]] But Elijah [[H452]] climbed [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the summit [[H7218]] of Carmel, [[H3760]] bent down [[H1457]] on the ground, [[H776]] and put [[H7760]] his face [[H6440]] between [[H996]] his knees. [[H1290]] 
43 “Go [[H5927]] and look [[H5027]] toward [[H1870]] the sea,” [[H3220]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his servant. [[H5288]] So [the servant] went [[H5927]] and looked, [[H5027]] and he said, [[H559]] “[There is] nothing there.” [[H369]] Seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] Elijah said, [[H559]] “Go back.” [[H7725]] 
44 On the seventh time [[H7637]] [the servant] reported, [[H559]] “There is [[H2009]] a cloud [[H5645]] as small [[H6996]] as a man’s [[H376]] hand [[H3709]] rising [[H5927]] from the sea.” [[H3220]] And Elijah replied, [[H559]] “Go [[H5927]] and tell [[H559]] Ahab, [[H256]] ‘Prepare [your chariot] [[H631]] and go down [[H3381]] before the rain [[H1653]] stops you.’” [[H6113]] 
45 Meanwhile, [[H1961]] the sky [[H8064]] grew dark [[H6937]] with clouds [[H5645]] and wind, [[H7307]] and a heavy [[H1419]] rain [[H1653]] began to fall. [[H1961]] So Ahab [[H256]] rode away [[H7392]] and went [[H1980]] to Jezreel. [[H3157]] 
46 And the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H413]] Elijah, [[H452]] and he tucked his cloak [[H8151]] into his belt [[H4975]] and ran [[H7323]] ahead of [[H6440]] Ahab [[H256]] all the way to [[H5704]] Jezreel. [[H3157]]
