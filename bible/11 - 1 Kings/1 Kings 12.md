1 Then Rehoboam [[H7346]] went [[H1980]] to Shechem, [[H7927]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] had gone [[H935]] [there] [[H7927]] to make him king. [[H4427]] 
2 When Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] heard about this, [[H8085]] he was [[H1931]] still [[H5750]] in Egypt [[H4714]] where [[H834]] he had fled [[H1272]] from King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] and had been [[H3379]] living ever since. [[H3427]] 
3 So they sent for [[H7971]] [Jeroboam],  and [he] [[H3379]] and the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] and said, [[H1696]] 
4 “Your father [[H1]] put a heavy [[H7185]] yoke [[H5923]] on us. [[H853]] But now [[H6258]] you [[H859]] should lighten [[H7043]] the burden [[H7186]] of your father’s [[H1]] service [[H5656]] and the heavy [[H3515]] yoke [[H5923]] he put [[H5414]] on us, [[H5921]] and we will serve you.” [[H5647]] 
5 Rehoboam answered, [[H559]] “Go away [[H1980]] for [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] and then return [[H7725]] to me.” [[H413]] So the people [[H5971]] departed. [[H1980]] 
6 Then King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] consulted [[H3289]] with [[H854]] the elders [[H2205]] who [[H834]] had served [[H5975]] his father [[H1]] Solomon [[H8010]] during [[H1961]] his lifetime. [[H2416]] “How [[H349]] do you [[H859]] advise [[H3289]] me to respond [[H7725]] to these [[H2088]] people?” [[H5971]] he asked. [[H559]] 
7 They replied, [[H1696]] “If [[H518]] you will be [[H1961]] a servant [[H5650]] to these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] and serve them [[H5647]] this day, [[H3117]] and if you will respond [[H6030]] by speaking [[H1696]] kind [[H2896]] words [[H1697]] to them, [[H413]] they will be [[H1961]] your servants [[H5650]] forever.” [[H3605]] 
8 But [Rehoboam] rejected [[H5800]] the advice [[H6098]] of the elders; [[H2205]] instead, he consulted [[H3289]] the young men [[H3206]] who [[H834]] had grown up [[H1431]] with him [[H854]] and served [[H5975]] him. [[H6440]] 
9 He asked [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “What [[H4100]] message [[H1697]] do you [[H859]] advise [[H3289]] that we send back [[H7725]] to these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] have spoken [[H1696]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Lighten [[H7043]] the yoke [[H5923]] your father [[H1]] put [[H5414]] on us’?” [[H5921]] 
10 The young men [[H3206]] who [[H834]] had grown up [[H1431]] with him [[H854]] replied, [[H1696]] “This is how [[H3541]] you should answer [[H559]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] said [[H1696]] to you, [[H413]] ‘Your father [[H1]] made our yoke [[H5923]] heavy, [[H3513]] but you [[H859]] should make it lighter.’ [[H7043]] This is what [[H3541]] you should tell [[H1696]] them: [[H413]] ‘My little finger [[H6995]] is thicker [[H5666]] than my father’s [[H1]] waist! [[H4975]] 
11 Although [[H6258]] my father [[H1]] burdened [[H6006]] you with a heavy [[H3515]] yoke, [[H5923]] I [[H589]] will add [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] your yoke. [[H5923]] Although my father [[H1]] scourged [[H3256]] you [[H853]] with whips, [[H7752]] I [[H589]] will scourge [[H3256]] you [[H853]] with scorpions.’” [[H6137]] 
12 After three [[H7992]] days, [[H3117]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam, [[H7346]] since [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] had said, [[H1696]] “Come back [[H7725]] to me [[H413]] on the third [[H7992]] day.” [[H3117]] 
13 And the king [[H4428]] answered [[H6030]] the people [[H5971]] harshly. [[H7186]] He rejected [[H5800]] the advice [[H6098]] of the elders [[H2205]] 
14 and spoke [[H1696]] to them [[H413]] as the young men [[H3206]] had advised, [[H6098]] saying, [[H559]] “Although my father [[H1]] made your yoke [[H5923]] heavy, [[H3513]] I [[H589]] will add [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] your yoke. [[H5923]] Although my father [[H1]] scourged [[H3256]] you [[H853]] with whips, [[H7752]] I [[H589]] will scourge [[H3256]] you [[H853]] with scorpions! [[H6137]] 
15 So the king [[H4428]] did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] and indeed [[H3588]] this turn of events [[H5438]] was [[H1961]] from [[H5973]] the LORD, [[H3068]] to [[H4616]] fulfill [[H6965]] the word [[H1697]] [He] [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] through [[H3027]] Ahijah [[H281]] the Shilonite. [[H7888]] 
16 When all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] had refused [[H3808]] to listen [[H8085]] to them, [[H413]] [they] [[H5971]] answered [[H7725]] the king: [[H4428]] “What [[H4100]] portion [[H2506]] do we have  in David, [[H1732]] and what [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] in the son [[H1121]] of Jesse? [[H3448]] To your tents, [[H168]] O Israel! [[H3478]] Look [[H7200]] now [[H6258]] to your own house, [[H1004]] O David! [[H1732]] So the Israelites [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] home, [[H168]] 
17 but Rehoboam [[H7346]] still reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] the Israelites [[H1121]] living [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
18 Then King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] sent out [[H7971]] Adoram, [[H151]] who [[H834]] was in charge [[H5921]] of the labor force, [[H4522]] but all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] stoned [[H7275]] him to death. [[H4191]] And King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] mounted [[H5927]] his chariot [[H4818]] in haste [[H553]] and escaped [[H5127]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
19 So to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] Israel [[H3478]] has been in rebellion [[H6586]] against the house [[H1004]] of David. [[H1732]] 
20 When all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] had returned, [[H7725]] they summoned [[H7971]] him to [[H413]] the assembly [[H5712]] and made him king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] Only [[H3808]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Judah [[H3063]] followed [[H310]] the house [[H1004]] of David. [[H1732]] 
21 And when Rehoboam [[H7346]] arrived [[H935]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] he mobilized [[H6950]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the tribe [[H7626]] of Benjamin— [[H1144]] 180,000 {} [[H3967]] choice [[H970]] warriors— [[H4421]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and restore [[H7725]] the kingdom [[H4410]] to Rehoboam [[H7346]] son [[H1121]] of Solomon. [[H8010]] 
22 But the word [[H1697]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the man [[H376]] of God: [[H430]] 
23 “Tell [[H559]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] son [[H1121]] of Solomon [[H8010]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] and the rest [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] 
24 that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘You are not [[H3808]] to go up [[H5927]] and fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] your brothers, [[H251]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] Each [[H376]] of you must return [[H7725]] home, [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] is [[H1961]] from Me.’” [[H853]] So they listened [[H8085]] to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3069]] and turned back [[H7725]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3069]] 
25 Then Jeroboam [[H3379]] built [[H1129]] Shechem [[H7927]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and lived there. [[H3427]] And from  there [[H8033]] he went out [[H3318]] and built [[H1129]] Penuel. [[H6439]] 
26 Jeroboam [[H3379]] said [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] “Now, [[H6258]] the kingdom [[H4467]] might revert [[H7725]] to the house [[H1004]] of David. [[H1732]] 
27 If [[H518]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] go up [[H5927]] to offer [[H6213]] sacrifices [[H2077]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] their hearts [[H3820]] will return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] their lord, [[H113]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] king [[H4428]] of Judah; [[H3063]] then they will kill [[H2026]] me and return [[H7725]] to Rehoboam [[H7346]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
28 After seeking advice, [[H3289]] the king [[H4428]] made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] golden [[H2091]] calves [[H5695]] and said [[H559]] to the people, [[H413]] “Going [[H5927]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] is too much [[H7227]] for you.  Here, [[H2009]] O Israel, [[H3478]] are your gods, [[H430]] which [[H834]] brought you up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt.” [[H4714]] 
29 One [calf] [[H259]] he set up [[H7760]] in Bethel, [[H1008]] [and] [[H5414]] the other [[H259]] in Dan. [[H1835]] 
30 And this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] became [[H1961]] a sin; [[H2403]] the people [[H5971]] walked [[H1980]] as far as [[H5704]] Dan [to worship] [[H1835]] before [[H6440]] one [of the calves]. [[H259]] 
31 Jeroboam also built [[H6213]] shrines [[H1004]] on the high places [[H1116]] and appointed [[H6213]] from every class [[H7098]] of people [[H5971]] priests [[H3548]] who [[H834]] were [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] Levites. [[H1121]] 
32 And Jeroboam [[H3379]] ordained [[H6213]] a festival [[H2282]] on the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the eighth [[H8066]] month, [[H2320]] like the festival [[H2282]] that [was] [[H834]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and he offered sacrifices [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] the altar; [[H4196]] he made [[H6213]] this [[H3651]] offering in Bethel [[H1008]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] to the calves [[H5695]] he had set up, [[H6213]] and he installed [[H5975]] priests [[H3548]] in Bethel [[H1008]] for the high places [[H1116]] he had set up. [[H6213]] 
33 On the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the eighth [[H8066]] month, [[H2320]] a month [[H2320]] of his own choosing, [[H908]] [Jeroboam] offered sacrifices [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] he had set up [[H6213]] in Bethel. [[H1008]] So he ordained [[H6213]] a festival [[H2282]] for the Israelites, [[H1121]] offered sacrifices [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] and burned incense. [[H6999]]
