1 Some time later, [[H310]] Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite [[H3158]] happened [[H1961]] to own [[H1961]] a vineyard [[H3754]] in Jezreel [[H3157]] next to [[H681]] the palace [[H1964]] of Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Samaria. [[H8111]] 
2 So Ahab [[H256]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Naboth, [[H5022]] “Give [[H5414]] me  your vineyard [[H3754]] to use [[H1961]] as a vegetable [[H3419]] garden, [[H1588]] since [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is next to [[H7138]] my palace. [[H1004]] I will give [[H5414]] you  a better [[H2896]] vineyard [[H3754]] in its place— [[H8478]] or if [[H518]] you prefer, [[H2896]] I will give [[H5414]] you  its [[H2088]] value [[H4242]] in silver. [[H3701]] 
3 But Naboth [[H5022]] replied, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] forbid [[H2486]] that I should give [[H5414]] you  the inheritance [[H5159]] of my fathers.” [[H1]] 
4 So Ahab [[H256]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] his palace, [[H1004]] sullen [[H5620]] and angry [[H2198]] because [[H5921]] Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite [[H3158]] had told him, [[H1696]] “I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] you  the inheritance [[H5159]] of my fathers.” [[H1]] He lay down [[H7901]] on [[H5921]] his bed, [[H4296]] turned his face [[H6440]] away, [[H5437]] and refused [[H3808]] to eat. [[H398]] 
5 Soon his wife [[H802]] Jezebel [[H348]] came in [[H935]] and asked, [[H1696]] “Why [[H4100]] are you [[H7307]] so [[H2088]] sullen [[H5620]] that you refuse [[H369]] to eat?” [[H398]] 
6 Ahab answered, [[H1696]] “Because [[H3588]] I spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite [[H3158]] and told [[H559]] him,  ‘Give [[H5414]] me  your vineyard [[H3754]] for silver, [[H3701]] or [[H176]] if [[H518]] you [[H859]] wish, [[H2655]] I will give [[H5414]] you  [another] vineyard [[H3754]] in its place.’ [[H8478]] And he said, [[H559]] ‘I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] you  my vineyard!’ [[H3754]] 
7 But his wife [[H802]] Jezebel [[H348]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Do you not [[H6258]] reign [[H4410]] over [[H5921]] Israel? [[H3478]] Get up, [[H6965]] eat [[H398]] some food, [[H3899]] and be cheerful, [[H3190]] for I [[H589]] will get [[H5414]] you  the vineyard [[H3754]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite.” [[H3158]] 
8 Then [Jezebel] wrote [[H3789]] letters [[H5612]] in Ahab’s [[H256]] name, [[H8034]] sealed them [[H2856]] with his seal, [[H2368]] and sent [[H7971]] [them] [[H5612]] to [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] and nobles [[H2715]] who [[H834]] lived [[H3427]] with [[H854]] Naboth [[H5022]] in his city. [[H5892]] 
9 In the letters [[H5612]] she wrote: [[H3789]] “Proclaim [[H7121]] a fast [[H6685]] and give [[H3427]] Naboth [[H5022]] a seat of honor [[H7218]] among the people. [[H5971]] 
10 But seat [[H3427]] two [[H8147]] scoundrels [[H1100]] opposite him [[H5048]] and have them testify, [[H5749]] ‘You have cursed [[H1288]] [both] God [[H430]] and the king!’ [[H4428]] Then take him out [[H3318]] and stone [[H5619]] him to death.” [[H4191]] 
11 So the elders [[H2205]] and nobles [[H2715]] who [[H834]] lived [[H3427]] in [Naboth's] city [[H5892]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Jezebel [[H348]] had instructed [[H7971]] in the letters [[H5612]] she had written [[H7971]] to them. [[H413]] 
12 They proclaimed [[H7121]] a fast [[H6685]] and gave [[H3427]] Naboth [[H5022]] a seat of honor [[H7218]] among the people. [[H5971]] 
13 And the two [[H8147]] scoundrels [[H1100]] came in [[H935]] and sat [[H3427]] opposite [Naboth], [[H5048]] and [these men] [[H1100]] testified [[H5749]] against [him] [[H5022]] before [[H5048]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] “Naboth [[H5022]] has cursed [[H1288]] God [[H430]] and the king!” [[H4428]] So they took him [[H3318]] outside [[H2351]] the city [[H5892]] and stoned him [[H5619]] to death. [[H4191]] 
14 Then they sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] Jezebel: [[H348]] “Naboth [[H5022]] has been stoned [[H5619]] to death.” [[H4191]] 
15 When Jezebel [[H348]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Naboth [[H5022]] had been stoned [[H5619]] to death, [[H4191]] she [[H348]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ahab, [[H256]] “Get up [[H6965]] and take possession of [[H3423]] the vineyard [[H3754]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite, [[H3158]] who [[H834]] refused [[H3985]] to give it [[H5414]] to you  for silver. [[H3701]] For [[H3588]] Naboth [[H5022]] is no longer [[H369]] alive, [[H2416]] but [[H3588]] dead. [[H4191]] 
16 And [[H1961]] when Ahab [[H256]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Naboth [[H5022]] was dead, [[H4191]] he [[H256]] got up [[H6965]] [and] went down [[H3381]] to take possession [[H3423]] of  the vineyard [[H3754]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite. [[H3158]] 
17 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite, [[H8664]] saying, [[H559]] 
18 “Get up [[H6965]] and go down [[H3381]] to meet [[H7125]] Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H834]] is in Samaria. [[H8111]] See, [he is] [[H2009]] in the vineyard [[H3754]] of Naboth, [[H5022]] of which [[H834]] he has gone [[H3381]] to take possession. [[H3423]] 
19 Tell [[H1696]] him [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Have you not murdered [a man] [[H7523]] and [[H1571]] seized his land?’ [[H3423]] Then tell him [[H1696]] that this is [also] what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘In the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the dogs [[H3611]] licked up [[H3952]] the blood [[H1818]] of Naboth, [[H5022]] [there also] the dogs [[H3611]] will lick up [[H3952]] your blood [[H1818]] yes, [[H1571]] yours!’ [[H859]] 
20 When Elijah [arrived], [[H452]] Ahab [[H256]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “So you have found me out, [[H4672]] my enemy.” [[H341]] He replied, [[H559]] “I have found [you] out [[H4672]] because [[H3282]] you have sold yourself [[H4376]] to do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
21 [This is what the LORD says]: [[H2005]] ‘I will bring [[H935]] calamity [[H7451]] on you [[H413]] and consume [[H1197]] your descendants; [[H310]] I will cut off [[H3772]] from Ahab [[H256]] every male [[H8366]] in Israel, [[H3478]] both slave [[H6113]] and free. [[H5800]] 
22 I will make [[H5414]] your house [[H1004]] like that [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] and like that [[H1004]] of Baasha [[H1201]] son [[H1121]] of Ahijah, [[H281]] because [[H413]] you have provoked [[H3707]] My anger [[H3708]] and caused Israel [[H3478]] to sin.’ [[H2398]] 
23 And the LORD [[H3068]] also [[H1571]] speaks [[H1696]] concerning Jezebel: [[H348]] ‘The dogs [[H3611]] will devour [[H398]] Jezebel [[H348]] by the wall [[H2428]] of Jezreel.’ [[H3157]] 
24 He who belongs to Ahab [[H256]] and dies [[H4191]] in the city [[H5892]] will be eaten [[H398]] by dogs, [[H3611]] and he who dies [[H4191]] in the field [[H7704]] will be eaten [[H398]] by the birds [[H5775]] of the air.’” [[H8064]] 
25 (Surely [[H7535]] there was [[H1961]] never [[H3808]] one like Ahab, [[H256]] who [[H834]] sold himself [[H4376]] to do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] incited [[H5496]] by his wife [[H802]] Jezebel. [[H348]] 
26 He committed the most [[H3966]] detestable acts [[H8581]] by going [[H1980]] after [[H310]] idols, [[H1544]] like [[H3605]] the Amorites [[H567]] the LORD [[H3068]] had driven out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites.) [[H1121]] 
27 When Ahab [[H256]] heard [[H8085]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] he tore [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] put [[H7760]] on sackcloth, [[H8242]] and fasted. [[H6684]] He lay down [[H7901]] in sackcloth [[H8242]] and walked around [[H1980]] meekly. [[H328]] 
28 Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite, [[H8664]] saying: [[H559]] 
29 “Have you seen [[H7200]] how [[H3588]] Ahab [[H256]] has humbled himself [[H3665]] before Me? [[H6440]] Because [[H3282]] he has humbled himself [[H3665]] before Me, [[H6440]] I will not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] the calamity [[H7451]] during his days, [[H3117]] but I will bring [[H935]] [it] [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] his house [[H1004]] in the days [[H3117]] of his son.” [[H1121]]
