1 Later, Solomon [[H8010]] formed an alliance [[H2859]] with [[H854]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] by marrying [[H3947]] [his] [[H6547]] daughter. [[H1323]] Solomon brought [[H935]] her to [[H413]] the City [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] until [[H5704]] he finished [[H3615]] building [[H1129]] his palace [[H1004]] and [[H853]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as well as [[H853]] the wall [[H2346]] around [[H5439]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
2 The people, [[H5971]] however, [[H7535]] were still sacrificing [[H2076]] on the high places [[H1116]] because [[H3588]] a house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had not [[H3808]] yet [[H5704]] been built. [[H1129]] 
3 And Solomon [[H8010]] loved [[H157]] the LORD, [[H3068]] walking [[H1980]] in the statutes [[H2708]] of his father [[H1]] David— [[H1732]] except that [[H7535]] he [[H1931]] sacrificed [[H2076]] and burned incense [[H6999]] on the high places. [[H1116]] 
4 Now the king [[H4428]] went [[H1980]] to Gibeon [[H1391]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] there, [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] it [was] [[H1931]] the great [[H1419]] high place. [[H1116]] Solomon [[H8010]] offered [[H5927]] a thousand [[H505]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] on [[H5921]] the [[H1931]] altar [there]. [[H4196]] 
5 One night [[H3915]] at Gibeon [[H1391]] the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Solomon [[H8010]] in a dream, [[H2472]] and God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Ask, [[H7592]] [and] I will give it [[H5414]] to you!”  
6 Solomon [[H8010]] replied, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] have shown [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] loving devotion [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] Your servant, [[H5650]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] because [[H834]] he walked [[H1980]] before You [[H6440]] in truth, [[H571]] righteousness, [[H6666]] and uprightness [[H3483]] of heart. [[H3824]] And You have kept [[H8104]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] loving devotion [[H2617]] by giving [[H5414]] him  a son [[H1121]] to sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his throne [[H3678]] this [[H2088]] very day. [[H3117]] 
7 And now, [[H6258]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] You [[H859]] {have made} Your servant [[H5650]] king [[H4427]] in my father [[H1]] David’s [[H1732]] place. [[H8478]] But I [am] [[H595]] only a little [[H6996]] child, [[H5288]] not [[H3808]] knowing [how] [[H3045]] to exit [[H3318]] or enter. [[H935]] 
8 Your servant [[H5650]] is here among [[H8432]] the people [[H5971]] You have chosen, [[H977]] a people [[H5971]] too numerous [[H7230]] to count [[H4487]] or number. [[H5608]] 
9 Therefore give [[H5414]] Your servant [[H5650]] an understanding [[H8085]] heart [[H3820]] to judge [[H8199]] Your people [[H5971]] and to discern [[H995]] between [[H996]] good [[H2896]] and evil. [[H7451]] For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] is able [[H3201]] to govern [[H8199]] this [[H2088]] great [[H3515]] people of Yours?” [[H5971]] 
10 Now it [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] the Lord [[H136]] that [[H3588]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made this request. [[H7592]] 
11 So God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Since [[H3282]] you have asked for [[H7592]] this [[H2088]] instead of [[H3808]] requesting [[H7592]] long [[H7227]] life [[H3117]] [or] [[H3808]] wealth for yourself [[H6239]] [or] [[H3808]] death [[H5315]] for your enemies— [[H341]] but you have asked [[H7592]] for discernment [[H995]] to administer [[H8085]] justice— [[H4941]] 
12 behold, [[H2009]] I will do [[H6213]] what you have asked. [[H1697]] I will give [[H5414]] you a wise [[H2450]] and discerning [[H995]] heart, [[H3820]] so that [[H834]] there will never [[H3808]] have been [[H1961]] anyone like [[H3644]] you, [[H6440]] [nor] will [[H310]] there ever [[H3808]] be. [[H6965]] 
13 Moreover, [[H1571]] I will give [[H5414]] you what [[H834]] you did not [[H3808]] request— [[H7592]] both [[H1571]] riches [[H6239]] and [[H1571]] honor— [[H3519]] so that [[H834]] during all [[H3605]] your days [[H3117]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] in any kingdom [[H4428]] will be [[H1961]] your equal. [[H3644]] 
14 So if [[H518]] you walk [[H1980]] in My ways [[H1870]] and keep [[H8104]] My statutes [[H2706]] and commandments, [[H4687]] just as [[H834]] your father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] did, [[H1980]] then I will prolong [[H748]] your days.” [[H3117]] 
15 Then Solomon [[H8010]] awoke, [[H3364]] and indeed it had been [[H2009]] a dream. [[H2472]] So he returned [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H136]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings. [[H8002]] Then he held [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] for all [[H3605]] his servants. [[H5650]] 
16 At that time [[H227]] two [[H8147]] prostitutes [[H2185]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] and stood [[H5975]] before him. [[H6440]] 
17 One [[H259]] woman [[H802]] said, [[H559]] “Please, [[H994]] my lord, [[H113]] this [[H2063]] woman [[H802]] and I [[H589]] live [[H3427]] in the same [[H259]] house, [[H1004]] and I gave birth [[H3205]] while she [was] [[H5973]] in the house. [[H1004]] 
18 On the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] after I gave birth, [[H3205]] this woman [[H802]] also [[H1571]] had a baby. [[H3205]] We [[H587]] were alone, [[H3162]] with [[H854]] no [[H369]] one [[H2114]] in the house [[H1004]] but [[H2108]] the two [[H8147]] of us. [[H587]] 
19 During the night [[H3915]] this [[H2063]] woman’s [[H802]] son [[H1121]] died [[H4191]] because [[H834]] she rolled over [[H7901]] on him. [[H5921]] 
20 So she got up [[H6965]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the night [[H3915]] and took [[H3947]] my son [[H1121]] from my side [[H681]] while [[H519]] I was asleep. [[H3463]] She laid him [[H7901]] in her bosom [[H2436]] and put [[H7901]] her dead [[H4191]] son [[H1121]] at my bosom. [[H2436]] 
21 The next morning, [[H1242]] when I got up [[H6965]] to nurse [[H3243]] my son, [[H1121]] I discovered [[H2009]] he was dead. [[H4191]] But when I examined him, [[H995]] I realized [[H2009]] that he was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] the son [[H1121]] I had borne.” [[H3205]] 
22 “No,” [[H3808]] said [[H559]] the other [[H312]] woman, [[H802]] “the living one [is] [[H2416]] my son [[H1121]] and the dead one [is] [[H4191]] your son.” [[H1121]] But the first woman [[H2063]] insisted, [[H559]] “No, [[H3808]] the dead one [is] [[H4191]] yours [[H1121]] and the living one [is] [[H2416]] mine.” [[H1121]] So they argued [[H1696]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]] 
23 Then the king [[H4428]] replied, [[H559]] “This [[H2063]] woman says, [[H559]] ‘My son [[H1121]] is alive [[H2416]] and yours [[H1121]] is dead,’ [[H4191]] but that [[H2063]] woman says, [[H559]] ‘No, [[H3808]] your son [[H1121]] is dead [[H4191]] and mine [[H1121]] is alive.’” [[H2416]] 
24 The king [[H4428]] continued, [[H559]] “Bring [[H3947]] me a sword.” [[H2719]] So they brought him [[H935]] a sword, [[H2719]] 
25 and the king [[H4428]] declared, [[H559]] “Cut [[H1504]] the living [[H2416]] child [[H3206]] in two [[H8147]] and give [[H5414]] half [[H2677]] to one [[H259]] and half [[H2677]] to the other.” [[H259]] 
26 Then the woman [[H802]] whose [[H834]] son [[H1121]] was alive [[H2416]] spoke [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] because [[H3588]] she yearned [[H3648]] with compassion [[H7356]] for [[H5921]] her son. [[H1121]] “My lord,” [[H113]] she said, [[H559]] “give [[H5414]] her  the living [[H2416]] baby. [[H3205]] Please [[H994]] do not [[H408]] kill him!” [[H4191]] But the other [[H2063]] [woman] said, [[H559]] “He will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] mine  or [[H1571]] yours.  Cut him in two!” [[H1504]] 
27 Then the king [[H4428]] gave his ruling: [[H559]] “Give [[H5414]] the living [[H2416]] baby [[H3205]] to the first woman.  By no means [[H3808]] should you kill him; [[H4191]] she [[H1931]] is his mother.” [[H517]] 
28 When all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]] of the judgment [[H4941]] the king [[H4428]] had given, [[H8199]] they stood in awe [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] [him], [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the wisdom [[H2451]] of God [[H430]] [was] in him [[H7130]] to administer [[H6213]] justice.
