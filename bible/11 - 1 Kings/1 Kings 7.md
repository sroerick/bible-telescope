1 Solomon, [[H8010]] however, [[H853]] took thirteen [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] to complete [[H3615]] the construction [[H1129]] of his entire [[H3605]] palace. [[H1004]] 
2 He built [[H1129]] the House [[H1004]] of the Forest [[H3293]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and thirty [[H7970]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H6967]] with [[H5921]] four [[H702]] rows [[H2905]] of cedar [[H730]] pillars [[H5982]] supporting [[H5921]] the cedar [[H730]] beams. [[H3773]] 
3 [The house] was roofed [[H5603]] with cedar [[H730]] above [[H4605]] the beams [[H6763]] that [[H834]] rested on [[H5921]] the pillars— [[H5982]] forty-five [beams], [[H705]] fifteen [[H2568]] per row. [[H2905]] 
4 There were three [[H7969]] rows [[H2905]] of [high] windows [[H8261]] facing each other [[H4237]] in three [[H7969]] tiers. [[H6471]] 
5 All [[H3605]] the doorways [[H6607]] had rectangular [[H7251]] frames, [[H8260]] with [[H4136]] the openings facing each other [[H4237]] [in] tiers [[H6471]] of three. [[H7969]] 
6 [Solomon] made [[H6213]] his colonnade [[H197]] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and thirty [[H7970]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] with a portico [[H197]] in front of it [[H5921]] and a canopy [[H5646]] with pillars [[H5982]] in front of [[H5921]] [the portico]. [[H6440]] 
7 In addition, he built [[H6213]] a hall [[H197]] for the throne, [[H3678]] the Hall [[H197]] of Justice, [[H4941]] where [[H834]] he was to judge. [[H8199]] It was paneled [[H5603]] with cedar [[H730]] from floor [[H7172]] to [[H5704]] ceiling. [[H7172]] 
8 And the palace [[H1004]] where [[H834]] [Solomon] would live, [[H3427]] set further back, [[H312]] was [[H1961]] of similar [[H2088]] construction. [[H4639]] He also made [[H6213]] a palace [[H1004]] like this [[H2088]] hall [[H197]] for Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] daughter, [[H1323]] whom [[H834]] [he] [[H8010]] had married. [[H3947]] 
9 All [[H3605]] these [buildings] [[H428]] were constructed with costly [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] cut [[H1496]] to size [[H4060]] and trimmed [[H1641]] with saws [[H4050]] inside [[H1004]] and out [[H2351]] from the foundation [[H4527]] to [[H5704]] the eaves, [[H2947]] from the outside [[H2351]] to [[H5704]] the great [[H1419]] courtyard. [[H2691]] 
10 The foundations [[H3245]] were [laid with] large, [[H1419]] costly [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] some eight [[H8083]] cubits [[H520]] and some [[H68]] ten [[H6235]] cubits [in length]. [[H520]] 
11 Above these [[H4605]] were high-grade [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] cut [[H1496]] to size, [[H4060]] and cedar beams. [[H730]] 
12 The great [[H1419]] courtyard [[H2691]] was surrounded by [[H5439]] three [[H7969]] rows [[H2905]] of dressed stone [[H1496]] and a row [[H2905]] of trimmed cedar [[H730]] beams, [[H3773]] as were the inner [[H6442]] courtyard [[H2691]] and portico [[H197]] of the house of [[H1004]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
13 Now King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] sent [[H7971]] to bring [[H3947]] Huram [[H2438]] from Tyre. [[H6865]] 
14 He [was] [[H1931]] the son of [[H1121]] a widow [[H490]] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] and his father [[H1]] was a man [[H376]] of Tyre, [[H6876]] a craftsman [[H2794]] in bronze. [[H5178]] Huram had great [[H4390]] skill, [[H2451]] understanding, [[H8394]] and knowledge [[H1847]] for every kind [[H3605]] of bronze [[H5178]] work. [[H4399]] So he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] and carried out [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] his work. [[H4399]] 
15 He cast [[H6696]] two [[H8147]] pillars [[H5982]] of bronze, [[H5178]] each [[H259]] eighteen [[H8083]] cubits [[H520]] high [[H6967]] and twelve [[H8147]] cubits [[H520]] in circumference. [[H2339]] 
16 He also made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] capitals [[H3805]] of cast [[H3332]] bronze [[H5178]] to set [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] top [[H7218]] of the pillars, [[H5982]] [each] [[H259]] capital [[H3805]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]] 
17 For the capitals [[H3805]] on [[H5921]] top [[H7218]] of the pillars [[H5982]] [he made] a network [[H4639]] of lattice, [[H7639]] with wreaths [[H1434]] of [[H4639]] chainwork, [[H8333]] seven [[H7651]] for [each] [[H259]] capital. [[H3805]] 
18 Likewise, he made [[H6213]] the pillars [[H5982]] with two [[H8147]] rows [[H2905]] of pomegranates [[H7416]] around [[H5439]] [each] [[H259]] grating [[H7639]] to cover [[H3680]] each capital [[H3805]] atop [the pillars]. [[H7218]] 
19 And the capitals [[H3805]] atop [[H7218]] the pillars [[H5982]] in the portico [[H197]] were shaped [[H4639]] like lilies, [[H7799]] four [[H702]] cubits [high]. [[H520]] 
20 On [[H5921]] the capitals [[H3805]] of both [[H8147]] pillars, [[H5982]] just [[H5980]] above [[H4605]] the rounded projection [[H990]] next to [[H5676]] the network, [[H7639]] [were] the two hundred [[H3967]] pomegranates [[H7416]] in rows [[H2905]] encircling [[H5439]] each capital. [[H3805]] 
21 Thus he set up [[H6965]] the pillars [[H5982]] at the portico [[H197]] of the temple. [[H1964]] The pillar [[H5982]] to the south [[H3233]] he named [[H7121]] Jachin, [[H3199]] and the pillar [[H5982]] to the north [[H8042]] he named [[H7121]] Boaz. [[H1162]] 
22 And [[H5921]] the tops [[H7218]] of the pillars [[H5982]] were shaped [[H4639]] like lilies. [[H7799]] So the work [[H4399]] of the pillars [[H5982]] was completed. [[H8552]] 
23 He also made [[H6213]] the Sea [[H3220]] of cast metal. [[H4165]] [It was] circular in shape, [[H5696]] measuring ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] from rim [[H8193]] to [[H5704]] [rim], [[H8145]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] in height, [[H6967]] and thirty [[H7970]] cubits [[H520]] in circumference. [[H6961]] 
24 Below [[H8478]] the rim, [[H8193]] ornamental buds [[H6497]] encircled [[H5439]] it, [[H853]] ten [[H6235]] per cubit [[H520]] all the way [[H5362]] around [[H5439]] the Sea, [[H3220]] cast [[H3332]] in two [[H8147]] rows [[H2905]] as a part of [the Sea]. [[H3333]] 
25 [The Sea] stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] twelve [[H8147]] oxen, [[H1241]] three [[H7969]] facing [[H6437]] north, [[H6828]] three [[H7969]] facing [[H6437]] west, [[H3220]] three [[H7969]] facing [[H6437]] south, [[H5045]] and three [[H7969]] facing [[H6437]] east. [[H4217]] [The Sea] [[H3220]] rested on them, [[H5921]] with all [[H3605]] their hindquarters [[H268]] toward the center. [[H1004]] 
26 It was a handbreadth [[H2947]] thick, [[H5672]] and its rim [[H8193]] was fashioned [[H4639]] like the brim [[H8193]] of a cup, [[H3563]] like a lily [[H7799]] blossom. [[H6525]] It could hold [[H3557]] two thousand [[H505]] baths. [[H1324]] 
27 In addition, he made [[H6213]] ten [[H6235]] movable stands [[H4350]] of bronze, [[H5178]] each [[H259]] four [[H702]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] four [[H702]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]] 
28 This [[H2088]] was the design [[H4639]] of the stands: [[H4350]] They had side panels [[H4526]] attached [[H996]] to uprights, [[H7948]] 
29 and on [[H5921]] the panels [[H4526]] between [[H996]] the uprights [[H7948]] were lions, [[H738]] oxen, [[H1241]] and cherubim. [[H3742]] On [[H5921]] the uprights [[H7948]] was a pedestal [[H3653]] above, [[H4605]] and below [[H8478]] the lions [[H738]] and oxen [[H1241]] were wreaths [[H3914]] of beveled [[H4174]] work. [[H4639]] 
30 Each [[H259]] stand [[H4350]] had four [[H702]] bronze [[H5178]] wheels [[H212]] with bronze [[H5178]] axles [[H5633]] and a basin [[H3595]] resting on [[H3802]] four [[H702]] supports, [[H3802]] with wreaths [[H3914]] at each [[H376]] side. [[H5676]] 
31 The opening [to each stand] [[H6310]] inside [[H1004]] the crown [[H3805]] at the top [[H4605]] [was] one cubit [deep], [[H520]] with a round [[H5696]] opening [[H6310]] like the design [[H4639]] of a pedestal, [[H3653]] a cubit [[H520]] and a half [wide]. [[H2677]] And around [[H1571]] its opening [[H6310]] [were] engravings, [[H4734]] but the panels [of the stands] were [[H4526]] square, [[H7251]] not [[H3808]] round. [[H5696]] 
32 There were four [[H702]] wheels [[H212]] under [[H8478]] the panels, [[H4526]] and the axles [[H3027]] of the wheels [[H212]] were attached to the stand; [[H4350]] each [[H259]] wheel [[H212]] [was] a cubit [[H520]] and a half [[H2677]] in diameter. [[H6967]] 
33 The wheels [[H212]] were made [[H4639]] like [[H4639]] chariot [[H4818]] wheels; [[H212]] their axles, [[H3027]] rims, [[H1354]] spokes, [[H2839]] and hubs [[H2840]] were all [[H3605]] of cast metal. [[H3332]] 
34 Each [[H259]] stand [[H4350]] had [[H413]] four [[H702]] handles, [[H3802]] [one for each] [[H702]] corner, [[H6438]] projecting [[H3802]] from [[H4480]] the stand. [[H4350]] 
35 At the top [[H7218]] of each stand [[H4350]] [was] a circular [[H5696]] band [[H5439]] half [[H2677]] a cubit [[H520]] high. [[H6967]] The supports [[H3027]] and panels [[H4526]] were cast as a unit [[H4480]] with [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of the stand. [[H4350]] 
36 He engraved [[H6605]] cherubim, [[H3742]] lions, [[H738]] and palm trees [[H8561]] on [[H5921]] the surfaces [[H3871]] of the supports [[H3027]] and [[H5921]] panels, [[H4526]] wherever each [[H376]] had space, [[H4626]] with wreaths [[H3914]] all around. [[H5439]] 
37 In this way [[H2063]] he made [[H6213]] the ten [[H6235]] stands, [[H4350]] each [[H3605]] with the same [[H259]] casting, [[H4165]] dimensions, [[H4060]] and shape. [[H7095]] 
38 He also made [[H6213]] ten [[H6235]] bronze [[H5178]] basins, [[H3595]] each [[H259]] holding [[H3557]] forty [[H705]] baths [[H1324]] and [[H259]] measuring four [[H702]] cubits across, [[H520]] one [[H259]] basin [[H3595]] for each [[H259]] of the ten [[H6235]] stands. [[H4350]] 
39 He set [[H5414]] five [[H2568]] stands [[H4350]] on [[H5921]] the south [[H3225]] side [[H3802]] of the temple [[H1004]] and five [[H2568]] on [[H5921]] the north, [[H8040]] and [[H853]] he put [[H5414]] the Sea [[H3220]] on the south [[H3233]] side, [[H3802]] at the southeast corner [[H6924]] of the temple. [[H1004]] 
40 In addition, Huram [[H2438]] made [[H6213]] the pots, [[H3595]] shovels, [[H3257]] and sprinkling bowls. [[H4219]] So Huram [[H2438]] finished [[H3615]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] he had undertaken [[H6213]] for King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] [in] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] 
41 the two [[H8147]] pillars; [[H5982]] the two [[H8147]] bowl-shaped [[H1543]] capitals [[H3805]] atop [[H7218]] the pillars; [[H5982]] the two [[H8147]] sets of network [[H7639]] covering [[H3680]] both [[H8147]] bowls [[H1543]] of the capitals [[H3805]] atop [[H7218]] the pillars; [[H5982]] 
42 the four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] pomegranates [[H7416]] for the two [[H8147]] sets of network [[H7639]] (two [[H8147]] rows [[H2905]] of pomegranates [[H7416]] for each [[H259]] network [[H7639]] covering [[H3680]] both [[H8147]] the bowl-shaped [[H1543]] capitals [[H3805]] atop [[H6440]] the pillars); [[H5982]] 
43 the ten [[H6235]] stands; [[H4350]] the ten [[H6235]] basins [[H3595]] on [[H5921]] the stands; [[H4350]] 
44 the Sea; [[H3220]] the twelve [[H8147]] oxen [[H1241]] underneath [[H8478]] the Sea; [[H3220]] 
45 and [[H853]] the pots, [[H5518]] shovels, [[H3257]] and sprinkling bowls. [[H4219]] All [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] that [[H834]] Huram [[H2438]] made [[H6213]] for King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] [in] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] were made of burnished [[H4803]] bronze. [[H5178]] 
46 The king [[H4428]] had them cast [[H3332]] in clay [[H4568]] molds [[H127]] in the plain [[H3603]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] between [[H996]] Succoth [[H5523]] and Zarethan. [[H6891]] 
47 Solomon {left} [[H8010]] all [[H3605]] these articles [[H3627]] unweighed, [[H3240]] because there were so [[H3966]] many. [[H7230]] The weight [[H4948]] of the bronze [[H5178]] could not [[H3808]] be determined. [[H2713]] 
48 Solomon [[H8010]] also made [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the furnishings [[H3627]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] the golden [[H2091]] altar; [[H4196]] the golden [[H2091]] table [[H7979]] on which [[H834]] was placed [[H5921]] the Bread [[H3899]] of the Presence; [[H6440]] 
49 the lampstands [[H4501]] of pure [[H5462]] gold [[H2091]] in front [[H6440]] of the inner sanctuary, [[H1687]] five [[H2568]] on the right [side] [[H3225]] and five [[H2568]] on the left; [[H8040]] the gold [[H2091]] flowers, [[H6525]] lamps, [[H5216]] and tongs; [[H4457]] 
50 the pure [[H5462]] gold [[H2091]] basins, [[H5592]] wick trimmers, [[H4212]] sprinkling bowls, [[H4219]] ladles, [[H3709]] and censers; [[H4289]] and the gold [[H2091]] hinges [[H6596]] for the doors [[H1817]] of the inner [[H6442]] temple [[H1004]] (that is, the Most Holy Place) [[H6944]] as well as for the doors [[H1817]] of the main hall [[H1004]] of the temple. [[H1964]] 
51 So all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] that [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] had performed [[H6213]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was completed. [[H7999]] Then Solomon [[H8010]] brought in [[H935]] the consecrated items [[H6944]] of his father [[H1]] David— [[H1732]] the silver, [[H3701]] the gold, [[H2091]] and [[H853]] the furnishings— [[H3627]] and he placed them [[H5414]] in the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
