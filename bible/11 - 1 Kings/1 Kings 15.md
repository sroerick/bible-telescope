1 In the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] Abijam [[H38]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Judah, [[H3063]] 
2 and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] three [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Maacah [[H4601]] daughter [[H1323]] of Abishalom. [[H53]] 
3 Abijam walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] that his father [[H1]] before him [[H6440]] had committed, [[H6213]] and his heart [[H3824]] was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] as fully devoted [[H8003]] to [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] as the heart [[H3824]] of David [[H1732]] his forefather [had been]. [[H1]] 
4 Nevertheless, [[H3588]] for the sake [[H4616]] of David, [[H1732]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] him  a lamp [[H5216]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] by raising up [[H6965]] a son [[H1121]] to succeed him [[H310]] and to make [[H5975]] Jerusalem {strong}. [[H3389]] 
5 For [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had done [[H6213]] what was right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and did not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] from anything [[H3605]] [the LORD] commanded [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life, [[H2416]] except [[H7535]] in the matter [[H1697]] of Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite. [[H2850]] 
6 And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of [Abijam's] life. [[H2416]] 
7 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Abijam, [[H38]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] And there was [[H1961]] also war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Abijam [[H38]] and Jeroboam. [[H3379]] 
8 And Abijam [[H38]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] and his son [[H1121]] Asa [[H609]] reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
9 In the twentieth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of Jeroboam's [[H3379]] reign [[H4428]] over Israel, [[H3478]] Asa [[H609]] became king [[H4427]] of Judah, [[H3063]] 
10 and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] forty-one [[H705]] years. [[H8141]] His grandmother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Maacah [[H4601]] daughter [[H1323]] of Abishalom. [[H53]] 
11 And Asa [[H609]] did [[H6213]] what was right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as David [[H1732]] his forefather [had done]. [[H1]] 
12 He banished [[H5674]] the male cult prostitutes [[H6945]] from [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] and removed [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] of the idols [[H1544]] that [[H834]] his fathers [[H1]] had made. [[H6213]] 
13 He also [[H1571]] removed [[H5493]] his grandmother [[H517]] Maacah [[H4601]] as the queen mother, [[H1377]] because [[H834]] she had made [[H6213]] a detestable [[H4656]] Asherah pole. [[H842]] Asa [[H609]] chopped down [[H3772]] the pole [[H4656]] and burned [[H8313]] it in the Kidron [[H6939]] Valley. [[H5158]] 
14 The high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] removed, [[H5493]] but [[H7535]] Asa’s [[H609]] heart [[H3824]] was [[H1961]] fully devoted [[H8003]] to [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3069]] all [[H3605]] his days. [[H3117]] 
15 And he brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] and other articles [[H3627]] that he [[H6944]] and his father [[H1]] had dedicated. [[H6944]] 
16 Now there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Asa [[H609]] and Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] throughout [[H3605]] their days. [[H3117]] 
17 Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] went to war [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and fortified [[H1129]] Ramah [[H7414]] to prevent [[H1115]] [anyone] from leaving [[H3318]] or entering the territory of [[H935]] Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]] 
18 So Asa [[H609]] withdrew [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] that remained [[H3498]] in the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H853]] of the royal [[H4428]] palace. [[H1004]] He entrusted it [[H5414]] to his servants [[H5650]] and sent [[H7971]] them to [[H413]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] son [[H1121]] of Tabrimmon, [[H2886]] the son [[H1121]] of Hezion [[H2383]] king [[H4428]] of Aram, [[H758]] who was ruling [[H3427]] in Damascus, [[H1834]] saying, [[H559]] 
19 “[Let there be] a treaty [[H1285]] between me and you, [[H996]] between [[H996]] my father [[H1]] and your father. [[H1]] See, [[H2009]] I have sent [[H7971]] you a gift [[H7810]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold. [[H2091]] Now go [[H1980]] and break [[H6565]] your treaty [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] so that he will withdraw [[H5927]] from me.” [[H5921]] 
20 And Ben-hadad [[H1130]] listened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] and sent [[H7971]] the commanders [[H8269]] of his armies [[H2428]] against [[H5921]] the cities [[H5892]] of Israel, [[H3478]] conquering [[H5221]] Ijon, [[H5859]] Dan, [[H1835]] Abel-beth-maacah, [[H62]] and [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] including [[H853]] the region [[H3605]] of Chinnereth. [[H3672]] 
21 When [[H1961]] Baasha [[H1201]] learned of this, [[H8085]] he stopped [[H2308]] fortifying [[H1129]] Ramah [[H7414]] and withdrew [[H3427]] to Tirzah. [[H8656]] 
22 Then King [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] made a proclamation [[H8085]] throughout [[H853]] all [[H3605]] Judah, [[H3063]] with no [[H369]] exception, [[H5355]] and they carried away [[H5375]] the stones [[H68]] of Ramah [[H7414]] and the timbers [[H6086]] Baasha [[H1201]] had used for building. [[H1129]] And with [these materials]  King [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] built up [[H1129]] Geba [[H1387]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] as well as [[H853]] Mizpah. [[H4709]] 
23 Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Asa, [[H609]] along with all [[H3605]] his might, [[H1369]] all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] and the cities [[H5892]] he built, [[H1129]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] In his old age, [[H2209]] however, [[H7535]] he became diseased [[H2470]] in his feet. [[H7272]] 
24 And Asa [[H609]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the City [[H5892]] of his father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] and his son [[H1121]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
25 In the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Asa's [[H609]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Nadab [[H5070]] son [[H1121]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and he reigned [[H4427]] two years. [[H8141]] 
26 And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of his father [[H1]] and in his sin, [[H2403]] which [[H834]] he had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit. [[H2398]] 
27 Then Baasha [[H1201]] son [[H1121]] of Ahijah [[H281]] of the house [[H1004]] of Issachar [[H3485]] conspired [[H7194]] against Nadab, [[H5921]] and Baasha [[H1201]] struck him down [[H5221]] at Gibbethon [[H1405]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] while Nadab [[H5070]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] were besieging [[H6696]] [the city]. [[H1405]] 
28 In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of Asa's [[H609]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Baasha [[H1201]] killed Nadab [[H4191]] and reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] 
29 As soon as [[H1961]] Baasha became king, [[H4427]] he struck down [[H5221]] the entire [[H3605]] household [[H1004]] of Jeroboam. [[H3379]] He did not [[H3808]] leave [[H7604]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] anyone [[H3605]] that breathed, [[H5397]] but destroyed them all [[H8045]] according to the word [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] His servant [[H5650]] Ahijah [[H281]] the Shilonite, [[H7888]] 
30 because [[H5921]] of the sins [[H2403]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] had committed [[H2398]] and [[H834]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit, [[H2398]] and because he had provoked [[H3707]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to anger. [[H3708]] 
31 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Nadab, [[H5070]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]] 
32 And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Asa [[H609]] and Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] throughout [[H3605]] their days. [[H3117]] 
33 In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of Asa's [[H609]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Baasha [[H1201]] son [[H1121]] of Ahijah [[H281]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and he reigned in Tirzah [[H8656]] twenty-four [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]] 
34 And [Baasha] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] and in his sin, [[H2403]] which [[H834]] he had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit. [[H2398]]
