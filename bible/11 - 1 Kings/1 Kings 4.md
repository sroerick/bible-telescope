1 So King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] ruled [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] 
2 and these [[H428]] were his chief officials: [[H8269]] Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Zadok [[H6659]] [was] the priest; [[H3548]] 
3 Elihoreph [[H456]] and Ahijah, [[H281]] the sons [[H1121]] of Shisha, [[H7894]] [were] secretaries; [[H5608]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] son [[H1121]] of Ahilud [[H286]] [was] the recorder; [[H2142]] 
4 Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] [was] in charge of [[H5921]] the army; [[H6635]] Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar [[H54]] [were] priests; [[H3548]] 
5 Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Nathan [[H5416]] [was] in charge of [[H5921]] the governors; [[H5324]] Zabud [[H2071]] son [[H1121]] of Nathan [[H5416]] [was] a priest [[H3548]] and adviser [[H7463]] to the king; [[H4428]] 
6 Ahishar [[H301]] [was] in charge of [[H5921]] the palace; [[H1004]] and Adoniram [[H141]] son [[H1121]] of Abda [[H5653]] [was] in charge of [[H5921]] the labor force. [[H4522]] 
7 Solomon [[H8010]] had twelve [[H8147]] governors [[H5324]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] to provide food [[H3557]] for the king [[H4428]] and his household. [[H1004]] [Each] one [[H259]] would arrange provisions [[H3557]] for one month [[H2320]] of the year, [[H8141]] 
8 and these [[H428]] were their names: [[H8034]] Ben-hur, [[H1133]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim; [[H669]] 
9 Ben-deker [[H1128]] in Makaz, [[H4739]] Shaalbim, [[H8169]] Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] and Elon-beth-hanan; [[H358]] 
10 Ben-hesed [[H1136]] in Arubboth [[H700]] (Socoh [[H7755]] and all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Hepher [[H2660]] belonged to him);  
11 Ben-abinadab [[H1125]] in Naphath-dor [[H5299]] (Taphath, [[H2955]] a daughter [[H1323]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] was [[H1961]] his wife); [[H802]] 
12 Baana [[H1195]] son [[H1121]] of Ahilud, [[H286]] in Taanach, [[H8590]] Megiddo, [[H4023]] and all [[H3605]] of Beth-shean [[H1052]] next to [[H681]] Zarethan [[H6891]] below [[H8478]] Jezreel, [[H3157]] from  Beth-shean [[H1052]] to [[H5704]] Abel-meholah [[H65]] and on past [[H5676]] Jokmeam; [[H3361]] 
13 Ben-geber [[H1127]] in Ramoth-gilead [[H7433]] (the villages [[H2333]] of Jair [[H2971]] son of Manasseh [[H4519]] in Gilead [[H1568]] [belonged] to him,  as well as the region [[H2256]] of Argob [[H709]] in Bashan [[H1316]] with its sixty [[H8346]] great [[H1419]] cities [[H5892]] with walls [[H2346]] and bronze [[H5178]] bars); [[H1280]] 
14 Ahinadab [[H292]] son [[H1121]] of Iddo, [[H5714]] in Mahanaim; [[H4266]] 
15 Ahimaaz [[H290]] in Naphtali [[H5321]] (he [[H1931]] had married [[H3947]] Basemath, [[H1315]] a daughter [[H1323]] of Solomon); [[H8010]] 
16 Baana [[H1195]] son [[H1121]] of Hushai [[H2365]] in Asher [[H836]] and in Aloth; [[H1175]] 
17 Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] son [[H1121]] of Paruah [[H6515]] in Issachar; [[H3485]] 
18 Shimei [[H8096]] son [[H1121]] of Ela [[H414]] in Benjamin; [[H1144]] 
19 Geber [[H1398]] son [[H1121]] of Uri [[H221]] in the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] the country [[H776]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites [[H567]] and of Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan. [[H1316]] He was the only [[H259]] governor [[H5333]] in the land [of Judah]. [[H776]] 
20 Judah [[H3063]] and Israel [[H3478]] [became] as numerous [[H7230]] as the sand [[H2344]] by [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] eating [[H398]] and drinking [[H8354]] and rejoicing. [[H8056]] 
21 And Solomon [[H8010]] reigned [[H4910]] over all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] from [[H4480]] the [Euphrates] [[H5104]] to the land [[H776]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] as far as [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] [These kingdoms] offered [[H5066]] tribute [[H4503]] and served [[H5647]] Solomon [[H8010]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life. [[H2416]] 
22 Solomon’s [[H8010]] provisions [[H3899]] for a single [[H259]] day [[H3117]] were [[H1961]] thirty [[H7970]] cors [[H3734]] of fine flour, [[H5560]] sixty [[H8346]] cors [[H3734]] of meal, [[H7058]] 
23 ten [[H6235]] fat [[H1277]] oxen, [[H1241]] twenty [[H6242]] range [[H7471]] oxen, [[H1241]] and a hundred [[H3967]] sheep, [[H6629]] as well as [[H905]] deer, [[H354]] gazelles, [[H6643]] roebucks, [[H3180]] and fattened [[H75]] poultry. [[H1257]] 
24 For [[H3588]] [Solomon] [[H1931]] had dominion [[H7287]] over everything [[H3605]] west [[H5676]] of the Euphrates— [[H5104]] over all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4428]] from Tiphsah [[H8607]] to [[H5704]] Gaza— [[H5804]] and he had [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] on all [[H3605]] sides. [[H5676]] 
25 Throughout [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] Judah [[H3063]] and Israel [[H3478]] lived [[H3427]] in safety [[H983]] from Dan [[H1835]] to [[H5704]] Beersheba, [[H884]] each man [[H376]] under [[H8478]] his own vine [[H1612]] and [[H8478]] his own fig tree. [[H8384]] 
26 Solomon [[H8010]] had [[H1961]] four [[H705]] thousand [[H505]] stalls [[H723]] for his chariot [[H4817]] horses [[H5483]] and twelve [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] horses. [[H6571]] 
27 Each [[H376]] month [[H2320]] the governors [[H5324]] in turn provided food [[H3557]] for King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] and all [[H3605]] who came [[H7131]] to [[H413]] [his] [[H4428]] table. [[H7979]] They saw to it that [[H5737]] nothing was lacking. [[H3808]] 
28 Each one [[H376]] also brought [[H935]] to [[H413]] the required place [[H4725]] their quotas [[H4941]] of barley [[H8184]] and straw [[H8401]] for the chariot horses [[H7409]] and other horses. [[H5483]] 
29 And God [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] Solomon [[H8010]] wisdom, [[H2451]] exceedingly [[H3966]] deep [[H7235]] insight, [[H8394]] and understanding [[H3820]] beyond measure, [[H7341]] like the sand [[H2344]] on [[H5921]] the seashore. [[H8193]] 
30 Solomon’s [[H8010]] wisdom [[H2451]] was greater than [[H7235]] [that] [[H2451]] of all [[H3605]] the men [[H1121]] of the East, [[H6924]] greater than all [[H3605]] the wisdom [[H2451]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
31 He was wiser [[H2449]] than all [[H3605]] men— [[H120]] wiser than Ethan [[H387]] the Ezrahite, [[H250]] and wiser than Heman, [[H1968]] Calcol, [[H3633]] and Darda, [[H1862]] the sons [[H1121]] of Mahol. [[H4235]] And his fame [[H8034]] spread [[H1961]] throughout [[H3605]] the surrounding [[H5439]] nations. [[H1471]] 
32 Solomon composed [[H1696]] three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] proverbs, [[H4912]] and his songs [[H7892]] numbered [[H1961]] a thousand [[H505]] and five. [[H2568]] 
33 He spoke [[H1696]] of trees, [[H6086]] from [[H4480]] the cedar [[H730]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] to [[H5704]] the hyssop [[H231]] growing [[H3318]] in the wall, [[H7023]] and he taught [[H1696]] about [[H5921]] animals, [[H929]] birds, [[H5775]] reptiles, [[H7431]] and fish. [[H1709]] 
34 So men of all [[H3605]] nations [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to listen [[H8085]] to Solomon’s [[H8010]] wisdom, [[H2451]] sent by all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] when they heard [[H8085]] of his wisdom. [[H2451]]
