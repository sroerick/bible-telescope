1 As the time [[H3117]] drew near [[H7126]] for David [[H1732]] to die, [[H4191]] he charged [[H6680]] his son [[H1121]] Solomon, [[H8010]] 
2 “I [[H595]] am about to go [[H1980]] the way [[H1870]] of all [[H3605]] of the earth. [[H776]] So be strong [[H2388]] and prove yourself [[H1961]] a man. [[H376]] 
3 And keep [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in His ways [[H1870]] and to keep [[H8104]] His statutes, [[H2708]] commandments, [[H4687]] ordinances, [[H4941]] and decrees, [[H5715]] as is written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] so that [[H4616]] you may prosper [[H7919]] in all [[H3605]] you do [[H6213]] and wherever [[H3605]] you turn, [[H6437]] 
4 and so that [[H4616]] the LORD [[H3068]] may fulfill [[H6965]] His promise [[H1697]] to me: [[H5921]] ‘If [[H518]] your descendants [[H1121]] take heed [[H8104]] to walk [[H1980]] in truth [[H571]] before Me [[H6440]] with all [[H3605]] their heart [[H3824]] and soul, [[H5315]] you will never [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] to have a man [[H376]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel.’ [[H3478]] 
5 Moreover, [[H1571]] you [[H859]] know [[H3045]] what [[H834]] Joab [[H3097]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] did [[H6213]] to me  [and] what [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] to Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner [[H5369]] and Amasa [[H6021]] son [[H1121]] of Jether, [[H3500]] the two [[H8147]] commanders [[H8269]] of the armies [[H6635]] of Israel. [[H3478]] He killed them [[H2026]] in peacetime [[H7965]] to avenge [[H7760]] the blood [[H1818]] of war. [[H4421]] He stained [[H5414]] with the blood [[H1818]] of war [[H4421]] the belt [[H2290]] around his waist [[H4975]] and the sandals [[H5275]] on his feet. [[H7272]] 
6 So act [[H6213]] according to your wisdom, [[H2451]] and do not [[H3808]] let his gray head [[H7872]] go down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] in peace. [[H7965]] 
7 But show [[H6213]] loving devotion [[H2617]] to the sons [[H1121]] of Barzillai [[H1271]] the Gileadite, [[H1569]] and let them be [[H1961]] among those who eat [[H398]] at your table, [[H7979]] because [[H3588]] they stood by [[H7126]] me [[H413]] when I fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] your brother [[H251]] Absalom. [[H53]] 
8 Keep an eye on [[H2009]] Shimei [[H8096]] the son [[H1121]] of Gera, [[H1617]] the Benjamite [[H1145]] with you [[H5973]] from Bahurim [[H980]] [who] [[H1931]] called down bitter [[H4834]] curses against me [[H7043]] on the day [[H3117]] I went [[H1980]] to Mahanaim. [[H4266]] But he [[H1931]] came down [[H3381]] to meet me [[H7125]] at the Jordan, [[H3383]] and I swore [[H7650]] to him  by the LORD: [[H3068]] I will never [[H518]] kill you [[H4191]] with the sword. [[H2719]] 
9 Now therefore, [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] hold him guiltless, [[H5352]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a wise [[H2450]] man. [[H376]] You know [[H3045]] what [[H834]] you ought to do [[H6213]] to him  to bring his gray head [[H7872]] down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] in blood.” [[H1818]] 
10 Then David [[H1732]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] 
11 The length [[H3117]] of David's [[H1732]] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] [was] forty [[H705]] years— [[H8141]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] in Hebron [[H2275]] and thirty-three [[H7970]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] 
12 So Solomon [[H8010]] sat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of his father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] and his kingdom [[H4428]] was firmly [[H3966]] established. [[H3559]] 
13 Now Adonijah [[H138]] son [[H1121]] of Haggith [[H2294]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Bathsheba [[H1339]] the mother [[H517]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] who asked, [[H559]] “Do you come [[H935]] in peace?” [[H7965]] “Yes, in peace,” [[H7965]] he replied. [[H559]] 
14 Then he said, [[H559]] “I  have something [to tell] [[H1697]] you.” [[H413]] “Say it,” [[H1696]] she answered. [[H559]] 
15 “You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the kingship [[H4410]] was mine,” [[H1961]] he said. [[H559]] “All [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] expected [[H5921]] that I should reign, [[H4427]] but the kingship [[H4410]] has turned [[H5437]] to my brother, [[H251]] for [[H3588]] it has come [[H1961]] to him [[H1961]] from the LORD. [[H3068]] 
16 So now [[H6258]] I [[H595]] have just one [[H259]] request [[H7596]] of you; [[H853]] do not [[H408]] deny [[H7725]] me.” [[H6440]] “State [your request],” [[H1696]] she told [[H559]] him. [[H413]] 
17 [Adonijah] replied, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] speak [[H559]] to King [[H4428]] Solomon, [[H8010]] since [[H3588]] he will not [[H3808]] turn you down. [[H7725]] Let him give [[H5414]] me  Abishag [[H49]] the Shunammite [[H7767]] as my wife.” [[H802]] 
18 “Very well,” [[H2896]] Bathsheba [[H1339]] replied. [[H559]] “I [[H595]] will speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] for you.” [[H5921]] 
19 So Bathsheba [[H1339]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] to speak [[H1696]] to him  for [[H5921]] Adonijah. [[H138]] The king [[H4428]] stood up [[H6965]] to greet her, [[H7125]] bowed [[H7812]] to her,  and sat down [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his throne. [[H3678]] Then [the king] had a throne [[H3678]] brought [[H7760]] for [his] [[H4428]] mother, [[H517]] [who] sat down [[H3427]] at his right hand. [[H3225]] 
20 “I [[H595]] have just one [[H259]] small [[H6996]] request of you,” [[H7596]] she said. [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] deny [[H7725]] me.” [[H6440]] “Make your request, [[H7592]] my mother,” [[H517]] the king [[H4428]] replied, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] deny [[H7725]] you.” [[H6440]] 
21 So [Bathsheba] said, [[H559]] “Let Abishag [[H49]] the Shunammite [[H7767]] be given [[H5414]] to your brother [[H251]] Adonijah [[H138]] as his wife.” [[H802]] 
22 King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] answered [[H6030]] his mother, [[H517]] “Why [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] request [[H7592]] Abishag [[H49]] the Shunammite [[H7767]] for Adonijah? [[H138]] Since [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is my older [[H1419]] brother, [[H251]] you might as well request [[H7592]] the kingdom [[H4410]] for him  and for Abiathar [[H54]] the priest [[H3548]] and for Joab [[H3097]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah. [[H6870]] 
23 Then King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] swore [[H7650]] by the LORD: [[H3068]] “May God [[H430]] punish [[H3541]] me,  and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if [[H3588]] Adonijah [[H138]] has not made [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] request [[H1697]] at the expense of his life. [[H5315]] 
24 And now, [[H6258]] as surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives— [[H2416]] the One [[H834]] who established me, [[H3559]] who set me [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] and who founded [[H6213]] for me  a dynasty [[H1004]] as [[H834]] He promised— [[H1696]] surely [[H3588]] Adonijah [[H138]] shall be put to death [[H4191]] today!” [[H3117]] 
25 So King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] sent the order [[H7971]] to [[H3027]] Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] who struck down [[H6293]] Adonijah,  and he died. [[H4191]] 
26 Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to Abiathar [[H54]] the priest, [[H3548]] “Go back [[H1980]] to [[H5921]] your fields [[H7704]] in Anathoth. [[H6068]] Even though [[H3588]] you [[H859]] deserve to die, [[H4194]] I will not [[H3808]] put you to death [[H4191]] at this [[H2088]] time, [[H3117]] since [[H3588]] you carried [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] before [[H6440]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] and you suffered [[H6031]] through all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] my father [[H1]] suffered. [[H6031]] 
27 So Solomon [[H8010]] banished [[H1644]] Abiathar [[H54]] from [[H1961]] the priesthood [[H3548]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and so fulfilled [[H4390]] the word [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] at Shiloh [[H7887]] against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Eli. [[H5941]] 
28 When the news [[H8052]] reached [[H935]] Joab, [[H3097]] [who] [[H3097]] had conspired [[H5186]] with [[H310]] Adonijah [[H138]] but [[H310]] not [[H3808]] with [[H5186]] Absalom, [[H53]] [he] [[H3097]] fled [[H5127]] to [[H413]] the tent [[H168]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and took hold [[H2388]] of the horns [[H7161]] of the altar. [[H4196]] 
29 It was reported [[H5046]] to King [[H4428]] Solomon: [[H8010]] “Joab [[H3097]] has fled [[H5127]] to [[H413]] the tent [[H168]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and is now [[H2009]] beside [[H681]] the altar.” [[H4196]] So Solomon [[H8010]] sent [[H7971]] Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] saying, [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] strike him down!” [[H6293]] 
30 And Benaiah [[H1141]] entered [[H935]] the tent [[H168]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and said [[H559]] to Joab, [[H413]] “The king [[H4428]] says, [[H559]] ‘Come out!’” [[H3318]] But Joab replied, [[H559]] “No, [[H3808]] I will die [[H4191]] here.” [[H6311]] So Benaiah [[H1141]] relayed the message [[H1697]] to the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] “This is how [[H3541]] Joab [[H3097]] answered me.” [[H6030]] 
31 And the king [[H4428]] replied, [[H559]] “Do [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] he says. [[H1696]] Strike him down [[H6293]] and bury him, [[H6912]] and so remove [[H5493]] from me [[H5921]] and from [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of my father [[H1]] the innocent [[H2600]] blood [[H1818]] that [[H834]] Joab [[H3097]] shed. [[H8210]] 
32 The LORD [[H3068]] will bring [[H7725]] his bloodshed [[H1818]] back upon [[H5921]] his own head, [[H7218]] for [[H834]] without [[H3808]] the knowledge [[H3045]] of my father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] he struck down [[H6293]] two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] more righteous [[H6662]] and better [[H2896]] than he [[H4480]] when he killed [[H2026]] with the sword [[H2719]] Abner [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] commander [[H8269]] of Israels [[H3478]] army, [[H6635]] and Amasa [[H6021]] son [[H1121]] of Jether, [[H3500]] commander [[H8269]] of Judahs [[H3063]] army. [[H6635]] 
33 Their blood [[H1818]] will come back [[H7725]] upon the heads [[H7218]] of Joab [[H3097]] [and] [[H7218]] his descendants forever; [[H2233]] but for David, [[H1732]] his descendants, [[H2233]] his house, [[H1004]] and his throne, [[H3678]] there shall be [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] from [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] forever.” [[H5704]] 
34 So Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] went up, [[H5927]] struck down Joab, [[H6293]] and killed him. [[H4191]] He was buried [[H6912]] at his own home [[H1004]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] 
35 And the king [[H4428]] appointed [[H5414]] Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] in Joab’s place [[H8478]] over [[H5921]] the army, [[H6635]] and he appointed [[H5414]] Zadok [[H6659]] the priest [[H3548]] in Abiathar’s [[H54]] place. [[H8478]] 
36 Then the king [[H4428]] summoned [[H7971]] Shimei [[H8096]] and said [[H559]] to him,  “Build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for yourself  in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and live [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] but do not [[H3808]] go [[H3318]] anywhere else. [[H575]] 
37 On the day [[H3117]] you go out [[H3318]] and cross [[H5674]] the Kidron [[H6939]] Valley, [[H5158]] know for sure [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you will die; [[H4191]] your blood [[H1818]] will be [[H1961]] on your own head.” [[H7218]] 
38 “The sentence [[H1697]] is fair,” [[H2896]] Shimei [[H8096]] replied. [[H559]] “Your servant [[H5650]] will do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] has spoken.” [[H1696]] And Shimei [[H8096]] lived [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] for a long [[H7227]] time. [[H3117]] 
39 After [[H7093]] three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] however, [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] of Shimei’s [[H8096]] slaves [[H5650]] ran away [[H1272]] to [[H413]] Achish [[H397]] son [[H1121]] of Maacah, [[H4601]] king [[H4428]] of Gath. [[H1661]] And Shimei [[H8096]] was told, [[H5046]] “Behold, [[H2009]] your slaves [[H5650]] are in Gath.” [[H1661]] 
40 So Shimei [[H8096]] saddled [[H2280]] his donkey [[H2543]] and set out [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Achish [[H397]] at Gath [[H1661]] in search of [[H1245]] his slaves, [[H5650]] and he brought them [[H5650]] back [[H935]] from Gath. [[H1661]] 
41 When it was reported [[H5046]] to Solomon [[H8010]] that [[H3588]] Shimei [[H8096]] had gone [[H1980]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Gath [[H1661]] and had returned, [[H7725]] 
42 the king [[H4428]] summoned [[H7971]] Shimei [[H8096]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Did I not [[H3808]] make you swear [[H7650]] by the LORD [[H3068]] and warn [[H5749]] you,  ‘On the day [[H3117]] you leave [[H3318]] and go [[H1980]] elsewhere, [[H575]] know for sure [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you will die’? [[H4191]] And you told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] ‘The sentence [[H1697]] is fair; [[H2896]] I will comply.’ [[H8085]] 
43 So why [[H4069]] have you not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] your oath [[H7621]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H853]] the command [[H4687]] that [[H834]] I gave you?” [[H6680]] 
44 The king [[H4428]] also said, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] in your heart [[H3824]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] you did [[H6213]] to my father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] Therefore the LORD [[H3068]] will bring [[H7725]] your evil [[H7451]] back upon your head. [[H7218]] 
45 But King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] will be blessed [[H1288]] and David’s [[H1732]] throne [[H3678]] will remain [[H1961]] secure [[H3559]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] forever.” [[H5704]] 
46 Then the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] and he went out [[H3318]] and struck Shimei down, [[H6293]] and he died. [[H4191]] Thus the kingdom [[H4467]] was firmly established [[H3559]] in the hand [[H3027]] of Solomon. [[H8010]]
