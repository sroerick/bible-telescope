1 King [[H4428]] Solomon, however, [[H8010]] loved [[H157]] many [[H7227]] foreign [[H5237]] women [[H802]] along with the daughter [[H1323]] of Pharaoh— [[H6547]] women of Moab, [[H4125]] Ammon, [[H5984]] Edom, [[H130]] and Sidon, [[H6722]] as well as Hittite women. [[H2850]] 
2 [These women were] from [[H4480]] the nations [[H1471]] about which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] had told [[H559]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “You must not [[H3808]] intermarry [[H935]] with them,  for surely [[H403]] they will turn [[H5186]] your hearts [[H3824]] after [[H310]] their gods.” [[H430]] Yet Solomon [[H8010]] clung [[H1692]] to these [women]  in love. [[H160]] 
3 He had [[H1961]] seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] wives [[H802]] of royal birth [[H8282]] and three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] concubines— [[H6370]] and his wives [[H802]] turned his heart [[H3820]] away. [[H5186]] 
4 For when [[H6256]] Solomon [[H8010]] grew [[H1961]] old, [[H2209]] his wives [[H802]] turned [[H5186]] his heart [[H3824]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and he was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] wholeheartedly [[H3824]] devoted [[H8003]] to [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] as his father [[H1]] David had been. [[H1732]] 
5 Solomon [[H8010]] followed [[H1980]] Ashtoreth [[H6253]] the goddess [[H430]] of the Sidonians [[H6722]] and Molech [[H4445]] the abomination [[H8251]] of the Ammonites. [[H5984]] 
6 So Solomon [[H8010]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] and unlike his father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] he did not [[H3808]] follow [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] completely. [[H4390]] 
7 At that time [[H227]] on a hill [[H2022]] east [[H5921]] of [[H6440]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Solomon [[H8010]] built [[H1129]] a high place [[H1116]] for Chemosh [[H3645]] the abomination [[H8251]] of Moab [[H4124]] and for Molech [[H4432]] the abomination [[H8251]] of the Ammonites. [[H1121]] 
8 He did [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] for all [[H3605]] his foreign [[H5237]] wives, [[H802]] who burned incense [[H6999]] and sacrificed [[H2076]] to their gods. [[H430]] 
9 Now the LORD [[H3068]] grew angry [[H599]] with Solomon, [[H8010]] because [[H3588]] his heart [[H3824]] had turned away [[H5186]] from [[H5973]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who had appeared [[H7200]] to him [[H413]] twice. [[H6471]] 
10 Although He had warned [Solomon] [[H6680]] explicitly [[H5921]] not [[H1115]] to follow [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] Solomon did not [[H3808]] observe [[H8104]] what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded. [[H6680]] 
11 Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to Solomon, [[H8010]] “Because [[H3282]] you have done [[H1961]] this [[H2063]] and have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] My covenant [[H1285]] and My statutes, [[H2708]] which [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] you, [[H5921]] I will tear [[H7167]] the kingdom [[H4467]] away [[H7167]] from you [[H5921]] and give it [[H5414]] to your servant. [[H5650]] 
12 Nevertheless, [[H389]] for the sake [[H4616]] of your father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] I will not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] it during your lifetime; [[H3117]] I will tear it [[H7167]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of your son. [[H1121]] 
13 Yet [[H7535]] I will not [[H3808]] {tear} the whole [[H3605]] kingdom [[H4467]] away from him. [[H7167]] I will give [[H5414]] one [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] to your son [[H1121]] for the sake [[H4616]] of My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] and for the sake [[H4616]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] I have chosen.” [[H977]] 
14 Then the LORD [[H3068]] raised up [[H6965]] against Solomon [[H8010]] an adversary, [[H7854]] Hadad [[H1908]] the Edomite, [[H130]] from the royal [[H4428]] line [[H2233]] of Edom. [[H123]] 
15 Earlier, [[H1961]] when David [[H1732]] was [[H1961]] in Edom, [[H123]] Joab [[H3097]] the commander [[H8269]] of the army [[H6635]] had gone [[H5927]] to bury [[H6912]] the dead [[H2491]] and had struck down [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] in Edom. [[H123]] 
16 For [[H3588]] Joab [[H3097]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] had stayed [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] six [[H8337]] months, [[H2320]] until [[H5704]] he had killed [[H3772]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] in Edom. [[H123]] 
17 But Hadad, [[H1908]] still just [[H376]] a young [[H6996]] boy, [[H5288]] had fled [[H1272]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] along with [[H854]] some Edomites [[H130]] who were servants [[H5650]] of his father. [[H1]] 
18 Hadad and his men set out [[H6965]] from Midian [[H4080]] and went [[H935]] to Paran. [[H6290]] They took [[H3947]] men [[H582]] from Paran [[H6290]] with them [[H5973]] and went [[H935]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] who gave [[H5414]] Hadad  a house [[H1004]] and land [[H776]] and provided [[H559]] him  with food. [[H3899]] 
19 There Hadad [[H1908]] found [[H4672]] such great [[H3966]] favor [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] that he gave [[H5414]] to him  in marriage [[H802]] the sister [[H269]] of Queen [[H1377]] Tahpenes, [[H8472]] his own wife. [[H802]] 
20 And the sister [[H269]] of Tahpenes [[H8472]] bore [[H3205]] [Hadad]  a son [[H1121]] named Genubath. [[H1592]] Tahpenes [[H8472]] herself weaned [[H1580]] him in [[H8432]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] palace, [[H1004]] and Genubath [[H1592]] lived [[H1961]] there [[H1004]] among [[H8432]] the sons [[H1121]] of Pharaoh. [[H6547]] 
21 When Hadad [[H1908]] heard [[H8085]] in Egypt [[H4714]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] had rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and that [[H3588]] Joab, [[H3097]] the commander [[H8269]] of the army, [[H6635]] was dead, [[H4191]] he [[H1908]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] “Let me go, [[H7971]] so I may return [[H1980]] to [[H413]] my own country. [[H776]] 
22 But Pharaoh [[H6547]] asked him, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] have you [[H859]] lacked [[H2638]] here with me [[H5973]] that you suddenly [[H2005]] want [[H1245]] to go back [[H1980]] to [[H413]] your own country?” [[H776]] “Nothing,” [[H3808]] [Hadad] replied, [[H559]] “but [[H3588]] please let me go.” [[H7971]] 
23 And God [[H430]] raised up [[H6965]] against [Solomon]  [another] adversary, [[H7854]] Rezon [[H7331]] the son [[H1121]] of Eliada, [[H450]] who [[H834]] had fled [[H1272]] from [[H853]] his master, [[H113]] Hadadezer [[H1909]] king [[H4428]] of Zobah [[H6678]] 
24 and had gathered [[H6908]] men [[H376]] to himself. [[H5921]] When David [[H1732]] killed [[H2026]] the Zobaites, [[H853]] [Rezon] captained [[H1961]] a band [of raiders] [[H1416]] and went [[H1980]] to Damascus, [[H1834]] where they settled [[H3427]] and gained control. [[H4427]] 
25 Rezon was [[H1961]] Israel’s [[H3478]] enemy [[H7854]] throughout [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] adding to [[H854]] the trouble [[H7451]] [caused by] [[H834]] Hadad. [[H1908]] So [Rezon] ruled [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Aram [[H758]] with hostility [[H6973]] toward Israel. [[H3478]] 
26 Now Solomon’s [[H8010]] servant, [[H5650]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] was an Ephraimite [[H673]] from [[H4480]] Zeredah, [[H6868]] and his mother [[H517]] [was] a widow [[H490]] named [[H8034]] Zeruah. [[H6871]] Jeroboam rebelled [[H7311]] against Solomon, [[H4428]] 
27 and this [[H2088]] is the account [[H1697]] of his rebellion [[H7311]] against the king. [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] had built [[H1129]] the supporting terraces [[H4407]] and repaired [[H5462]] the gap in the wall [[H6556]] of the city [[H5892]] of his father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] 
28 And [[H376]] Jeroboam [was] [[H3379]] a mighty man [[H1368]] of valor, [[H2428]] so Solomon [[H8010]] noticed [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the young man [[H5288]] was [[H1931]] industrious [[H4399]] and put him in charge [[H6485]] of the whole [[H3605]] labor force [[H5447]] of the house [[H1004]] of Joseph. [[H3130]] 
29 During [[H1961]] that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] the prophet [[H5030]] Ahijah [[H281]] the Shilonite [[H7888]] met [[H4672]] [Jeroboam] [[H853]] on the road [[H1870]] as [he] [[H3379]] was going out [[H3318]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Now Ahijah [[H1931]] had wrapped himself [[H3680]] in a new [[H2319]] cloak, [[H8008]] and the two [[H8147]] of them were alone [[H905]] in the open field. [[H7704]] 
30 And Ahijah [[H281]] took hold [[H8610]] of the new [[H2319]] cloak [[H8008]] he was wearing, [[H5921]] tore it [[H7167]] into twelve [[H8147]] pieces, [[H7168]] 
31 and said [[H559]] to Jeroboam, [[H3379]] “Take [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] pieces [[H7168]] for yourself,  for [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I will tear [[H7167]] the kingdom [[H4467]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] and I will give [[H5414]] you  ten [[H6235]] tribes. [[H7626]] 
32 But one [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] will remain [[H1961]] for the sake [[H4616]] of My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] and for the sake [[H4616]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the city [[H5892]] I chose [[H977]] out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
33 For [[H3282]] they have [[H834]] forsaken Me [[H5800]] to worship [[H7812]] Ashtoreth [[H6253]] the goddess [[H430]] of the Sidonians, [[H6722]] Chemosh [[H3645]] the god [[H430]] of the Moabites, [[H4124]] and Molech [[H4445]] the god [[H430]] of the Ammonites. [[H1121]] They have not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in My ways, [[H1870]] nor done [[H6213]] what is right [[H3477]] in My eyes, [[H5869]] nor [kept] My statutes [[H2708]] and judgments, [[H4941]] as Solomon's father [[H1]] David did. [[H1732]] 
34 Nevertheless, I will not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] the whole [[H3605]] kingdom [[H4467]] out of [Solomon's] hand, [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] I have made him [[H7896]] ruler [[H5387]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life [[H2416]] for the sake [[H4616]] of David [[H1732]] My servant, [[H5650]] whom [[H834]] I chose [[H977]] because [[H834]] he kept [[H8104]] My commandments [[H4687]] and statutes. [[H2708]] 
35 But I will take [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] tribes [[H7626]] of the kingdom [[H4410]] from the hand [[H3027]] of his son [[H1121]] and give them [[H5414]] to you.  
36 I will give [[H5414]] one [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] to his son, [[H1121]] so that [[H4616]] My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] will always [[H3605]] have [[H1961]] a lamp [[H5216]] before Me [[H6440]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the city [[H5892]] where [[H834]] I chose [[H977]] to put [[H7760]] My name. [[H8034]] 
37 But as for you, [[H853]] I will take you, [[H3947]] and you shall reign [[H4427]] over all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] your heart [[H5315]] desires, [[H183]] and you will be [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
38 If [[H518]] you listen to [[H8085]] all that [[H3605]] I command you, [[H6680]] walk [[H1980]] in My ways, [[H1870]] and do [[H6213]] what is right [[H3477]] in My sight [[H5869]] in order to keep [[H8104]] My statutes [[H2708]] and commandments [[H4687]] as [[H834]] My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] did, [[H6213]] then I will be [[H1961]] with you. [[H5973]] I will build [[H1129]] you a lasting [[H539]] dynasty [[H1004]] just as [[H834]] I built [[H1129]] for David, [[H1732]] and I will give [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] to you.  
39 Because [[H4616]] of this, [[H2063]] I will humble [[H6031]] David’s [[H1732]] descendants— [[H2233]] but [[H389]] not [[H3808]] forever.’” [[H3605]] 
40 Solomon [[H8010]] therefore sought [[H1245]] to kill [[H4191]] Jeroboam. [[H3379]] But Jeroboam [[H3379]] arose [[H6965]] and fled [[H1272]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] to [[H413]] Shishak [[H7895]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] where [[H4714]] he remained [[H1961]] until [[H5704]] the death [[H4194]] of Solomon. [[H8010]] 
41 As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Solomon— [[H8010]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] as well as his wisdom— [[H2451]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Acts [[H1697]] of Solomon? [[H8010]] 
42 Thus, the time [[H3117]] that Solomon [[H8010]] reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] [was] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]] 
43 And Solomon [[H8010]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the city [[H5892]] of his father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] And his son [[H1121]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
