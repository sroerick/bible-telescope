1 At that time [[H227]] Solomon [[H8010]] assembled [[H6950]] before [[H413]] him [[H4428]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel— [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the tribal [[H4294]] heads [[H7218]] and family leaders [[H5387]] of the Israelites— [[H1121]] to bring up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] from Zion, [[H6726]] the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] 
2 And all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] came together [[H6950]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] at the feast [[H2282]] in the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] the month [[H3391]] of Ethanim. [[H388]] 
3 When all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] had arrived, [[H935]] the priests [[H3548]] took up [[H5375]] the ark, [[H727]] 
4 and they brought up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H853]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] with [[H853]] all [[H3605]] [its] [[H168]] sacred [[H6944]] furnishings. [[H3627]] So the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] carried them up. [[H5927]] 
5 There, before [[H6440]] the ark, [[H727]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] who had assembled [[H3259]] with him [[H5921]] sacrificed [[H2076]] so many [[H7230]] sheep [[H6629]] and oxen [[H1241]] that [[H834]] they could not [[H3808]] be counted [[H5608]] or numbered. [[H4487]] 
6 Then the priests [[H3548]] brought [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] its place [[H4725]] in [[H413]] the inner sanctuary [[H1687]] of the temple, [[H1004]] the Most Holy Place, [[H6944]] beneath [[H8478]] the wings [[H3671]] of the cherubim. [[H3742]] 
7 For [[H3588]] the cherubim [[H3742]] spread [[H6566]] their wings [[H3671]] over [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of the ark [[H727]] and overshadowed [[H5526]] the ark [[H727]] and [[H5921]] its poles. [[H905]] 
8 The poles [[H905]] were so long [[H748]] that their [[H905]] ends [[H7218]] could be seen [[H7200]] from [[H4480]] the Holy Place [[H6944]] in [[H5921]] front [[H6440]] of the inner sanctuary, [[H1687]] but not [[H3808]] from outside [the Holy Place]; [[H2351]] and they are [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
9 [There was] nothing [[H369]] in the ark [[H727]] except [[H7535]] the two [[H8147]] stone [[H68]] tablets [[H3871]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had placed [[H3240]] in it [[H8033]] at Horeb, [[H2722]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had made a covenant [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] the Israelites [[H1121]] after they had come out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] 
10 And [[H1961]] when the priests [[H3548]] came out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the Holy Place, [[H6944]] the cloud [[H6051]] filled [[H4390]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] 
11 so that the priests [[H3548]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] stand there [[H5975]] to minister [[H8334]] because [[H6440]] of the cloud; [[H6051]] for [[H3588]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
12 Then [[H227]] Solomon [[H8010]] said: [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has said [[H559]] that He would dwell [[H7931]] in the thick cloud. [[H6205]] 
13 I have indeed built [[H1129]] You  an exalted [[H2073]] house, [[H1004]] a place [[H4349]] for You to dwell [[H3427]] forever.” [[H5769]] 
14 And as the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] stood [there], [[H5975]] the king [[H4428]] turned around [[H5437]] and blessed [[H1288]] [them] all [[H3605]] 
15 and said: [[H559]] “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] [who] [[H834]] has fulfilled [[H4390]] with His own hand [[H3027]] what He spoke [[H1696]] with His mouth [[H6310]] to [[H854]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] 
16 ‘Since [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] I brought My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] I have not [[H3808]] chosen [[H977]] a city [[H5892]] from any [[H3605]] tribe [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] [in which] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] so that My Name [[H8034]] would be [[H1961]] there. [[H8033]] But I have chosen [[H977]] David [[H1732]] to be [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] 
17 Now it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] the heart [[H3824]] of my father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
18 But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] ‘Since [[H3282]] it was [[H1961]] in your heart [[H3824]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for My Name, [[H8034]] you have done well [[H2895]] to have this [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] your heart. [[H3824]] 
19 Nevertheless, [[H7535]] you [[H859]] are not [[H3808]] the one to build it; [[H1129]] but [[H3588]] your son, [[H1121]] your own offspring, [[H3318]] will build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] for My Name.’ [[H8034]] 
20 Now the LORD [[H3068]] has fulfilled [[H6965]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] He spoke. [[H1696]] I have succeeded [[H6965]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] and I sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] promised. [[H1696]] I have built [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] 
21 And there I have provided [[H7760]] a place [[H4725]] for the ark, [[H727]] which contains [[H834]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] He made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] our fathers [[H1]] when He brought them out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt.” [[H4714]] 
22 Then Solomon [[H8010]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in front of [[H5048]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] spread out [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] toward heaven, [[H8064]] 
23 and said: [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] there is no [[H369]] God [[H430]] like You [[H3644]] in heaven [[H8064]] above [[H4605]] or on [[H5921]] earth [[H776]] below, [[H8478]] keeping [[H8104]] [Your] covenant [[H1285]] of loving devotion [[H2617]] with Your servants [[H5650]] who walk [[H1980]] before You [[H6440]] with all [[H3605]] their hearts. [[H3820]] 
24 You have kept [[H8104]] Your promise [[H1696]] to Your servant, [[H5650]] my father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] What You spoke [[H1696]] with Your mouth [[H6310]] You have fulfilled [[H4390]] with Your hand [[H3027]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] 
25 Therefore now, [[H6258]] O LORD, [[H3069]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] keep [[H8104]] for Your servant, [[H5650]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] what [[H834]] You promised [[H1696]] when You said: [[H559]] ‘You will never [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] to have a man [[H376]] to sit [[H3427]] before Me [[H6440]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel, [[H3478]] if [[H518]] only [[H7535]] your descendants [[H1121]] guard [[H8104]] their way [[H1870]] to walk [[H1980]] before Me [[H6440]] as [[H834]] you have [done]. [[H1980]] 
26 And now, [[H6258]] O God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] please [[H4994]] confirm [[H539]] what [[H834]] You promised [[H1697]] to Your servant, [[H5650]] my father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] 
27 But [[H3588]] will God [[H430]] indeed [[H552]] dwell [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the earth? [[H776]] Even [[H2009]] heaven, [[H8064]] the highest heaven, [[H8064]] cannot [[H3808]] contain You, [[H3557]] much less [[H637]] this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] I have built. [[H1129]] 
28 Yet regard [[H6437]] the prayer [[H8605]] and [[H413]] plea [[H8467]] of Your servant, [[H5650]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] so that You may hear [[H8085]] the cry [[H7440]] and the prayer [[H8605]] that [[H834]] Your servant [[H5650]] is praying [[H6419]] before You [[H6440]] today. [[H3117]] 
29 May Your eyes [[H5869]] be [[H1961]] open [[H6605]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] night [[H3915]] and day, [[H3117]] toward [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of which [[H834]] You said, [[H559]] ‘My Name [[H8034]] shall be [[H1961]] there,’ [[H8033]] so that You may hear [[H8085]] the prayer [[H8605]] that [[H834]] Your servant [[H5650]] prays [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]] 
30 Hear [[H8085]] the plea [[H8467]] of Your servant [[H5650]] and of Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] when [[H834]] they pray [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]] May You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from [[H413]] heaven, [[H8064]] Your dwelling [[H3427]] place. [[H4725]] May You hear [[H8085]] and forgive. [[H5545]] 
31 When [[H834]] a man [[H376]] sins [[H2398]] against his neighbor [[H7453]] and is required [[H5378]] to take an oath, [[H423]] and he comes [[H935]] to take an oath [[H423]] before [[H6440]] Your altar [[H4196]] in this [[H2088]] temple, [[H1004]] 
32 may You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from heaven [[H8064]] and act. [[H6213]] May You judge [[H8199]] Your servants, [[H5650]] condemning [[H7561]] the wicked man [[H7563]] by bringing [[H5414]] down on his own head [[H7218]] what he has done, [[H1870]] and justifying [[H6663]] the righteous man [[H6662]] by rewarding [[H5414]] him  according to his righteousness. [[H6666]] 
33 When Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] are defeated [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] an enemy [[H341]] because [[H834]] they have sinned against You, [[H2398]] and they return [[H7725]] to You [[H413]] and confess [[H3034]] Your name, [[H8034]] praying [[H6419]] and pleading [[H2603]] with You [[H413]] in this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] 
34 may You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from heaven [[H8064]] and forgive [[H5545]] the sin [[H2403]] of Your people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] May You restore [[H7725]] them to [[H413]] the land [[H127]] You gave [[H5414]] to their fathers. [[H1]] 
35 When the skies [[H8064]] are shut [[H6113]] and there is [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain [[H4306]] because [[H3588]] [Your people] have sinned [[H2398]] against You,  and they pray [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and confess [[H3034]] Your name, [[H8034]] and they turn [[H7725]] from their sins [[H2403]] because [[H3588]] You have afflicted them, [[H6031]] 
36 may You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from heaven [[H8064]] and forgive [[H5545]] the sin [[H2403]] of Your servants, [[H5650]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] so that [[H3588]] You may teach them [[H3384]] the good [[H2896]] way [[H1870]] in which [[H834]] they should walk. [[H1980]] May You send [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] on [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] You gave [[H5414]] Your people [[H5971]] as an inheritance. [[H5159]] 
37 When [[H3588]] famine [[H7458]] [or] [[H1961]] pestilence [[H1698]] comes [[H1961]] upon the land, [[H776]] [or] [[H3588]] blight [[H7711]] [or] mildew [[H3420]] [or] locusts [[H697]] [or] grasshoppers, [[H2625]] when [[H3588]] their enemy [[H341]] besieges [[H6887]] them  in [[H776]] their cities, [[H8179]] whatever [[H3605]] plague [[H5061]] [or] [[H3605]] sickness [there is], [[H4245]] 
38 may whatever [[H3605]] prayer [[H8605]] or petition [[H8467]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] make— [[H1961]] each [[H376]] knowing [[H3045]] his own [[H3824]] afflictions [[H5061]] and spreading out [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house— [[H1004]] 
39 be heard [[H8085]] by You [[H859]] from heaven, [[H8064]] Your dwelling [[H3427]] place. [[H4349]] And may You forgive [[H5545]] and act, [[H6213]] and repay [[H5414]] each man [[H376]] according to all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] since [[H834]] You know [[H3045]] his heart— [[H3824]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] alone [[H905]] know [[H3045]] the hearts [[H3824]] of all [[H3605]] men— [[H120]] 
40 so that [[H4616]] they may fear You [[H3372]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] they [[H1992]] live [[H2416]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] You gave [[H5414]] to our fathers. [[H1]] 
41 And [[H1571]] as for [[H413]] the foreigner [[H5237]] who [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] of Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] but has come [[H935]] from a distant [[H7350]] land [[H776]] because of [[H4616]] Your name— [[H8034]] 
42 for [[H3588]] they will hear [[H8085]] of Your great [[H1419]] name [[H8034]] and mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] and outstretched [[H5186]] arm— [[H2220]] when he comes [[H935]] and prays [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] 
43 may You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from heaven, [[H8064]] Your dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] and do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] for which [[H834]] the foreigner [[H5237]] calls [[H7121]] to You. [[H413]] Then [[H4616]] all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] will know [[H3045]] Your name [[H8034]] and fear [[H3372]] You, [[H853]] as [do] Your people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] I have built [[H1129]] is called [[H7121]] by Your Name. [[H8034]] 
44 When [[H3588]] Your people [[H5971]] go [[H3318]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] their enemies, [[H341]] wherever [[H1870]] You send them, [[H7971]] and when they pray [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the direction [[H1870]] of the city [[H5892]] You have chosen [[H977]] and the house [[H1004]] I have built [[H1129]] for Your Name, [[H8034]] 
45 may You hear [[H8085]] from heaven [[H8064]] their prayer [[H8605]] and [[H853]] their plea, [[H8467]] and may You uphold [[H6213]] their cause. [[H4941]] 
46 When [[H3588]] they sin [[H2398]] against You—  for [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] one [[H120]] who [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] sin— [[H2398]] and You become angry [[H599]] with them  and deliver them [[H5414]] to [[H6440]] an enemy [[H341]] who takes them [[H7617]] as captives [[H7617]] to [[H413]] his own [[H341]] land, [[H776]] whether far [[H7350]] or [[H176]] near, [[H7138]] 
47 and when they come [[H7725]] to [[H413]] their senses [[H3820]] in the land [[H776]] to which [[H834]] they were taken, [[H7617]] and they repent [[H7725]] and plead [[H2603]] with You [[H413]] in the land [[H776]] of their captors, [[H7617]] saying, [[H559]] ‘We have sinned [[H2398]] and done wrong; [[H5753]] we have acted wickedly,’ [[H7561]] 
48 and when they return [[H7725]] to You [[H413]] with all [[H3605]] their heart [[H3824]] and [[H3605]] soul [[H5315]] in the land [[H776]] of the enemies [[H341]] who [[H834]] took them captive, [[H7617]] and when they pray [[H6419]] to You [[H413]] in the direction [[H1870]] of the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] You gave [[H5414]] to their fathers, [[H1]] the city [[H5892]] You have chosen, [[H977]] and the house [[H1004]] I have built [[H1129]] for Your Name, [[H8034]] 
49 then may You hear [[H8085]] from heaven, [[H8064]] Your dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] their prayer [[H8605]] and petition, [[H8467]] and may You uphold [[H6213]] their cause. [[H4941]] 
50 May You forgive [[H5545]] Your people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] have sinned [[H2398]] against You  and all [[H3605]] the transgressions [[H6588]] they have committed [[H6586]] against You,  and may You grant them [[H5414]] compassion [[H7356]] in the eyes [[H6440]] of their captors [[H7617]] to show them mercy. [[H7355]] 
51 For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are Your people [[H5971]] and Your inheritance; [[H5159]] You brought them [[H834]] out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out [[H8432]] of the furnace [[H3564]] for iron. [[H1270]] 
52 May Your eyes [[H5869]] be [[H1961]] open [[H6605]] to [[H413]] the pleas [[H8467]] of Your servant [[H5650]] and [[H413]] [of] [[H8467]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and may You listen [[H8085]] to them [[H413]] whenever [[H3605]] they call [[H7121]] to You. [[H413]] 
53 For [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] as Your inheritance, [[H5159]] have set them apart [[H914]] from all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] of the earth, [[H776]] as [[H834]] You spoke [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] Your servant [[H5650]] Moses [[H4872]] when You brought [[H3318]] our fathers [[H1]] out of Egypt.” [[H4714]] 
54 Now when [[H1961]] Solomon [[H8010]] finished [[H3615]] praying [[H6419]] this [[H2063]] entire [[H3605]] prayer [[H8605]] and petition [[H8467]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] he got up [[H6965]] before [[H6440]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] where he had been kneeling [[H3766]] with his hands [[H3709]] spread out [[H6566]] toward heaven. [[H8064]] 
55 And he stood [[H5975]] and blessed [[H1288]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] in a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] saying: [[H559]] 
56 “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] has given [[H5414]] rest [[H4496]] to His people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] He promised. [[H1696]] Not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] word [[H1697]] has failed [[H5307]] of all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] promises [[H1697]] He made [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] His servant [[H5650]] Moses. [[H4872]] 
57 May the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] be [[H1961]] with us, [[H5973]] as [[H834]] He was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] our fathers. [[H1]] May He never [[H408]] leave us [[H5800]] [or] [[H408]] forsake us. [[H5203]] 
58 May He incline [[H5186]] our hearts [[H3824]] to Himself, [[H413]] to walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] His ways [[H1870]] and to keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] He commanded [[H6680]] our fathers. [[H1]] 
59 And may [[H1961]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] with which [[H834]] I have made my petition [[H2603]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] be near [[H7126]] to the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] so that He may uphold [[H6213]] the cause [[H4941]] of His servant [[H5650]] [and] [[H4941]] of His people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] as each day [[H3117]] requires, [[H1697]] 
60 so that [[H4616]] all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is God. [[H430]] There is no [[H369]] other! [[H5750]] 
61 So let your heart [[H3824]] be [[H1961]] fully devoted [[H8003]] to [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] as it is [[H3117]] this day, [[H2088]] to walk [[H1980]] in His statutes [[H2706]] and to keep [[H8104]] His commandments.” [[H4687]] 
62 Then the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with him [[H5973]] offered [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] 
63 And Solomon [[H8010]] offered as [[H2076]] peace offerings [[H8002]] to the LORD [[H3068]] 22,000 {} [[H6242]] oxen [[H1241]] and 120,000 [[H3967]] sheep. [[H6629]] So the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] dedicated [[H2596]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] 
64 On that same [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the king [[H4428]] consecrated [[H6942]] the middle [[H8432]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] in front [[H6440]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] he offered [[H6213]] the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] the grain offerings, [[H4503]] and the fat [[H2459]] of the peace offerings, [[H8002]] since [[H3588]] the bronze [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] was too small [[H6996]] to contain [[H3557]] [all these offerings]. [[H5930]] 
65 So at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Solomon [[H8010]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with him— [[H5973]] a great [[H1419]] assembly of people [[H6951]] from Lebo-hamath [[H2574]] to [[H5704]] the Brook [[H5158]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] observed [[H6213]] the feast [[H2282]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] for seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] and seven [more] [[H7651]] days— [[H3117]] fourteen [[H702]] days in all. [[H3117]] 
66 On the [fifteenth] [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] [Solomon] sent the people [[H5971]] away. [[H7971]] So they blessed [[H1288]] the king [[H4428]] and went [[H1980]] home, [[H168]] joyful [[H8056]] and glad [[H2896]] in heart [[H3820]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the good things [[H2896]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had done [[H6213]] for His servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] and for His people [[H5971]] Israel.
